0	            I will never book through Expedia again. I wanted to cancel my reservation due to change in plans, and they stated that they could not refund the money but they could change it. I then asked if I change the date and the price is difference, will I get the difference back and they stated that I would. Now they are saying that they cannot refund me my difference because they did not take the money, the hotel did.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	neutral
1	            I really regret and feel bad that I have been a customer with Expedia for more than 4 years!         I booked a flight with Royal Jordanian Airlines flight from Riyadh to Amman to Barcelona, on December 13 through Expedia. However, I just got a call from Expedia on December 7th tilling me that my flight was cancelled! I told the Agent that I paid for a protection plan; dose protect me in such of like this situation? The Agent told me “ Yes sir”, we will cancel your flight with Royal Jordanian Airlines and we will book a similar flight for you ( with Turkish airline). I ask the agent a clear question, am I going to be the one who is responsible for the extra charges? The agent said no, and we ( speaking on behave of Expedia) will get back to you with in less than 24 hours. However, I received no respond after 24 hours. Then, I called Expedia but the other agent told me something totally different. She said that we have to wait more; and if there is an extra charge for booking the other flight, I will be paying for it. I told her that the agent yesterday told me something different but this could not help. I was on the line for almost 3 hours trying to get any solution! At the end I had to book a new flight from Riyadh to Amman to catch my flight from Amman to Barcelona, and I paid for the whole amount! After being a loyal customers with expedient for more than 4 years, I will never do any of my booking with a company that not honest, not helpful, and does not give any value to its customers!        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	neutral

7	            WHY IT PAYS NOT TO BOOK HOTEL ACCOMMODATION THROUGH ONLINE HOTELBOOKING SITES SUCH AS EXPEDIA.Expedia cannot be graded. It does not deserve any stars. Being in a hospitality industry, Expedia has failed to learn the first rule of building a satisfactory relationship with its long time loyal customer.Very recently, although expensive, at a personal cost of £307.85, Expedia has taught me a lesson on HOW TO SAVE MONEY ON HOTEL BOOKINGS. I am sharing this lesson so that you fellow travellers also can save substantial amount of money on your hotel bookings.Towards the end of September 2018, I had booked a hotel accommodation in Switzerland through Expedia. Unfortunately, the accommodation did not turn out the way Expedia had presented on its site. After returning home I filed a complaint. Expedia refused to accept my reasons for being unable to occupy the room and to acknowledge that it had misrepresented the hotel facilities on its web site. Instead, it offered to refund me £50.00 voucher for the inconvenience. Upon further complaining, it even had the audacity to say that the refund of £50 was a final gesture and the complaint could not be entertained any further and I should consider the matter closed. I somehow managed to escalate my complaint and after a long time it further offered to refund £100. However, I requested for the full amount of £307.85 which I had paid for the accommodation which was just not suitable to occupy. Since the hotel itself could not arrange a suitable alternative accommodation I was forced to search for another hotel, very late at night, in an unknown country. To my dismay I quickly found that most hotels close reservations/check in for the day by 10.30pm in Switzerland. But luckily enough, I found an understanding manager at another hotel to provide accommodation for the night.Expedia, as of today, has not replied to my last email of 17th November 2018 nor has it refunded my £307.85. Expedia call centre staff spent considerable time pretending that I did stay overnight at the hotel before finally admitting that I did not occupy the room. One manager even absurdly declared to me that this did not sound like a fraud case!!! It took Expedia a long time to really realise that this was a genuine concern. I gradually understood that these were their tactics to passing the buck from one manager to another and delay taking a decision.Needless to say that £307.85 will really reflect a huge increase in Expedia profits on their accounting date but at the cost of a loyal customer now permanently lost.Why it pays NOT to book through online hotel booking agents:I realised this on the same holiday in Switzerland when I stayed at another 4 star independent hotel. At its reception were notices urging guests to recommend to their friends to book their stay with the hotel directly and save up to 30% on accommodation tariff as compared with online hotel booking sites. I also learnt from the same hotel about the exorbitant commissions charged by the online hotel booking sites for advertising them on their websites. After paying hefty commissions to businesses like Expedia their well being is greatly affected and standard refurbishments of the facilities become impossible with meagre profits left for survival.There are many advantages of booking a hotel directly:1. Most independent and chain hotels will give you considerably lower rate of accommodation as compared to online hotel booking sites like Expedia.2. It will give you a precise idea regarding the accommodation offered because it represents its own business and would not like its reputation to be jeopardized in any way. Besides personal attention they will only offer exactly what they have rather than companies like Expedia which rely upon information/description as given to them and ending up with incorrect representation of the facility. Such marketing dearly costs hard earned money for travellers who book at such sites in good faith but in return do not get what the site advertises when they actually arrive at the hotel. Companies like Expedia and its associated businesses perhaps rely on travellers’ experiences who have visited/stayed at their advertised hotels. Perhaps this is another way of adding profits by categorising reviews written by travellers. It is like selling sugar syrup labelled as honey.3. Research has shown that more and more independent and chain hotels now focus on direct bookings as part of their overall business strategy. They have seen a big percentage increase in direct booking through loyal customers. With direct booking, middleman/online hotel booking sites, who charge high commissions and force their terms and conditions to such hotels, become obsolete. Commissions so saved enable hotels to pass on lower accommodation rates and additional benefits to guests which otherwise would not have been possible. At the same time the hotels see increase in their profit margins. Hence both the traveller/guest and the hotel benefit leaving out online hotel booking agents/sites.FINALLY, HOW TO USE ONLINE HOTEL BOOKING SITES SUCH AS EXPEDIA TO MAKE HUGE SAVINGS:Simply visit their site. Check out the location and the hotel where you would like a reservation. Find the hotel details from Google. Directly phone or email the hotel. You would be surprised to know how much you could save by just directly contacting the hotel.Save a lot and have a great holiday.The trend for hotel booking is changing. Book directly with the hotel.Say bye bye to online hotel booking sites.2nd December 2018.        	                4	1	Sunday	expedia	positive

9	            WORST travel website I advise you not to book via Expedia, I’ve been on the phone to him for 1 hour attempting to get a refund on a hotel within 10 minutes of booking as the website had a malfunction and it booked me into wrong dates. The customer service was absolutely dreadful and the man on the other end of the line giving the customer service was extremely rude and aggressive, it took a call to the manager of the hotel and several staff to call them to clarify I am able to get a refund. EXPEDIA IS A SCAM AND WILL KEEP YOUR MONEY. Worst bloody hour of my life.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
10	            I booked a hotel stay through Expedia and purchased the travel insurance.  When I forced to cancel my travel plans, AIG the insurance group that sold me the plan through Expedia's website, refused to reimburse my travel expenses because they did not think my reason was sufficient.  While I recognize that AIG is a 3rd party group, it is being represented through Expedia.  I will not be using Expedia ever again.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
11	            I searched multiple ways, spending many hours to get high end accommodations at several locations in southern CA on recent road trip finding online listings advertising dog-friendly rooms. Most of the time the hotels as well as TripAdvisor directed us to Expedia to book the hotels we'd selected. Each time, 5 out of 5 reservations within a 2-week period, Expedia told us that the hotel was NOT pet friendly despite the online advertising, and they directed us to less satisfactory properties. Only when we spoke directly with the del Coronado Hotel did we get properly accommodated.        	                1	2	Saturday	expedia	neutral
12	"            I tried to make a reservation with a hotel in Dallas. I thought I was talking to the hotel, but instead, I was talking to an Expedia agent. I bought a ""non-refundable"" package for four nights. A day later the plans changed. I could not get a refund or change the date without losing the total amount. I could understand if it was two days before the arrival date, but it was a month away and it was only two days after the original booking. I will NEVER deal with Expedia again for any reason. I advise you not to do so either.        "	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	positive
13	            I went to Japan and booked with Expedia.  I landed in Tokyo where I was to catch a flight to Osaka.  The flight had been cancelled due to weather.  Expedia was most unhelpful.  I ended up taking a train for over $200.  Expedia refunded me $32 when the cheapest flight was over $200.  I suspect that they deducted fees and $32 was all that was left.  Dealing with customer service was painful.  All responses were generic and always written as though it was the last word.  There was no attempt to resolve the problem or help me find a solution.  I will never use this company again.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative
14	            Worst customer service ever. Booked a flight Fukuoka to Incheon. Missed my flight due to traffic at the parking lot. Yes I said that. japan is the most efficient country in the world and the parking was backed up. I dropped my fiancé to check in and I was trying to park and missed my flight. Any how, I called Expedia to get the next flight. Of course I knew I was going to sit on hold a long time. I told them I know there is a penalty. Check get me on the next flight. Finally after 55 minutes of holding and paying $1.00 a minute they tell me the airline canceled both my departing and return flight due to weather.  The weather was perfect in japan and sought Korea! They said we can’t call today November 22 approx 1200 noon because the office is closed. I laughed and said the Asiana corporate office is in South Korea same time zone as me. Then the poor customer service lady is like I’m sorry I can call you tomorrow about your refund. I can book you another flight though. I said why would the airline cancel the flights they have been paid already. No answer, I thought she hung up. Then I say hello! She says I’m sorry I don’t know why. I said you had to say something to them to make them cancel the flight. What did you say? No comment. I asked again. I said you could have put them on hold and told me about the cancel fee like I already knew and got me a one way ticket since I had return tickets paid for!  You answered for me! That’s not right I said. Expedia wants to hold my refund I said and book me another flight. How many people have you done this to? Earliest flight they could offer me was 8pm. Ridiculous. I said I will just book with Jin Air at the airport. Which I did for 1440 departure and $100+ cheaper than what Expedia was trying to do. They lost a customer for sure! Btw. I went to the Asiana desk since I was right next to them when I was on the phone with Expedia. They said we can’t cancel a flight that has been paid for. Expedia canceled it. They showed me the computer screen. Sure enough Expedia requested them to cancel it. Expedia said eventually after persisting that it was canceled due to excessive fees for no show. Which was a lie because me fiancé had already checked in for our flight. So it was not a no show. Expedia canceled it and wouldn’t admit it. I told the the rep that I know you are trying to help me but Expedia’s policies are getting in the way. She said nothing because she knew I was right. I told her she could call me tomorrow about my refund but I will be in Seoul and can’t answer the phone. I’m currently on my short vacation I’m Seoul and Expedia didn’t even send me an email saying sorry for anything! What a joke of a company. I told the rep I’m going to spread the word to every veteran, active duty, and DOD employee I know about what happened to me and not to use this crap company!

15	            I have always used Expedia and have never had an issue, I can see a lot of people giving Expedia 1 star as they wouldn't amend their holiday, but this is clearly explained in terms and conditions that you are TOLD about when you book.The customer service team may be a bit pushy, which is why I always book online, but I have never found a cheaper deal than Expedia.        	                12	5	Friday	expedia	neutral
16	            Please do not use Expedia. They Are running a scam and ripping people off. I made a hotel reservation on Expedia.  The Hotel provided me  with a copy of my receipt upon checkout. The hotel actually charged less than what Expedia charged me. But I contacted Expedia to find out about a refund on the overcharge, they were not interested in a refund. All they wanted to know was where I got a copy of the receipt.   Apparently they advertise they have the lowest hotel rates, but you would be better off contacting the hotel personally yourself for a cheaper rate.    I spent 45 minutes on a chat with a customer service representative and to supervisors and got nowhere. They have no customer service. They don’t appreciate their customers. Please go somewhere else for your travel needs.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive
17	            They purposely alter your scheduled date so you are forced to pay a cancellation fee. I doubled checked THREE TIMES that I had the correct date, then the confirmation email says the wrong date. I called them 10 seconds after booking and they said they couldn't fix the error. They said they would try to contact the hotel to see of they could accommodate the date I actually wanted. I sat on hold for a bit before telling me they couldn't get through. I called the hotel myself and immediately got through.. The concierge was befuddled as to why Expedia would have any issues getting through. He then said he would alter the dates for me and give Expedia a call. Expedia calls me back and says that they can not accommodate my request and needed to pay a cancellation fee. I told them the hotel literally just corrected the error and its just a matter of adjusting the date on their end. They said they would call the hotel, I go on hold again. They return to say that the hotel in question doesn't have my edited reservation and that I need to pay a cancelation fee. I call the hotel AGAIN. He confirms again that, yes, my reservation has been reset for the correct date. Expedia then says the rates changed, so I need to pay more. I told them that the hotel confirmed to me that the rates did NOT change. Then Expedia tells me I need to pay a processing fee!! This company is just blandly screwing their customers. Then they offered me $50 off my next purchase with Expedia, but it can't be used for this purchase. Lol, what? Why?  Just kidding, we all know why. Expedia is a scamming garbage company.

19	            I made reservations for my children to come visit me during Christmas. When I booked their return flight, I clicked one that got them back home at 11:21 PM. There was no proofing option before you finalize. It just booked the tickets and ended up changing the return flight to one that gets in at 1:43 am the next day.When I emailed my concern to Expedia, they responded: “Based on research, no error was found on our site and reservation was booked based on preferences selected. Therefore, Expedia regrets to inform you that your exchange request without any fee has been denied.” When I challenged this response and requested screen shots of my clicks to support their position Expedia said “We have seen that our specialized team already conducted an investigation on your case and they found no error on our website and the booking was processed based on your preferences. Therefore, your request has been denied.”Quite the “bait and switch” scam…. I’ll never use Expedia again.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative

23	            Worst of the Worst!Be careful when booking air-travel with them.  Make sure to confirm with the airline you are selecting regarding baggage fees, prior to your purchase.  You might think you are getting a good deal, until you get to the airport and are surprised with a $150 US dollar baggage fee from the airline for your first bag.Expedia does not disclose baggage fees prior to purchasing your airfare. Air Europa has a baggage fee of $100-$150 US dollars for first bag, and you do not know until you get to the airport.  The only choice you have when you get to the airport if you do not have the money, is either leave your baggage, or lose your flight!  I had to call my daughter to go online and pay for the baggage online $100, at the airport they charge $150 US dollars!

At 7 weeks I contacted Expedia because that seems like a long time to wait for a refund. They would not speak to me. On Nov 6, exactly 8 weeks, I contacted Expedia again and they said they would look into the matter. I was assured that the refund was processed on Nov 7, which means s%$# to me because it really should have been processed Sept 11. Today I got an email stating that they were to busy to deal with my issue in a timely manor. HELLO, this billion dollar company can't be bothered with me.  I will never use Expedia again and I will tell everyone I know not to use them. Honestly, these days Kayak has much better flights and I've been using Airbnb so I don't need Expedia.

29	"            We booked a package of Flights+hotel for 26 nights including breakfast in Cambodia 1st-27th November 2018.On 2nd November,We arrived there only to find that the hotel we booked and paid was not in business any more. It was sold and demolished.We checked into another hotel. It was so hard for us as this one did not have a restaurant as the one we booked. We tried to contact Expedia from Facebook, they insisted that we had to have a phone number for them to call us before they can assist us with anything.Eventually we found a gentleman who let us to use his phone. Expedia put us on hold forever and did not provide any help. Every one hour, the phone would cut off, due to international call, I guess. And nobody called us any more. We waited for another half an hour and had to give up.We were so disappointed and frustrated and we just wanted to come back to Australia. Eventually there was someone provided the information to change our air flights to come back to Australia the next day, but said that we had to pay to change the flights. We rejected. They still insisted that we have to have a phone number for them to call us before they can assist us with anything.On the 3rd,We had to go back to the capital city and check into another hotel to get a Cambodian sim card for Expedia to call us. Luckily they changed the flights for us to come back the next day. Expedia paid the extra to change the flights. And gave us the refund for the hotel.On the 4th, we took the plane and arrived to Australia the following day. Yesterday 7th November, we asked for a full refund from Expedia including the flights. Expedia denied us. They said that was because they paid big money to change the flights for us to return home early.Most of the so called supervisors speak so called English that we could hardly understand. And they put you on hold forever without any music. Like one of them said: ""It's all about dollars!"" I think that is Expedia's attitude, All about dollars, not service.Up to now, the hotel is still on Expedia's website.        "	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

32	            We booked a 5-nights` stay for 8 persons in single rooms on January 25th, 2018 at a hotel in Jerusalem via expedia.com and the reservation was fully confirmed and also paid for at the time. On arrival (October 23rd, 2018) the hotel did not know about us, as the reservation had not gone through. Thus we were shipped from hotel to hotel, hardly ever stayed at the same, had to share rooms and pack up most mornings, not knowing where the next night was to be spent. This caused enormous stress and totally ruined our holiday. Elderly people in the group could not go for midday rests--as they did not have any rooms and several participants simply just wanted to go home from a holiday they had been looking forward to for a very long time. On return we contacted expedia.com who tried to put the blame on the hotel and deny their own responsibility in ruining a precious tour. Their present strategy is to completely ignore all the emails we send to them.

Spoke to Expedia and they needed to speak to the hotel before they could change it. Asked about cancellation even though nothing had been paid and there was 9 months before the stay at the hotel and they will only refund 50%. They called the hotel but could not call me back for 24 hours. Overall the experience was painful and I will not use them again.        	                18	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
35	"            I booked a flight through your agency in August. I now have an issue with a family member and am unable to make the flight. I went to my email confirmation and I clicked a link to the site where I had an option to Change or Cancel my flight, it then led me to another page where I had a message that Expedia does not charge a cancellation or change fee. I called the helpline number provided and I got an AVR where I entered my itinerary number and I was given the option of cancellation and to hang up. I noticed the status of my flight had not changed so I called customer support and spoke with 3 different people who did not provide any help. They told me that they follow the guidelines of the airline company that I booked but I was explaining that it was YOUR site that caused the confusion as it gave me the option of change or cancellation which is should not have if this was the case. I spoke with Stormy from the Las Vegas Corporate office who was extremely unhelpful, condescending and rude. I explained I had a medical issue with my sister who had no one and there was no sympathy and it was as if I was talking to the AVR again. She offered no solution and had the worst attitude and just sounded emotionless and unhelpful. The previous representative I spoke with even took the time to call Austrian airlines to find me a solution and when she passed me to her so-called ""manager"", I felt like I was passed to the first tier again. There was no solution provided by Stormy, nor a follow-up, I felt like I was being pushed off the phone. I wasted 2 hours on a call to get absolutely no where and I felt horrible afterwards, if this is the kind of support given to people going through issues I will never use or promote your company to anyone.

36	            Customer service is never helpful. I have tried Expedia twice and every time I contacted customer service, they were very rude, curt and condescending. The site is not transparent and does not break down all taxes and 'fees' in your itinerary/receipt. One particular incident - I simply asked for the breakdown of the huge amount for taxes/fees when my airplane ticket was less than half of the tax/fee amount, and she was already arguing and repeatedly told me 'you should've known when you booked it! its on your receipt and your itinerary!' over and over. How was that supposed to help me? When she resent the receipt, the breakdown of costs was still was not on there and that was when I was unhappy with her curtness and arrogance, and asked if she had even looked through the receipt and itinerary before sending. She could not provide any clear answers and told me to contact the airlines. If I am booking through Expedia, should you not be more helpful, thorough or transparent? She also told me to check my banking company about the taxes/fee amount even though my banking company has nothing to do with Expedia's taxes or fees !!!This particular woman is named Nadine from Cairo, Egypt's office.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

Imagine our surprise and disappointment when we arrived and found we did not have a reservation.  When we contacted Expedia they said that the condo was cancelled because our credit card denied payment.  No word from Expedia or the credit card company that there was a problem.  My credit card company could not explain as I have an excellent payment history and pay on time.  So I will not be using Expedia again as I cannot depend on them to make the booking.

39	"            Zero stars would be the choice. I do not believe the following is an Expedia-specific problem or issue, but more probably equally applies to many if not all travel bookings resellers.  Expedia accepted a hotel booking for travel to a college town on Parents Weekend, and also a home football weekend.  The room was listed as available to book, so I did so.  I also prepaid, a half year in advance, not to take a chance on any misunderstanding or snafu given the business of the weekend in question, locally.  At the time of booking, I had plenty of hotel choices (I booked at a major chain), room choices, and choices in terms of how I booked.  Expedia had been my go-to for many such trips and I had not previously felt poorly served.  I had months, and then weeks, before the weekend in question.  I had read accounts in the Parents' Facebook group for the school in quesiton, of how certain local hotels had overbooked their rooms.  I was neither concerned nor deterred because the Expedia web site (and phone app) showed my booking as confirmed and paid.  That is, until I received an email from Expedia a mere five days before my trip, telling me that the hotel had cancelled my reservation and offering no proximal or reasonable booking option.  Customer Service was unable to help.  Apparently there is fine print in the contract between Expedia and the hotel chain (and probably all hotel chains?), that allows the hotel(s) to rent rooms to its own clients for a more premium price, regardless of whether or not Expedia (and I believe, any site like it) has made a co-called ""confirmed"" commitment to one of its clients.  In other words, it appears that when you ""book"" through Expedia or any of them, implicit in what the customer thinks is a contract is an ""...unless the hotel can otherwise sell the same room to someone else for more...""  I have been the victim of the latter.  Now unlike some of the online Expedia horror stories, I am getting my prepayment refunded in full.  Of course, I still was left without a reservation (I now have one 25 miles distant).  Expedia (and all web sites of that ilk) have lost me as a customer forever, and I have made it my mantra to use my dubious free time on social media to warn as many people as possible of this deceptive practice, so as to cost them as much business as possible.  It's a sworn civic duty.  So here I am.  Caveat emptor.  Use them as a research tool only.  Then book direct.        "	                2	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

How ridicules is that?!?!?

41	"            So I book a hotel stay with Expedia for a hotel in Saipan and pay in advance. The hotel loses power and has no water due to a typhoon striking the island. I communicate with the hotel using Expedia's web site only and have an email , on Expedia messaging tool, saying I can obtain a refund from Expedia since they cannot accomodate my stay. When I contct Expedia as the hotel told me to in order to cancel, they say they are unable to see the emails on their site and cannot provide a refund. Even after sending them a copy of the email on their website, i am told they cannot refund since ""someone"" at the hotel told them i have to arrange other dates...no refund. Bottom line, stay away from Expedia and do not bother using their messaging tool as a way to cover yourself.

All seemed good until the website says ""Unable to process your transaction, please try later"". Me thinking it maybe was my laptop browser, I used another, still same issue. Today I then used my work computer, still same issue. I must have tried more than 5 times between 2 different credit cards all the while me not knowing that each time I tried to book, this company added a pending on each transaction. Now I have over $1,100 dollars pending between my debit and discover card. I called customer service about the issues and the rep tells me that the reason I wasn't able to book is because the flight I chose was sold out! HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT! The website never alerted me of this. The rep then tells me that I can choose another flight. Now my total went from 178.00 to 325.00! I told her no thanks! I told her that this is bad for business and why should I have to pay so much more now when the issue wasn't my fault. She then tells me there is nothing she can do AND that I would have to wait at least 3 day for the pending charges on both my credit cards to revert. What a crock of s**t! Never again.

Requesting definitive clarification on Expedia's position - that I could be charged for not sounding friendly enough over the phone - I asked the following: ""they [Expedia/Ramada] are saying they will keep my money because I was rude to them?"" Expedia's customer service representative, ""Elenilson,"" responded ""that's correct Eric."" I, of course, responded with ""That is NOT legal ... You told me they could not accomodate my reservation, NOT that they could keep my money for rudeness.""I'm presently considering civil litigation against Expedia AND Ramada for punitively witholding my funds as a result of language they found disagreeable. No company may charge a fee for objectionable language. Neither is this action covered by the terms &amp; conditions of my contract to purchase, NOR is it lawful according to the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This began as a lying-about-my-refund issue, but it's turned into a breach-of-Civil-Rights issue - something I FULLY intend to pursue.*NOTE: my unfriendly attitude was a result of Ramada manager ""Arnold's"" claim that Expedia would not allow them to process a refund, contradicting Expedia's earlier claim that Expedia had, in fact, attempted to negotiate a refund for my erroroneous booking directly with Arnold beforehand, on my behalf.

I have contacted them on four separate occasions  and there is no help whatsoever. They have answered none of my questions and have tried to shift the blame to the bank.

74	            OMG...I will  start by saying, I'm not sure if it was the 3rd party reservation through Expedia or the hotel. I will say the staff was great, very nice. I drove 4 hours, got to the room and they didn't have my reservation, so my child his friend and myself had to sit out in the lobby (looking homeless) and contact Expedia. I was put on hold several times, 20 minutes or more with Expedia. After about 30-45 minutes I finally got a room. 2nd nights stay, the tub got stopped up and we had to literally pack up around midnight and move to another room. It was right next door so I was complaining as much. Got in that room and there was a big roach in the bathroom sink. I really wasn't going to write a review, but I just checked my account and they have charged me twice. This has been the worse experience. I don't know if I should never use Expedia again or if it was the hotel itself. But I will be taking this complaint as far as I can get it up the chain. This is absolutely ridiculous !!!! I give this rating no stars!!!!! I had to give it 1 star to make this post.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

I called Expedia and their customers service keep on pushing here and there. Email them also didn't settle the problem.

76	"            The ABSOLUTE WORST. Do not book with them! They made multiple errors on my flights and triple booked me for a trip, wanted to charge me twice the fee for a plane ticket change when the airline themself actually said it shouldn't cost that much, their customer service reps (as well as ""managers"") have yelled at me multiple times even though I remained polite during the entire call. What kind of customer service is that?!When I noticed a discrepancy between my flight schedules on the airline website VS expedia itinerary, I called expedia to clarify but they did absolutely nothing to help me with the situation. I called them 3 times, going back and forth between airline and expedia, and everytime, the airline confirmed my schedule noting that expedia messed up on their end, but expedia customer service kept saying they have no control over the schedule and that I need to ""shut up and listen"". They actually said that. And that came from a ""manager"". Every time I called, they would start raising their voices at me within 1 min of speaking with me, all I did was explain the situation and ask politely for them to look into correcting their schedule to match the airline's updated timing.Save yourselves the hassle, avoid expedia (or expediafortd) like the plague. They will ruin your entire vacation trip planning experience and make you go through hell of you dare to make even a tiny little change to your trip.

The flight only on Expedia website ( airAsia) shows 456$ and hotel 199$ .They offer me to combine both as  package to ( save money) . Guess what they have done . THEY BOOKED ME THE SAME FLIGHT, SAME DAY WITH CHARGE 531$ instead of 456$ for the flight + 20 $ booking + 199 $ hotel. SO they actually added 100$ extra on the package for the airline because I have used the package . I have called them in less than 20 minutes - they told me that the booking is non refundable . no cancellation.

I told the Hotel Clerk that I booked a room and paid extra for the Harbor View of the water.  She said Expedita often books you but you are not guranteed to get the type of room you book.  I begged them to please put me in a room with a view and not on the busy street.  They put me in a room on the back side of the hotel but I  had ""NO HARBOR VIEW"".

I used Expedia with AARP after swearing these firms off years ago. Sorry that I tried them again.  Things haven't gotten any better.  I cancelled a room online as they advertised that you can do so, but it didn't get cancelled. Hence, they took my money for a room I didn't even use.  Neither Expedia nor the hotel were willing to give me a refund.  No more using these kinds of firms for me.

This company is not trust worthy. They lie and they steal peoples money because they knew I could not travel on the same day to the same city departing from 2 different airports. They do NOT want to help you after the facts. They just want your money. They also like to transfer you from operator to operator to make things worst for you. I guess is a way of making you give up.

86	"            Booked a travel package of round trip airfare and rental car for a one day business trip and was quoted $256.32.  I made the purchase and received my confirmation and receipt for $256.32.  Days later, I noticed on my credit card statement that Expedia had charged me $263.13.Granted, it's only a $6.81 difference, and normally I wouldn't even notice, but since I was expensing the trip with my company, I needed everything to match up on my expense report.  I sent Expedia support an email alerting them to the difference, with a screenshot of the charge on my statement to back up my claim.  I quickly got a response, which said, ""Upon checking our records we verified that you booked a package reservation with the amount od USD 253.32 without the Insurance you purchased. The additional USD 10.00 is the additional fee for the Insurance you have purchased on Expedia.""...except there was no $253.32 anywhere on the receipt and no $263.32 charged to my card.  Clearly there was more of an issue somewhere, so I sent a screenshot of the itinerary that they sent me, which showed the the airfare, rental car and insurance policy all included in the $256.32 displayed on the receipt.They then replied, ""Based on our system, the total amount charged for your booked reservation is amounting to USD 263.13.We hope the above clarifies your query.""Well, obviously I was charged that amount, because that's what I told YOU, based on my credit card statement.  However, that is not the answer to my question.I then asked for an updated itemized receipt displaying the breakdown of the $263.13 charge, since all I had was one detailing a charge of $256.32, and the itemized receipt would fix the situation for expensing purposes.They replied that ""we are unable to provide a receipt with the breakdown of your package reservation as Expedia can only provide you a copy of your itinerary as a receipt for this type of bundle deal.If you would notice the vacation package reservation was offered at a discounted rate and that the total amount that you were offered for the vacation package did not reflect any breakdown along the booking process.The rates that we have for vacation package reservations are contracted rates with our partner vendors and we do not have a breakdown for this as it is put together by the system.Nevertheless, we have seen that the total amount you have paid for your reservation was USD 263.13.""So basically, Expedia feels that they are free to quote you whatever they want, then subsequently charge you a completely different amount, while only providing a receipt for the quoted amount.I have disputed the charge with my bank, and I will be choosing a different company for booking travel in the future.  I would highly recommend that everyone do the same.        "	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive

Most recently I booked a simple reservation at a Nevada based hotel to attend a conference. I even purchased insurance (always do just in case)... when the conference was cancelled 7 days prior to travel I went to cancel the one night hotel reservation. EXPEDIA tried to claim 'oh WE don't charge you any cancel fee BUT the hotel will not reimburse you'... I'm sorry WHAAAAT?!

My hotel cost me $356 C and the hotel will not refund Expedia. I informed Expedia that they should be refunding my hotel as I book multiple trips with them throughout the year. Expedia recused and advised me they would not be doing anything for me. I spoke to a supervisor who told me the same thing. It’s extremely unfortunate that Expedia is not ensuring my refund and the trip they booked got cancelled making it impossible for me to get to.

Reserved so that I wouldn't have to pay now and I could cancel if my partner and I decided to alter our plans. I saw the confirmation on the Expedia website but did not receive an email confirmation and haven't done since. The next day I received an email via Expedia from the Thai resort saying that I was booked in. Then the money was taken from my account. I queried with Expedia asking them where my confirmation email from them was and why had the money been taken out of my account when it was only a reservation. They responded saying that they had no record of my booking or me and they would look into it. I didn't hear back and so I asked the Thai resort what itinerary number they had for my booking. I then told Expedia what it was, plus gave them evidence of the money being removed from my account and have received several ""we are looking into it"" emails. This is unacceptable and worrying. They don't have a record of my booking, yet the resort has. Luckily it isn't a lot of money, but if we do decide to change our plans, will we be able to get a refund if they don't have a record of it and why is it taking them so long?

100	            I booked my trip 3 months ahead of time with Expedia (in March for a trip in June) for a group of 3 people. In May I decided to switch my departure date to 2 days prior to the other 2 guests. I told them to ONLY CHANGE ONE person’s departure date, but leave everything else the same and I repeated this at least 5 times.After receiving a confirmation email I felt reassured and left it. Upon arriving to the airport (the day I thought I was to leave) there was no reservation for me. Neither the airline or Expedia had my name in the system.After spending 3 hours in the airport on the phone with Expedia trying to correct this issue, first with Rebecca in customer service and then with Amari at the corporate office, I missed my flight and was blamed for the fault. They NEVER APOLOGIZED and left me on the phone while they re-listened to the original call I made to change my flight because they THOUGHT I MADE THE MISTAKE.In conclusion, we spent 10 hours on the phone had to cancel and rebook every single flight which caused us to overnight in another country and pay for a hotel and ferry we didn’t budget for. We spoke to at least 5 different people all of whom did not tell us the same answer as to what happened to the booking. We had to beg them to compensate us for the hotel and it took us A MONTH AFTER our trip to receive our REFUND from them (which took reminding and persistence).This was not worth it and I wouldn’t recommend anyone to use them and go through this same stress.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

They told me that part of the first leg had not been taken. I sent the boarding passes showing all flights were taken. Sofi asked me to wait for 24h for Iberia's authorization and somebody from Expedia would call me. Nobody called. I called and spoke with Cindy. After 1h37' she told me again about the supposedly ""non-taken"" flight. I asked to speak with her supervisor. Waited another 10 minutes and I just decided to hang-up. I called Iberia right after. They made the change I needed. Nobody told me anything about the ""non-taken"" flight, it will cost me US$ 434,00, and I spent 23 minutes with them on the phone. Honestly, it is very frustrating, and I do not see any benefits of using Expedia, as at the end the cost is not a big difference from what we can find on airlines' websites, and it is always very difficult to make changes.

Prior to our return we had arranged and received confirmation of our pick up from our hotel and subsequently awaited collection at the appropriate time ( 03:10). Unfortunately the transport did not arrive even after several attempts by the duty reception staff to contact. After waiting until 04:40 and being desperately concerned about missing our flight I felt we had no choice but to seek an alternate means of transport. Luckily for us the reception staff managed to arrange collection via a local taxi. Unfortunately for us this resulted in a considerable additional taxi fare over and above what we had paid for our travel voucher.This has been a very unpleasant and stressful experience and one that we will never undertake with expedia again.We have tried numerous times to resolve by contacting expedia via customer service e-mail and phone and it appears after 31 days of trying the insignificant customer has lost out again.In my experience if anything goes wrong you have no redress.        	                2	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

On Friday, Expedia sent me an email saying the original booked flights won't be in operation and I must change my schedule. I called them to see if there were possibilities to change. They told me I would be contacted by them and get the issue resolved. I waited for one day and get no response. Since my trip is urgently coming, I called them several times on Saturday and Sunday. They started saying it is weekend, Air France is not in operation (why?) and the issue won't be resolved till Monday. I started to send emails back to the original notification and explained how urgent it was and please get me refunded. On Monday, I received an email saying I must call them and the issue won't be resolved by emails (why?). So I called for six or seven times. They started to say there were issues between departments and they will call me back. Again nothing has happened until the end of the day. So I still have three days to go to either bet on Expedia's services after going through six phone calls, several holding-ons (10-20min waiting for each), several promises to call me back (nothing happened), several promises to wait for another couple of days (so kind), OR I need book a flight immediately by myself. I simply chose the later. Go away Expedia ever.        	                4	1	Monday	expedia	positive

Cancelled flights lead me straight to expedias phone line for a refund.. lets just say this awful team have not got a clue what's going on under their own noses. Even demanded the manager and he was just as rude as everyone else.3 weeks I waited for my holiday package refund.. 3 weeks they kept my money saying it was a 'refund system error'. I called over and over to confirm a date and every time they said 'oh looks like it hasn't gone through correctly, but I'll do this for you now'.. yeah whatever.

112	            When we checked in (at approximately 12:30am, after driving all day), we were told that some areas of the hotel and some rooms in the hotel did not have power.  We were assured that our room did have power and that power to the rest of the hotel would be restored “soon”.  It had recently rained, our room was located on the second floor and a large, deep puddle had accumulated in the area that was in front to the stairway.  When we arrived to our room with all our luggage, we learned that our room did not have power.  I spoke again with the front desk person and, after telling me that we could not change rooms to one with power, he assured me that power would be restored soon.  Throughout our entire stay, power was never restored.  There was no hot water.  The carpet in the entryway inside our room was soaked with water. We were awoken at approximately 4am by an enormous “boom” -like a cannon had just been set off- when the hotel’s underground transformer blew up and again at about 7am when a work crew began jack-hammering to dig out the blown transformer.  When the jack-hammering began, we left and asked to speak with the manager.  The front desk person explained that she was too busy dealing with the power issue to to talk with everyone.  We accepted his explanation and asked that she contact us by phone when she was able.  Weeks later, she still had not called.  So my wife called and left her a voicemail in which she requested that she call us.  By a week after that, we still did not receive her call.  My wife called again and was able to speak with the manager, Becky Hunt.  Becky said that she didn't realize we wanted for her to call us back.  -Uh, yes, actually we did want you to call us, that's why we left the message for you to call us when we checked out of the hotel and also when she left you a voicemail in which she asked you to return her call; not sure how you could not understand that.  After my wife described the many issues with the conditions during our stay, Becky assured my wife that she would refund our money.  She said it would be faster if we contacted Expedia for the refund because they are the third party who processed our payment.  We contacted Expedia who, in turn said that they would need to contact Becky to confirm the refund.  After contacting Becky, Expedia stated that Becky was denying our request for a refund.  I responded to Expedia, suggesting that they may wish to again contact Becky regarding our experience at her hotel because she 'must' have 'forgotten' about her discussion with my wife in which she had already agreed to a refund.  I also informed Expedia that I would be disputing the charge with my credit card company and contacting the Motel 6 corporate office.  I have not yet received a response from Expedia (I will update this review if/when I receive one).  I have placed the charge into dispute with my credit card company and shared all my experience with the Motel 6 corporate office (which seemed supportive).  I will update this review if/when I receive a final resolution from the Motel 6 corporate office.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	positive

120	            Expedia protects their clients, but do not protect their users. As such, I will no longer being using Expedia for my travel plans. 15 yrs of using Expedia booking International flights I've never had to pay for luggage. As such I had to pay $300+ upon my departure/return. There was nothing written on Expedia explaining or including that in their booking. This would have made a difference in our trip knowing that we would have been paying a round trip ticket for our luggage. They took no responsibility and/or interest, blaming the airline for this rather than acknowledging that this wasn't written anywhere in the booking at the time.  Do they think that travel doesn't include luggage? Instead they said they just book tickets. They book travel and travel usually means bringing things along to accommodate your stay.They just lost a long valuable customer and they didn't seem to blink knowing.        	                3	1	Friday	expedia	negative

123	            Terrible customer service!An automated email was sent to me by Expedia after I had to cancel my flight due to a funeral. The email stated that the Alitalia airline was giving us some credits to book other flights within one year. The amount would have been the original amount minus something for cancellation fees.Expedia asked me multiple time to provide a screenshot of the same email which I did. The email is a genuine email from expediamail.com not a scam! Surely Expedia should be able to trace this information on its own other than having to ask it to the client! Long story short Expedia appear not be willing either refund our tickets or grant us credits for the amount of 2277.30USD. as stated in their email!!        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive
124	            Beware of using Expedia. I booked some flights from Singapore to Malaga (Via the UK) for my wedding. I am meant to fly in a few weeks so was checking at my flights and only now realized that there is only 3.5 between my connecting flights in the UK. Trouble is that I land in Heathrow but my next flight leaves from Gatwick. So there is not enough time to switch airports and also comes at a huge cost. I called Expedia to ask for help and to maybe change to a later connecting flight and they want to charge me over £1000 to change or £500 if I just cancel that leg and re-book a separate much cheaper flight direct with BA. I checked the cost of the flight on BA and it was only £141 so Expedia are taking advantage of my desperate situation and holding me hostage to the fact I booked through them. The attitude of the agent was that I should have read the small print and when I expressed my dissatisfaction, he just hung up on me. I really do hope that someone reads this and it saves them from making the same mistake. Expedia do not care about customers.        	                7	1	Monday	expedia	negative
125	            Expedia claim to provide an aggregation service (for price comparison) however their hidden fees mean this service lacks credibility. I recently used them for a flight booking for my family but ended up paying £160+ on additional fees. The response from Expedia was to point me to some small print. In my view, when you are booking flights you expect luggage allowances to be included or an the option to include this during the comparison. Avoid. There are better companies in this space now.        	                2	1	Monday	expedia	neutral

I have no kind words for Avis in France either. They refused to accept the Expedia price and charged more as well.Uodate: our credit card company listened to our story and withheld payments to Avis and Expedia.

They said “I should have called them to make sure breakfast was included”, as if they had stated that before I paid, as if they had sent an email letting me know, which I made sure before I even paid, that breakfast was included. I spoke to both the service agent and the manger and both didn’t understand how to fix this issue, even though there online system was the problem and I made sure I had breakfast included else I wouldn’t have never booked through expedia or this hotel. I shouldn’t have this problem after the fact, can’t even enjoy my morning because I have to deal with this company that doesn’t know how to run there systems or train or teach there employs how to solve these issues.

133	            We booked two rooms last minute late at night using a tablet, the next morning the accommodation provider called me with one question: what time we would be arriving. I told her we were driving all day and would arrive late that night. She then informed me it would not be possible, that their policy was no check-ins after 7:00PM, and that the only way I could try to get my $ back was to call Expedia! So...they called me within 9 hours of booking, they knew the only action was to go to Expedia, and it turns out they also knew that they had taken my money directly...not Expedia. They were in control of the funds, had a policy published somewhere, and had CLEARLY had this conversation a lot...and were profiting from the situation.Expedia's customer service was very polite and helpful initially when I called to cancel our booking less than 12 hours after making it. They called the provider, then told me all was taken care of and no fees would be charged.But they turned out to be completely worthless and ineffective after all. After we were back home, the room charge appeared on my card. After calling Expedia again, they contacted the provider and wrote me an email saying that my request for a refund had been denied...AFTER THEY HAD ALREADY TOLD ME THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK!!! There is simply no way this is an isolated incident, and if Expedia cared for its customers rather than the providers on its site, they could very easily track how much money providers are making by tactics like this...but they chose not to.I'll be sticking with my direct Marriott and similar bookings in the future, and with my (only slightly better) booking.com provider going forward.        	                4	1	Friday	expedia	positive

137	            We purchased a return ticket from Toronto to Rome with hotel bookings in Rome. We purchased an insurance with it which clearly said it covers travel charge reimbursement. However when I called Expedia customer care, they said they cannot reimburse my airline penalty fees. The site said airline penalty fees range from $ 150 to 200 per person but customer service claimed it will be $ 300 per person. The lady on the other side kept telling me random things that are apparently in the insurance fine print.The horrible customer service rep could not even cancel my hotel reservation although I called more than 1 month before the start of the trip. She kept saying that they will call the hotel and cannot do anything about the cancellation fees. The horrible service and complete disregard for the insurance I have purchased on their own site was frustrating. They sell insurance on their site but refuse to process the insurance claims. It is frustrating that a company like Expedia will provide such terrible service. If they cannot resolve this issue, I am never ever going back to Expedia for anything anymore.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative
138	"            What I really mean is 0 stars. Expedia.ca's Price Match guarantee is so ridiculously limited that it should not be named a guarantee - just a marketing gimmick.  You need ONE screenshot of their competitor's website to show price, details of the room you book, full price, and number of passengers, along with bunch of other information they list.  But all within ONLY one screenshot.  One of their biggest competitors is priceline and they know for a fact that priceline does not list all this information in their final screenshot of the booking.  So you would need more than one picture to support your price match claim.  But guess what? They won't let you submit more that one picture as a follow up to your Claim for pricematch, because you are only allowed to send one request and one picture and you won't be given a chance to send more pictures to support your claim. I walked ""Dean"" the Manager through their competitor's website and explained to him what they are asking for is not possible at all.  But his response was how our competitor's do their websites is not our responsibility.  Really?? Does this look like a legitimate pricematch practice to you? To me, it's false advertising and borderline fraud.  I waited 1.5 hour to speak to the manager and he took no ownership.  You came up with these ridiculous rules for your so called ""price match"" guarantee but you design it in a way so your customers can't ever benefit from it especially since one of your biggest competitors is priceline.  Nothing is more disappointing that companies thinking their customers are stupid and they can outsmart them. You deserve to be sued Expedia. And your customer service is nothing but disappointing. When I told ""Dean"" the manager I will go public with your misleading policy, he said ""go for it"".

I end up cancelling my trip to florida on Sept 07 (after trying to reach them for 22 hours ) I cancelled due to the fact that disney land was going to be closed due to hurrican Irmaso I was assured  I wasnt going to be charged any cancellation fee and  would be able to book a trip with in the year with the same airline.  The cancellation  email , however started there would be so after trying to reach them for 4 hours , I was told that was the standard letter format and there was a note on my account mentioning the circumstances  under which I cancelled. when I tried rebooking, of course they saw no note , so after a 4 hour call , speaking to customer service  / the supervisor  and air canada I was allowed to book with a penalty of 200 ,again I argued for an hour and was finally understood ,  my mistake was that i told them  I would confirm the date after spaking to work.  Next call made , again no notes - and this time the supervisor said my time was up .. where as I had a month still anyways after 3 hours I was told she would go through all the recordings ( accusing me of making the whole story up) when I said surely go ahead, she said she would put me through to the corporate office . I felt like wheater I was speaking to customer  a supervisor  or to someone in the corporate  office , everyone lacked knowledge and said something totally different  than the other. anyways long story short after 4 hours I was t allowed to book despite me having time left and I was given a refund with the penalty of 400 deducted , so basically I got 300 dollars back absolutely  not happy and  unsatisfied most horrible experience  ever.

150	"            I have never faced such an improper way of treating passengers!I'm staying in KSA and my Family staying in Jordan, we planned to spend Eid Holiday in Istanbul together, I booked their round-trip tickets from Amman / Jordan to Istanbul Departing on August 17, 2018 returns in August 24, 2018 in order to arrange my flight accordingly and then reserve a car and make a hotel booking as well, I received a confirmation email from Expedia then I did executed my plan.The flight ticket for me from KSA / Manama to Istanbul was very expensive so I reserved a non-refundable ticket to save some money Finally it cost me $891 then I proceeded with car and hotel reservation which was as well non-refundable.I have done my 5 family members reservations paying the total amount of $1088 and received the confirmation from Expedia and the airlines on August 3, 2018, It is high season these days and prices increase every minute.August 7, 2018, I received an email from the airlines for each of the confirmed 5 tickets for my family mentioning simply that tickets for these flights are not valid any more due to computer bug!!! I tried immediately to contact the airlines call centre but they were not answering!!!Since I have done the full process through Expedia I contacted their call centre which is located in the US discovering that they have no idea about this!!! the first answer was that the partnership between the airlines and the operator was terminated which obviously not my problem then I spend 2 days between the agents and supervisors, each time I call they wanted me to explain the whole story leaving me long time on hold to contact the airlines instead of closing the line and call me back! they want to save calling expenses obviously!!In addition, I got promises not to worry and that they will find a solution and at the end when I notice that they are not making any reasonable action as expected, I asked them to connect me with a higher authority in Expedia that may solve my problem, in order to connect me through with the corporate manager they kept me on hold for around 20 minutes and I was waiting despite that I'm spending too much on calling them internationally but I was also hoping that this might solve my problem.I was really disappointed when the corporate manager confirmed that the trip is cancelled and that they started already the refunding process and they can’t do anything about it!!! even I asked her to assist me to get a refund of the other ticket that I reserve for my self from Manama to Istanbul but she confirmed that the only thing she can do is to help me find another booking and can't be involved in any extra cost!! while I can do this my self online without any help. I tried to find another flight but the price become more than triple. So, I had 2 options: either I cancel the whole plan and lose my non-refundable ticket $891 + Non-refundable Hotel’s reservation $853 + my calls to Expedia call centre $133  = $1877 or to reserve expensive tickets for my family and lose almost the same amount.I have made a good plan from the beginning without mistakes, why should I lose this amount of money?!!Expedia Corporate Manager statement was "" we don't own plans and we can't make it up, this is airline issue and we are the third party"" I don't believe in the above statement, however, I do believe that I made the deal through Expedia and has no contact with the Airlines, Expedia MUST NOT deny their responsibility.

The agent asked me to not worry after speaking with Sixt and told me I would get a full refund in 7 days. I left and when I get to the hotel I receive an email saying they can not refund me because sixt does not want to. Your stupid agent told me to leave. If your agent would have told me that I could not get a refund I would have taken your Volvo even thought I paid for Mercedez.

They said I would need to dispute this charge with Expedia as they had made the error.It has been almost a month now that I have been trying to secure this refund and all throughout this time the customer service experience has been woeful. Terrible. Spectacularly bad (I could go on). I have received 3 emails from customer service, been on the phone 5-6 times (including one where I was on hold for over 45 minutes, trying to reach a Manager). I was told twice that they would call me back ""within the hour"". The first time I received no call back. The first part of delivering good customer service is taking ownership of when things go wrong and not once has Expedia done that. It's clear to me that this company doesn't not care about or prioritise its customers. I will now choose one of the many other online travel companies to book rental cars.

155	"            Dreadful customer service. We had a terrible experience at one of their highly rated hotels (very very dirty hotel) and I lodged a complaint with them. Long story short, they closed my case without consulting me. One of their agents rang me to say that ""they were investigating my case, and as a good will gesture, they would add a  £50 voucher in my account, would that be OK?"" to which  I said thanks and asked them when they would let me know about the outcome of my case. The man on the phone said someone would be in touch with me. More than 10 days passed and when I rang them, they told me that since I accepted the £50, I had accepted the case me closed. The man lied in his notes. Anyway, in the end they gave me a total of three different vouchers, did not get in touch with the hotel. Now it turns out that I can only use one voucher per booking. I was told that I could use all three in a booking. Basically, if you book something with them, don't expect any customer service. Avoid them and go with other booking companies.

He called and got it successfully changed and proceeded to try to check in again. This time when he tried to check in the reservation said collect payment from guest, but he had prepaid 170$ already and it was taken out of his account. He called Expedia back and after 3 hours of arguing with the SUPERVISOR he received a fax at the hotel that the agent cancelled his very first reservation and collected payment from him. The supervisor still said that he could not receive a refund even with the proof right in front of him that he had paid because on “her end” it wasn’t showing payment.

They will offer you credit that has an expiration date and can only be used with several restriction. Their goal is to make sure you will not use the voucher at your time and they will not ""lose"" money.They took most of my sanity this summer (so did hotels.com) with all their reimbursement with coupons that don't cover what i originally paid for.Very disappointing!

Despite repeated requests they would not tell me the problem. I finally got an email where they not only said said they wouuldn't help me any further, but I wouldn't be allowed to make reservations on their site.

For the first time in 5 years Expedia refused to pay my cash back even though I was able to prove that once again I went through the quidco website. The excuses were appalling. 1)They are not affiliated with quidco (even though I had been receiving the cash back via quidco for the last 5 years and even though they advertise on quidco (cash back provider) and you use the link to book)2)Quidco would have to pay me , they won't. Even though quidco explained that Expedia always pay them and quidco then pay me.The weakest excuses ever. I have been a loyal customer for 5 years and I have spent 1000's with Expedia, but there is not accounting for the recognition of loyalty and quality customer service (unskilled staff).

We arrived at our hotel in the dark in snow chains after driving through the worst snow conditions France has seen for many years with our 3 small children to find Expedia had not booked the hotel it had sent us a confirmed booking reference for.   The hotel told us it had happened before with Expedia and did nothing to help us.   After being on the phone for 3 hours in the car Expedia could only find a hotel over New Year miles away/   Expedia would only reimburse us Expedia points so I could not pay for another hotel.

185	            On 17 JUN 2018, I selected a bundled (flight, hotel, and rental car) vacation to Iceland from 24-31 AUG 2018. Note lodging and car rental would begin on 25 AUG. Initial quote was around $1600, upgraded hotel room to about $99/night, as I recall, and added both trip and car insurance. Believe the total was between $1800 and $2000. When I received my bank statement, it said that $2098.76 was charged on 17 JUN and posted on 18 JUN. Then on 21 JUN a charge for $346.91 was posted as paid to Iceland Air. Contacted expedia and inquired what was going on? $2095 meant I was paying almost $200 a night in the hotel since car rental was $400-$500. Told them I felt like I had been doubled bill. Further, their bill on my expedia account did not match what my card was charged. According to expedia, the trip was billed as a subtotal of $2062.14 with $383.53 in taxes and fees. Customer service rep had limited English skill and said she would forward it to her supervisors for review. Here is the equally awkward email sent to me on 15 JUL.

When I got to them motel at 10 PM, I was told that the motel was completely booked and I was told to get with expedia to resolve the issue. I ended up finding a room at another room in the area and called expedia after vacation to get refund for a room I never stayed in. I was told by customer representative that they can't give me a refund and I would have to ask for refund to the motel.  Essentially, both parties pointed fingers at each other and didn't take into consideration the customer AT ALL. The worse part of this experience was not getting the well deserved refund but being lost as a solo female traveler in a new city late at night. I felt extremely unsafe and decided to never use their service again.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	neutral

188	            We booked dates through them, but we were not sure if my husband was actually going to have those dates off from work.  Therefore, we called their customer service and explained to them that we may need to cancel the flight or change the dates as we did not yet have my husband's work schedule.  We were advised to purchase insurance which would allow us to cancel at no cost.  We bought the insurance for all three of us traveling (at a cost of $164).  Today, we got my husband's schedule so we called to change/or cancel the flight to a day earlier.  We first wanted to cancel because we found a better flight path with just one layover as opposed to 2, but they told us we can only cancel in the event of death or illness.  So, we asked them to move the day up by one day to add an extra day for our vacation.  To this, we were told that, after change fees, etc., that it would be an additional $3000 (this is in addition to the original $2500).  Bottom line, they are very misleading.  Had my husband ended up not getting the days off, we would have been out the $2500.  Please do not forget that we DID call them prior to purchasing the tickets and THEY are the ones who advised us to purchase the insurance.

I asked for a supervisor who told me it was a software glitch relative to the confirmation, but she declined to confirm the King Room for me at the rate quoted on the Expedia site.

190	            Booked a flt and car rental w/cancellation insurance. 2 minutes later, I found that I had to change things, so I cancelled. Later had trouble getting the site to cooperate, so I rebooked via Orbitz. My email showed the car rental cancelled, but the flt had not. I went back into the site, and was directed to the airline (FRONTIER). Their phone system was all but non-responsive, and kept putting me over to an auto booking system to buy additional tickets. Called Expedia, and the lady cancelled my c=trip cancellation insurance but the flt charges are still there and now I cant cancel and only be out the insurance. She did that, after I specifically told her NOT to cancel the trip cancellation insurance until after the flt had been successfully cancelled. Filed a dispute with my CC company.

It showed a charge for the room on 7/2/2018.I called Expedia, and explained what happened.  The CSR's (located who knows where) first question was ""did you receive a cancellation confirmation email"".  I said that I did not.  He said without the confirmation email they couldn't process the refund.  I again explained how I'd received confirmation on their website.  Again with the no cancel confirmation email, no refund.I told him if they did not give me a refund, I'd spend the rest of the day reporting this incident on every Expedia review website I could find.  He said let me talk to my supervisor, and left me on hold for 43 minutes.  Obviously hoping I'd hang up.He came back on and just kept repeating no email, no refund.

We spent hours on the phone with Expedia and they found us a cheesy hotel in roughly the same area of town, but it ruined our trip.  I believe in second chances, so I tried them again. Made a reservation and a conflict came up that required us to push it out 1 week.  Same room, same hotel, no special events.  When they rebooked it, they charged us almost $100 more!

I canceled because the place we were going wasn't safe. When I canceled, I was told I can use my voucher for anything as long as it was with my airline; Delta. I went to go book a new bundle and was told that I cannot use my voucher towards a bundle. So the bundle deal before my voucher was $1,800. I have to do everything separate because you can't use voucher towards bundle deal so just for hotel my new cost is $2,100. HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?????? I asked for fine print that says I can't use my voucher towards the new flight in the bundle deal and the supervisor says its not their policy its the flight. She continues on and says its Expedia's policy. I again ask for the fine print. She types up an email. I asked again ""Where is it in the terms and conditions?"" Again, I asked the supervisor this. She says and I quote ""It is not in the terms and conditions."" THEN HOW IS THIS ALLOWED!!! I understand I can't use the voucher towards the hotel portion of the bundle deal. But why can't I use the voucher towards the flight portion of the bundle deal???? NO SENSE!!!!!! My questions were not answered. I will NEVER EVER use Expedia again.

201	            I don't understand what have happened to Expedia. I used to recommended to everyone with no doubts. But currently they are the company with the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.They have done 3 simple things in only one trip:1- Change the date of the flight, and were not able to contact me, they excuse themselves saying they sent an email (which I suppose arrived to junk), since I never saw it. Imagine you arrive to airport at 2 AM, and there you are told your flight was 16 hours ago.... after you and others were driving for hours to arrive there.2- You have purchased a superior boarding pass in order to transport enough check in luggage, and they tell you is not like that even when you show them some proof. At the end I paid them because only few hours before the flight. In the meantime, I contacted JetBlue, and they said expedia is not suppose to be selling this kind of plan to users, so I noticed they are using fake advertising.3- Best customer's refund policies: I had to waste several hours calling to a non toll free line, and the only result at the end was purchase AGAIN the checked luggage, and also being in a hurry because the flight was changed with no notification resulting on higher cost of transportation accommodations, everybody had to ask to require a permission at work, and leave whatever was doing, because we knew the time was change when we called to do a question about the luggage, not because they proactively told us . Anyone would be expecting some kind of refund, but we only have a bad taste.It is not the first time they fail to me or to known people, but I can tell you it will be the last.My advice to you is before using their services, take few minutes to search in internet and you will notice how had they have become.Regards,RE        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

208	            I booked Air Astana flights with Expedia.fr as they offered me a very good deal for the itinerary I wanted which included different outbound and inbound flights. I usually prefer to book directly with the airline, in order to avoid any inconveniences and manage my booking easier in case of some changes. Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened - Air Astana cancelled my inbound flight and modified my booking by replacing my original inbound flight with another flight, a 30+ hours earlier one than the flight I actually booked. I called Expedia immediately upon the receipt of the modification as the modification didn't work for me at all and they immediately took care of my case. The call was very pleasant and the lady was very kind and understanding and everything ended well for me.

211	            We booked through Expedia for 2 rooms tonight, 6/23/18-6/24/18, at 500 Diemer Dr, Mt. Laurel, NJ 08054. I received the confirmation email, number, etc. After a 3 hour drive with 3 young children, we get to our hotel around 9pm. As we wait for 30 minutes because there was no one at the desk, we are standing in line behind multiple people already complaining about not having towels, having to wait for their room for 40 mins when it was already 6pm and check in is at 3pm and a plethora of other issues. We wanted to leave at that point bc we were so tired of waiting to get checked in and our 3children were beyond tired as well but we decided to stay.Then as we were about to leave someone walks around the corner very flustered. We only decided to stay bc we were all so extremely exhausted. Finally it’s our turn to check in. The front desk stated that the hotel is full and our TWO rooms were given away. WHAT?! We booked, gave our credit number and our rooms were given away?! Unreal. Hotel said there was nothing that could be done. We then call Expedia and explain what had happened. After being on the phone with Expedia for 2 HOURS total, WE ended up finding our family a hotel 30 mins away from our original destination, in the city, bc all the hotels in the area are booked for sports tournaments. Expedia couldn’t even find us a hotel that was nearby! We had to do all the work! We tell the Expedia rep on the phone we found a hotel and please call and book for us. She puts us on hold. Comes back 30 mins later, after we just took the chance and drove the 30 mins to the hotel instead of just waiting in the extended stay parking lot any longer, she says “ok they only have ONE room avail.” Well that would be great if we weren’t a family of FIVE. I’m not having my children sleep on the floor. And thats funny bc we just called while we were waiting on hold from the other phone and were able to book TWO rooms. Hmmmm. Not well played Expedia, don’t LIE to exhausted parents, children and most importantly customers. Move ahead another 15 minutes and the Expedia rep says “how do you want to pay for the 2 rooms?” Ummmmmm excuse me? You think we are paying for this? It’s now almost MIDNIGHT and our youngest is 2 years old and he will be awake at 6:00am. Then we are told that this hotel is “much more expensive than the other hotel,” so we need to pay. Omg seriously?!?! We we’re so close to just driving home 3 hours away round trip after picking up our dog from the sitter and canceling our vacation bc we couldn’t find a place to stay and you expect us to pay anything?! Fast forward, bc I can’t keep my eyes open (and our two year old will be up at 6am), we book and pay for the rooms at this point, along with the $59 valet charge, bc we just want to go to sleep and put our kids to bed. The Expedia lady says “you pay the original charge on your 2 rooms for extended stay and we will pay the rest.” Well what about the 3 extra hours we spent in the car, our exhausted children, the work WE had to do to find a hotel? My hourly rate (calculated by my salary) is $60 an hour and my significant other’s rate of $447 an hour for doing the work ourselves x 3 hours each....You do the math on what we should charge Expedia and extended stay. We are sooooo beyond livid and disgusted with Expedia and extended stay. Wehave NEVER had an experience like this and we travel A LOT. We will NEVER use Expedia or extended stay EVER again and surely will let everyone know about the AWFUL experience as well as the UNREAL AND AWFUL customer service both companies displayed.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative

217	"            Very dodgy, dodgy...After spending days traversing the various sites to find an affordable flight to a Caribbean destination, I saw what I thought was quite affordable being offered by Expedia. The only drawback, the flight was not direct but involved connecting flights. I thought that because of the savings it was worth the inconvenience.I booked this flight in January, the flights to be in July. I kept checking my itinerary from time to time as the months passed. I remembered checking it in early April and everything seemed okay then but when I checked in late April I noticed my itinerary was changed. My original flight detail was - departing from London to Canada; then from Canada to my final destination, with an hour and a half waiting time between arriving in Canada and leaving on the connecting flight out. The itinerary was changed to - believe it or not- to arriving in Canada over an hour after my connecting flight departs. How is it possible for anyone to do that. I immediately called Expedia and inquired about it and was promptly told that the change was done by the airline, which they were entitled to do. I was left totally flabbergasted. How can anyone, with even an ounce of common sense do something like this. And to make matters worse, after chasing Expedia for days, they offered me another connecting flight with an 8 hours waiting time between connection, without any form of compensation for my inconvenience.I declined the offer and had to buy another more expensive flight but surprise, surprise during my search I saw where Expedia and Air Canada was offering my original trip with the identical itinerary (ie same dates, same connection, same flight number, etc) for a much higher fare. IF EXPEDIA OR AIR CANADA WAS REALLY GENUINE ABOUT THEIR CONCERN ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS/PASSENGERS WHY WAS I NOT OFFERED ONE OF THESE TRIPS. PROFITS PLACED AHEAD OF CUSTOMERS...THAT'S WHY.They are proper ""dodgy"" people. There must be some Consumer body to protect the rights of consumers, these people are getting away with what the common man would be ""brought to book"" for.Can you imagine. me getting into a contract with another party, the other party commits financially to it, then when I am to perform my end of the contract I renege. I would be sued for breach of contract. I think the same should apply to Expedia and Airlines that take people's money for a trip and then change it at the last minute at a terrible financial consequence to the passenger.It is downright dishonesty.

We used expedia to get our tickets at half the price form what the other sites had listed. we thought we had just scored, but when my girl friend filled out all our information she got an error message. She tried again, got the same message, and then switched which computer she was using. she got the same error message on the new computer. after getting this error message 4 times she decided to check her bank account to discover that they had placed a hold on her account for our two tickets 4 times despite the fact that we still did not have tickets. we called their customer service and the first man we spoke with just babbled at us on repeat until we asked for a suporvisor. the suporvisor asked a lot of pointed questions that really made it sound like it was our fault. one of her examples was that we made another purchase today and thats why were were missing $1500. once we finally proved to her that it was expedia that had over charged us she assured us it wasnt possible and that she could help. she asked to make the reservation again and we told her that there was no more money on the card and we didnt have another way to pay. regardless of our pleas the suporvisor set up our reservation a 5th time and when she was done the suporvisor recived the same error message my girlfriend had gotten. we checker her bank account and sure enough we were charged a 5th time. the suporvisor assured us all the charges would fall off by midnight. that was two days ago. yesterday we woke up to an email from expedia that apologized for the technical issues they were experiencing but the money was still on hold. today we woke up to discover that we did not get our money back and instead of the charges pending they have now gone through. expedia charged us over 1500 on tickets we didnt end up even getting. They assured us we would have our money back, but they took it. we called their customer service this morning but yet again they were useless and made it sound like it was our fault they took the money from us.

I then went to the insurance company and they want a copy of my medical records and a form from my doctor telling them I cannot travel!  They want to make it as difficult for you as possible! This is pure BS!  I will never use Expedia again!        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative
223	            Expedia states that they GUARANTEE you the lowest price.  They only pay hotels the lower price but charge you higher rates.  I have proof of this.   Disception at it's finest.  We paid $50 over the room rate that our hotel charged and when I called to question it was told that it was the fee that Expedia charges for their service.  I was told I should have called the hotel direct if I wanted their price.  SOOOO  there ARE hidden service fees that are not being disclosed.  Need to shut them down.  We will never use Expedia.com again!        	                2	1	Monday	expedia	negative
224	            Expedia are liars and their website is, in my opinion, fraudulent. They advertise Reward Points that you can earn to use towards future trips.  I have booked 3 trips through them over the past of years as they had previously seemed alright and earned £20 of points. However, when I tried to redeem the points when booking my last trip I was not given the option to do so.  I contacted their 'Customer Support' via their website and explained that I had been unable to redeem the points whilst making my booking because I wasn't given the appropriate option to do so.  I was told they would refund the points to the card that I booked the trip with and this would take up to 7 days.  7 days came and went but I did not receive the refund.  I contacted them again and was told that due to a technical error the points had not been refunded to my card.  I was assured that they had now refunded the points to my card but this would take 7 days.  Yet again I waited over a week and nothing.  They should not be promising their customers Points when they do not allow you to use them.  This is fraud. I have never been refused redeeming points in say Sainsburys or Boots.  Expedia are liars. They say they take customer complaints seriously on their website - what a joke!  There are plenty of other online travel companies and I will using one of them in future.        	                2	1	Saturday	expedia	negative
225	"            Expedia - I am EXTREMELY disappointed and appalled with your customer service. Not only am I dealing with one issue, I am dealing with two. First, I cancelled a flight in your ""24 hour cancellation window."" My credit card was charged, and after waiting 3 MONTHS for a refund and not receiving anything, I emailed customer service. The only help they give is ""... We recommend you to contact your bank directly to verify the status of the charge...If [you have been charged], the authorization on your account will be removed within  two to three working days. If it is more than three days, you need to contact your bank to find out about the status of the refund.""First of all, my bank isn't responsibly for giving me a refund, EXPEDIA is. Second situation: I arrive to DMK airport in Bangkok after booking a flight through Expedia to Chiang Mai, Thailand. My itinerary is listed as Bangkok DMK airport (there are two in the city). I arrive to the airport and lo and behold, I am at the wrong airport and my flight is actually at SVK. I was told the wrong information by Expedia and had to buy a more expensive ticket at the airport using a different airline. I emailed Expedia customer service about this and  they tell me I am supposed to be refunded in 3 business days. This was around 4 weeks ago and I have not received any refund. I emailed Expedia again and I get the same type of email: contact your bank to ""verify the status of the charge.. if you have been charged, contact your bank.""I am completely frustrated and will literally never use Expedia to book anything in the future. Your cancellation/refund policy is 100% UNRELIABLE. Please everyone avoid using Expedia no matter how ""simply"" it may seem - you may NEVER get a refund or your money back if you cancel a flight.        "	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

229	            Expedia's tag line 'Your booking is verified with the property, no need to call' is entirely a fake statement.

Hotel said they had cancelled my booking without any reason. I called up Expedia who has no clue. I requested for alternate hotel arrangement  but Expedia did not arrange but gave a false assurance.I had to cancel my family trip as I could not get any other hotel in this peak season.Do check up with the hotel for confirmation.

230	"            They've been OK for the past 5 years.  But this year I booked 5 nights hotel stay in Boston.  Advertised rate was on sale at $211 per night from the hotel and sale ""ends in 24 hours"".  I immediately booked the hotel but did not pay attention until a couple of days later that i realized I was overcharged for the hotel.  5x$211= $1055 + $76 trip insurance = $1131.  But I was charged, ready?, $1474.  OVER $300 MORE.  I called Expedia and their response was the advertised rate was based on room availability.  But I booked right away, when the rate was still displayed $211/night.  In conclusion, EXPEDIA LIED and ENTICED YOU INTO BOOKING THEN RIP YOU OFF AT THE LAST MINUTE.  Not only that, there reward is cheap.  All that bookings I've had with them just with the last year would have earned me at least $20 conservatiely &amp; nicely speaking.

I am a female pregnant veteran and felt like no one wanted to deal with my issues and my space was far above and beyond invades! I provided a doctors not but they wanted further details from my doctors office and wanted my doctor to release my medical conditions to them! Why do I need to explain myself or have my privacy invaded to get my money back when I paid for insurance!!! This is the far most jacked up travel agency and to deal with a third party and have to provide all this proof is a bunch of BS to me!

236	            Booked ticket in December. Airline contacted Expedia in FEBRUARY. We got a itinerary reminder two days ago. No change at all. Get to the airport. Get our tickets. Go through security. Get to our gate. No plane. Look it up, plane is scheduled for 12 HOURS after the time we were emailed. We contact Expedia and they say our airline hadn't contacted them until a week ago (which doesn't explain why we got the email claiming the same). And they keep blaming the airline for the issue when it's not the airline's fault.So now we are stuck waiting at the airport for 12 hours or we go home and do all thw security  rigamarole again. We do have a flight (technically) but the utter and complete lack of communication is not okay. My husband is paid hourly and losing 2 whole days of work, I'm salaried, but also missing 2 days of work, we don't get to help with my brother in law's wedding, and we paid for an extra 2 days of boarding for our dog. This is a serious infraction and needs to be dealt with. Our airline comped us (and we didn't really want them too, it's not their fault) and we want them to pay for either a transferred flight or (begrudgingly) just a comped ticket. After talking on the phone with them for FOUR HOURS, they are still unwilling to give us any sort of compensation, and are continuing to blame the airline for the miscommunication. Don't ever book with Expedia. In my opinion, they are liars, crooks, and cheats who don't care about customers.Edit: Expedia finally admitted their fault when we got proof from the airline that expedia never forwarded our email. We were given the choicee of a $200 voucher for a hotel booked with Expedia (yippee) or $100 flat and they'd try to get a refund from the airline. We chose the voucher, because the airline shouldn't be held responsible for their inadequacies.

237	            Pity I cant give a 0 star rating.My 3 small children, wife and I were stuck in Amsterdam after booking flights from there to Krakow. The Expedia booking specifically stated the flights were Economy/Coach which has a baggage allowance, while Economy Lite does not have a baggage allowance. Once checked in we found that we were booked Economy Lite with no baggage. We attempted to contact Expedia to attach a baggage fee which would have been cheaper but got mucked about so much we had to buy over the counter baggage which was exorbitantly expensive by five bags. We were lucky the carrier's personnel were helpful (one child is disabled &amp; required some help - thanks again Lufthansa staff)To top this off the complaints process has taken five months of calls &amp; emails &amp; they've now stated my claim is bogus - despite sending in proof of the discrepancy.If you're travelling with children do not use Expedia. Use it as a search engine then book through a carrier directly, it'll be cheaper &amp; they have a complaints process.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	positive

I pay for this hotel, then at 5:30 am I receive an email telling me that they cant give me the hotel for the price and if I don't contact and agree to pay 581 a night they will cancel my reservation, the hotel then canceled my reservation without my consent. So, I contacted Expedia before doing anything as I paid them.  They tell me it was all full and that's why it was cancelled, mentioning nothing about the email. Then when I told her that is not at all what the message said she lied again and  told me that their system was delayed. She then said she would help me find a new reservation, I ask how am I sure this will not happen again, she proceed to tell me this never happens. They just continued to lie, it is completely unacceptable and I will never trust them with my money or reservations again.

245	"            I guess I got lucky the first few times I used Expedia but yesterday I found out something I didn't know - the hard way.  Apparently booking a specific hotel room only guarantees you a room, not the only you booked, paid for and is noted on your sales confirmation.  The King room I paid for was not available upon check-in because the hotel was at full capacity.  Upon check-in, we were told that our only option was to take a room with two double beds instead of the King we booked.  In the middle of a tornado in a town that had only one other hotel, we had no choice but to stay.  NOWHERE ON OUR CONFIRMATION DOES IT SAY THAT IF THE ROOM TYPE BOOKED IS UNAVAILABLE, THAT YOU WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO STAY IN AN ALTERNATE ROOM TYPE.  The hotel itself is not accommodating because, let's face it, they want you to book directly through them and not use a third party.  That's to be expected.  But Expedia customer service was AWFUL.  All we got from six agents was the standard ""I understand your frustration"" remark (which clearly they did not!!!) and one of the six offered us an insulting $25 voucher (to be applied towards another disappointing purchase???).  Upon FINALLY getting a Supervisor on the phone three hours later (literally), the response was rude and condescending, which included her remark about ""not caring if we used Expedia again.""  No financial restitution was offered for ruining our overnight stay or in an attempt to keep a repeat customer, in fact that, a customer.  Never again!!!!  I will book directly with a hotel chain, regardless of price.  At least I know that I will get what I paid for.  HEY EXPEDIA, WRITE YOUR RESTRICTIONS ON YOUR CONFIRMATION PAGE!!!!

I could have booked our hotel directly to save money but chose to use Expedia to avoid the hassle of doing it separately. Turned out it was more hassle to try to book the package! To top it off they have denied me the Nectar points I was promised for booking the package due to their incompetence.

I know that Expedia Japan told you to call us, but I recommend you call Expedia Japan again. Sorry."" She didn't want to understand me or spend time explaining to me. Isn't a customer support supposed to be at least understand what the issue even though they can't help us?

My husband happened to check and saw the same booking was lowered - I would have saved $100 dollars. I was upset I paid for so much - booking early was not a good idea after all. I found they had a price guarantee and was so happy. But as it turns out, they will find every excuse NOT to refund the price difference, and I mean EVERY excuse.  They allow submission of ONE screen shot of evidence of the new price, so on my first submission, I created one screen shot but with 3 different pictures. They didn't even look at the entire thing!  They said I was missing information, which was on the screen shot had they looked at the rest of the picture. Why is it they cannot go in their own website to compare? I re-submitted the claim, showing the info they said was missing. Guess what? You can't win! They find some other excuse that something else (not even relevant to the pricing) is missing.

252	            Very very very disappointed with the service from this website. The first time we used this website I only had enough money to get a hotel for one night so I booked one online when I got to the hotel they told me they didn’t know why Expedia would book a room for me when they were already sold out. I called Expedia and figured that the refund would be immediate so after I went ahead and told her to do it she told me it takes 7 days to return to my account, meanwhile I am in a different state with no more money to get a hotel, I then asked her if I could transfer my money to a different hotel and she told me it was too late because she already processed the refund. I was really upset so I just hung up with that woman and I proceeded to call back when I called back I was extremely upset because I had no money and no where to stay. When I spoke with him he told me the same story at first that he couldn’t do anything because the refund was already processed so I proceeded to ask if they could give me a free room or something just so I had somewhere to stay and he refused for a while but I was persistent. He then told me he was going to speak to the manager and if the line got disconnected that he would call me back at my number and as soon as he put me on hold the phone got cut off and I never recieved a call back. The second time we stayed we booked the room online with Expedia and when we arrived at the hotel for some reason they would let us check in so we once again called Expedia and they told me that the only thing they could do was refund my money which was all I had again and that it would take 7 days. They are no help whatsoever and they really need to learn customer service.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

254	            I wish I could give them -5 stars.  This company is duplicitous, and completely unashamed of it.  They charge for services that airlines, car rentals companies and hotels do not acknowledge.  They will happily take your money, for such services as flight insurance, for example.  But you can't use that flight insurance to make any necessary changes to your travel, because your chosen airline doesn't acknowledge it.  If you contact customer service, be ready for a person whom you can barely understand, and who has an attitude that you even called at all.  In fact, it almost sounds like contempt for the customer.I have worked with the public for over twenty years, and I've never seen such consistent poor customer service.  Calling for help in the past has always gotten me a very rude person who has no real customer service skills, who is not interested in customer service skills, and sounds like they are miserable.   I am finished with giving these people a pass on their contempt for customers who are in need.  I take pride in good phone manners and politeness, but this is all over now, Expedia.  Did you know that you can go straight to the airlines and get the same great prices?  Don't waste time with thieves like Expedia.  You don't need middlemen to get good airfare.        	                2	1	Saturday	expedia	positive

256	            Absolutely fuming with this company...tried booking a holiday online with them on 9/5/18 put everything in and got to the payment section and the website told me my payment had been unauthorized. 10/5/18 tried to book again online with them and it said unauthorized again. So i thought i would then ring the expedia to speak to an adviser to see what the problem was. They confirmed nothing had been booked as they couldn't take payment. So i tried again over the phone for payment and they said that payment couldnt be taken again. I then went onto using my daughters card to try do the payment. She got an automatic notification from her bank to authorize a payment of a 'test' payment of £4.20 the women from expedia said that she had got details incorrect so not to authorize the payment. My daughter told the bank not to authorize the payment.I got off the phone to expedia and rang the bank straight away and they told be that expedia had take 2 x payments of £2981.70 and 3 x payments of £4.20 but told me both online and over the phone that they couldnt take the money. The bank couldnt do anything as expedia had taken the money so i would have to contact them.when ringing expedia back i was told i would need to wait 72 hours for the money to be put back into my account which has left me now all weekend with just £20.00 in my account. this is absolutely disgusting that they have taken the money they way they have and i would no recommend expedia with anyone wanting to book a holiday        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	neutral

258	            The information provided on the website for Price Match Guarantee is inaccurate and should have been updated more than half a year ago.  I have been told that the only does Price Match Guarantee for Hotels.  So when i submitted my application for my plane tickets they said I did not qualify.  The Price Match Guarantee program mentioned on the website is for bookings made before October 18, 2017.  According to the policy, a claim would have to be within 24 hours, so at this point no one would qualify.  I misread the first line...and now I am out $125.  There seems to be more misleading information than there is for people to know that Expedia has changed their Program.Do not make the same mistake as me.  At the time, I had 4 other companies to purchase my plane tickets, but I chose Expedia, expecting their service to be excellent.  I even encouraged my brother to book with them too.  Read their policy carefully more than once.    I requested them to update the website and it still looks the same to me...        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive
259	            I will never again book any services with Expedia. Worst customer service experience of my life. I feel the need to expose the fraud that is their so-called 100% refundable ticket purchase insurance, which they market without giving the fine-print until after you hit purchase on your tickets.  We bought tickets with United and NOTHING indicated we could not add our dog. In fact, it was the opposite, it indicated that we had to add him after booking. I even had my husband call via phone and ask. My husband had called and spoke with an Agent while I was booking the tickets online but before submitting I needed to know how to add a ticket for our dog since we are moving. The Agent said pets are added after the fact through a separate program called PetSafe, or as Checked Cargo depending on the airline. My husband found the PetSafe page, so I hit submit and bought flight insurance which said that our tickets would be 100% refundable.  We went to the PetSafe page with United and could not figure out how to add my dog. After an hour or more I became frustrated, so we called United.  They told us they were reviewing their program and we had to wait until May 1st to add him. We waited. May 1st they changed that deadline until mid-June. We are moving back to the United States and cannot simply leave our dog in Nicaragua.  We spent 12 days stressing and agonizing over how to get our dog to the United States, and finally got my husband a ticket with another airline that included my dog.  I am disabled from a year-old assault that left me one handed with a very painful condition and need the dog for my anxiety otherwise I can not sleep at night.  Due to my disability, I called and attempted to change my itinerary since I would have to be flying out of Liberia Costa Rica with our young son and several bags alone while my husband flew out of San Jose with the dog under our current itinerary, and all severely disabled.  This is not simply a matter of mere inconvenience, I have no one to help and very little money. The Agent said the insurance does not cover the situation, even though they had told us to book the tickets and we are in this situation because we followed their instructions!!  Now we are out an extra $600 for another flight, over $1000 last minute arrangements for the dog, plus a second hotel stay, and I have no idea how I am going to make it through the airport alone without aid with one hand and these people could care less that they left us in this position.  My advice is to book with a company that is more careful about answering seemingly simple customer questions.  It is unconscionable that they did this and have zero accountability.        	                2	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
260	            We arrived in Paris on Saturday to the 2 room apartment we had booked through expedia and had been confirmed online. The confirmation informed us to call a number provided to check in on the day as there was not a check in desk. When I called this number, while standing outside the apartment with a party of 4, I was informed that the place had been double booked. The company lied and said they had tried to call, however no missed calls or messages were received. No solutions were offered so after demanding this was sorted we were offered alternative accommodation 30 minutes away in a non central location. Following this we called Expedia to arrange a more suitable alternative. After an hour on the phone a solution was found. Expedia offered to cover the difference in price, however after a quick google it was clear the accommodation provided was cheaper that what we had paid for.The hotel was undesirable and we were only offered only 1 room  despite being a party of 4 (3 adults and 1 baby) which had a double bed and a sofa bed in which my mother-in-law had to sleep in.No apologies, or refunds were offered, and no information on what  action  expedia will take to deal with their provider has been given. We have been offered a £25 gift voucher, which is completely unacceptable and does not even begin to cover the wasted time we spent on the phone, the stress of having to rearrange travel last minute with a baby and elderly woman in tow and the inadequate accommodation that was provided in place of our original booking.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

262	            DO NOT USE EXPEDIA TO BOOK FLIGHTS! I bought tickets for Christmas in California on Virgin America that we had to cancel due to the wildfires. Soon after we cancelled Virgin was sold to Alaska Air. I am currently trying to book, I’ve been on the phone for nearly 4 hours today (so far) and 1-1/2 last Friday, no one knows how to apply the credit since it was in Virgin America. I find it hard to believe that I am the only person that has had a credit in the past 5 months since they sold. Most of the employees, including the “supervisor “didn’t even know the companies merged. They say never say never, I’m sayin’ NEVER!

The person said it would be OK and that someone would confirm this, when I got the call this evening they said there is nothing they could do and its my fault, even though I contacted them within 1 minute of process. Very rude, very arrogant &amp; very poor. Avoid at all costs, I wish I did.**They are obviously buying reviews on Feefo, how can there be such a difference between the two sites, impossible.

I booked a trip to Hawaii from Vancouver, Canada with Expedia online and when they send me the itinerary the dates were wrong.They had booked me a totally different flight with WestJet a month before my actual intended holiday so it appeared I had missed my flight. When I called them they gave me a run around. The customer service is the worst I have experienced. They told me I had missed the flight/ I was a no show and they could not do anything. They gave me some BS about how they had screen shots of me clicking on the wrong dates. They are full of it and save yourself heart ache. I will never ever use their services.

My payment went toward the hotel I didn't want, and Expedia told me it was up to that hotel to refund me my money. In the end, the other hotel did not refund my money, and I had to book the original hotel I wanted using a different web site (I needed a very particular location). In the end, choosing to use Expedia cost me double! And speaking with their arrogant, condescending ""support"" staff was one of the worst parts. I will never deal with this company again.

I called the airline and they directed me back to Expedia 2.5 hours later nothing was resolved and I did not get what I purchased  I would strongly suggest not using this site to book any vacations that are going to be spectacular, because you will be let down and waste a ton of time correcting something that should have been done from the beginning.  I also would like to add the customer service dept is not helpful and Jessica Hernandez and Dave Carters need to find new jobs in a field that doesn't require leaving a positive lasting impression.

269	            Buyer Beware!I really wish I had looked at reviews before using Expedia but we have used them in the past with no problems. Obviously things have changed. We booked a rental car recently. The optional insurance was taken out immediately but not the rental car fee. When I received the charges the $392 fee had gone up to $534. I called Expedia and was told it was because I had chosen the pay later option so I was actually charged by the rental company not Expedia. First I don't recall being given that option and definitly would have paid upfront had that been given to me, as I prefer to do that when traveling. So what-read the fine print? Not sure where that was found. Not really sure what the point was in using them and I will never do it again.

It was supposed to be non-smoking, and some of the fixtures were broken or in disrepair. The room was nasty and gross, and the hotel manager was less than helpful. He decided to just book another hotel room in a neighboring town (since nothing else was available in Athens). We called Expedia even though the cancellation policies on hotel rooms clearly stated that he couldn't receive a refund. Expedia contacted the hotel manager to verify our story, and we are receiving a full refund for that hotel room!

276	            Terrible experience after booking tickets. Two big issues...1) Don't expect a refund to your card if something is canceled and they tell you a refund is issued. Both my travel companion and I were supposedly issued a $347.97 USD credit each on our AMEX cards for canceled hotel rooms.  2 weeks ago I called and they stated they issued the credit to my AMEX card and to wait.  As proof they sent me an email stating that the credit had been issued 2 weeks before my call and to allow 15 days for my credit card to show it.  Well, it has been 4 WEEKS = I MONTH and nothing has hit my account.  They have not processed the credits they told me they issued.  AMEX reflects credits within a day or 2 from when the vendor issues it.2) Car that was reserved in Mexico per the Expedia Website for $11.54 USD to be paid to the car rental agency plus the $44.00 USD that was paid direct to Expedia.  When we picked up the car the agency charged us $252.xx USD   Huge Difference. I called Expedia and after struggling to get them to understand the issue they said they would have someone contact the agency.  When I returned the car nothing was fixed.  So after some fighting with the agency I was able to get them to drop it to $44.73 USD  still a far cry from $11.54 USD.  I never heard from Expedia on this matter.Last week I emailed them stating that if the credit was not in my account by yesterday (giving them a whole week more) I would start posting this experience in all the rating sites ..... well, no response to the email and NO credit ... so here it is.These situations are Unacceptable.I am a Financial controller of a Very large company.

After trying to ring and get hold of someone, going backwards and forwards, it was the lovely receptionist in our hotel that said we could stay the night and they will drive us to their sister hotel a few km away for the rest of our time in Rome. We were so lucky the hotel staff were so understanding and helpful otherwise we would have been screwed! They could have turned us away and left us... and Expedia wouldn't of helped. The guy on the phone was nice enough but to be honest it isn't good enough.

I decided after I had booked to go ahead and add the car collision insurance.  The website says:""You can add insurance to your booking at checkout, as well as at any time after booking up to 24 hours before the day of your scheduled pickup.""  I called after I could not find the link in my itinerary to do so, and the agent told me that I could only add within 24 hours after booking.  ""Booking"" and ""Scheduled Pickup"" are two different things.

In general, I have been very happy with them: their costumer support has helped me a lot in some difficult situations, and they have refunded me in one case where there was some misinformation on their part.They are very useful to find cheap flights, and they announce if the company will charge anything extra. In general I have been happy to use them. Please note that:* The flights might be slightly more expensive than if you buy them directly. Eg, a Lisbon-London flight might be 205€ on Expedia and €200 on the TAP site). But I enjoy the possibility of comparing prices.* I didn't try any hotels or car rental, just the flights.So in general, good costumer support and a nice place to see all the flight prices.        	                5	4	Friday	expedia	positive

They have to not con people into thinking theyre getting a good deal and then AFTER the purchase is complete reveal they completely changed the dates selected. They conveniently change the check in and out dates and dont reveal it until after payment confirmation because they know if people see it's wrong they obviously won't proceed. I've read theyre quite known for this unethical scam tactic. After it takes an hour to contact them directly they state they can't do anything about it so your only options are to not get a refund + pay a cancellation fee(so crazy), or argue with customer service to make the dates right which conveniently for them ends up doubles the price, so you have no choice but to pay double the cost of what they originally advertised. Never again will I use Expedia for any of my travels and I happen to travel quite frequently.

287	            Never again!  For our stay at the Holiday Inn Express in Rotterdam we had to pay more than double (Instead of € 116,- exactly € 268,- excl city tax) Reason:The comparison site Trivago or Expedia booking site (Both blame each other) changed our booking dates. Instead from 7 to 8 of april they made a reservation from 4 to 5 april. After typing destination and date we clicked on the 'Trivago View deal button', proceeding to the pop-up offer of Trivago's partner and majority shareholder Expedia. We received a confirmation which we had to open with the app-store because the other mailed possibility to view the confirmation directly on the mobile phone did not show-up. Obviously Expedia wants us to download the app but we did not follow their 'redirection'. On arrival at the Rotterdam Holiday Inn Express on the 7th of april the receptionist told us that our reservation was already expired. She was so cooperative to connect us by phone to an Expedia Helpdesk. Their customer service told us surprisingly that this happens quite often by using Trivago. She could arrange a refund of our payment in case we made a booking with the Holiday Inn for the actual price of € 268,-  Because we had an important meeting and needed time to fresh-up, we had to accept the offer. Checking  Internet reviews we discovered on the HIGHYA site that Trivago/Expedia carry a long list of complains: Changed booking dates; incorrect prices; lost bookings and an unresponsive customer service ignoring email conversation. Anyhow we are still surprised that an International Hotel Chain like Holiday Inn works with companies like this. Their receptionists handled us professional as the typical victims of the Trivago-Expedia connection because as I mentioned before Expedia is majority share holder of Trivago.Read here Trivagos reply on our review on Trustpilot:Dear K. , thank you for contacting trivago on this behalf. I am shocked to hear what has happened to you during your stay in Rotterdam. First of, I would like to sincerely apologize for the great inconvenience this has caused you. Please bear in mind that we are not involved in the booking process and are thus unable to make changes to your booking or switch the chosen booking dates. What can happen from time to time is that the data exchange between the trivago and booking site interface is faulty, meaning that while being redirected the dates will change to the default dates set by the booking site itself, Expedia in this case. I am very sorry you have come across this technical glitch. Please contact me so that I may explain the issue at hand in more detail and resolve it as soon as possible.

290	            THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER AND I AM NEVER USING EXPEDIA AGAIN.My husband was traveling for work in the Los Angeles as he is a singer and I had booked him a package on Expedia that included the car hotel and round trip ticket which cost me approximately $1200. Due to severe weather American airlines cancelled the flight, AND EXPEDIA REFUSED TO HELP ME OR REFUND ME. I explained to them that going there the next day would not help because my husband was performing on the 14th and this was a business trip and that he would now lose out on his money for the ticet and performance that was being paid by the restaurant. They would not help me so I went to book AIR canada Flight  to arrive in LA for 8:42 which cost me approximately $500. I also paid $25 for baggage online which he did not end up using as he planned to take Uber right away to the restaurant where he is performing and avoid delays so he only took a carry on.The flight that was supposed to leave at 6:35 ended up leaving at 9:01 PM which means that he will not make it now to the show because he will not land until 10:30 and take another 45 minutes to get to the restaurant. His show is now cancelled and the restaurant had to call in another singer to fill his spot. Therefore, this trip ended up costing me $1,700 which we will not get back since he lost his show and on top of it the $1000 he was going to get paid for performing, he will not receive. This has been the worst experience ever and cost us a fortune. We are so upset never in my life am I using this crappy website called expedia!!!!! I am going to post this on my social media so everyone can hear about our horrible experience        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative

292	            Just checking flight and itnerary and realized that MY name was on two of my 4 plane tickets!  After several hours with expedia and airline I had to buy a new ticket at $850 (original ticket was $500)I felt like a dope having put my name on 2 tickets- but having read a number of reviews tonight I'm not so sure where the error lies!  Do you think in the day and age of smart sw programs that the platform would have flagged an error having put the same exact name on two tickets for the same flight?  I no longer think the mistake was mine- there are just too many customers complaining of the exact same problem!  What are the chances? I  haven't even left yet and I am terrified that when I get there I will not be in the right room (paid for an upgrade) I have booked my own travel for more than 20 years on various online booking sites and have never had a problem...when I did the problem was quickly corrected.

293	            My wife has been using Expedia for both personal and business travel for a long time so much so that she is an “elite member” and gets extra perks such as better customer service. On her bucket list has been Turks and Caicos so she booked a week vacation there in what turned out to be one of the most colossal disappointments by Expedia.  First off they had misrepresented the hotel and then wouldn’t even let us cancel even before we moved into our room. After spending hours on the phone and getting cutoff and having to call back and wait to talk to someone, their solution was to let us stay at the place we wanted to leave in an upgraded room that we had to pay extra for. We didn’t want an upgrade or anything free, we just wanted to cancel and salvage our vacation. Even though my wife spends tens of thousands of dollars with Expedia each year, they did nothing for us. If that is how they treat her then I can only imagine how they treat average customers thinking about using Expedia for the first time. We are done with Expedia.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	positive

We ended up chatting with a ""manager"" who explained that all I needed to do was get a doctors note and they would be able to refund me in FULL instead of charging us $200 per person for cancelling our flights. When we sent in our doctors note, someone else responded to our email stating that we needed to contact the airline about a refund, not Expedia.

Yes they sent me a confirmation, but it was way at the bottom of the email so didn’t see the actual price charged. when you're booking a trip, scroll to the very bottom, don't just assume you're getting the rate that was advertised. I will book all my hotels directly through the hotel.  Another guest booked through the hotel directly 3 days in advance and actually got a deal for $150 less per night.  That is a huge difference! Feel very scammed.  The hotel says they cannot do anything about it, because I actually pay through Expedia.  DO NOT BOOK YOUR HOTEL ROOMS THROUGH EXPEDIA, or make certain to check those confirmation emails thoroughly and cancel right away if the charges are higher than what was advertised. Had to go through 2 callers at Expedia who could only say ""unfortunately, it is what it is...then the manager (Jasmine) who could actually do something about it was very rude and said, ""well, this is just how it is through travel websites, lied and said I viewed the email 8 times that same day (which I know for a fact I did not) and the price can change on a hour to hour basis.

Spirit Airlines refunded my money immediately. After three phone calls and 4 hours later, Expedia told me the hotel would not refund my $1300 and I only had 10 days to use the reservation credit. I explained that there were no flights going to Cancun in the next 48 hours. I had to go back to work and my children had to return to college  on Monday . In desperation I asked them to move the reservation to the following day in hopes a flight would become available. I was then told that they could do that but I could no longer have my original 375 sq ft room and the only option left was a 1287 square foot room for $700 a night. My complaint is they did not offer me a comprable room or a reasonable amount of time to reschedule the trip. Also, when I first called from the airport they put me on hold for 15 minutes and hung up on me. The second time I called was an hour (which I was on hold most of the time) I was told Expedia could not reach the reservations employee at the hotel because they were at lunch and Expedia would return my call in 2 hours time. I explained that I could not wait two hours because I was trying to find a flight out. The third time I called Expedia that day I asked to speak to a supervisor at which time I was put on hold for 15 minutes and then 30 minutes.  Needless to say, I never spoke to a supervisor. The entire time the customer service agents spoke as if they were robots, not a slight bit of compassion for a situation that was very stressful and frustrating.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

I am a 100% sure of that because I checked the flight times likes 6 times to be sure I didn't had the evening flight. And what do you know? I get the evening flight tickets in my email. So I immediately called Expedia and they told me they can't do anything for me because the tickets I bought were with Easyjet. So I had to call easyjet. Called easyjet 2 that morning and they didn't cared a bit. Weren't listening just like Expedia. After I tried calling easyjet twice to explain my situation and them not caring at all, I tried contacting Expedia again through chat. The chat was terrible. The girl just repeated over and over she was not gonna help me and after 3 times she just said in the chat ""I'm gonna leave now"" and left. So rude. The worse thing is, apparently those calls were not within my phone plan and cost me now €60!! And on top of that I paid more for this tickets (that I didn't even want or booked) than I would have if I reserved them on the easyjet website. I paid €5 more then if I would've bought the ticket at easyjet website. So yeah, I'm so super screwed and money down the drain on a flight ticket that is completely useless to me.

His brilliant response was ""oh well, the rules changed a year or so ago"" I ADVISE ANYONE CONSIDERING USING THIS SERVICE TO RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!!

325	            I booked a Royal Caribbean cruise to Alaska through Expedia. After making the reservation with $1,000 deposit, the next email about my reservation was a cancellation of my booking because remaining payment was not paid by due date. Making the full payment did slip off my mind after paying the deposit a few months ago, but I do think that Expedia should send a reminder to customers prior to cancellation.  When I talked to an Expedia rep for the 3rd time, she said 2 reminders were sent to my email, which I did not receive, but she refused to provide any proof. I doubt the integrity of this rep, as well as the company as a whole. She said Expedia does not earn any commission from cruise reservation through them. Also, I cannot communicate directly with Royal Caribbean to solve this issue because the cruise line has limited information about my reservation through Expedia. Expedia has to make the call with their phone system that only allows 2 parties on the phone at the same, so if the rep does not stand by her customers, then, there is not much the customers can do. I cannot rebook the same room with the same cruise because it was full.

327	"            I booked a trip from the US to Brazil with expedia and got a message suggesting a protection plan, since unexpected things happen and they would cover me. It was a simple opt-in box.There was probably a link to terms and conditions, but not noticeable and not clear enough to the point I couldn't see it.Well, i had to change my flight because of visa issues and that's when I found out about the conditions: only in case of death/health or legal problems. The ""protection"" plan itself is very limited, yet communicated with such a misleading message that it gets close to a scam practice.Legally, they are right, because the T&amp;Cs mention it, although it is not made clear to customers. expedia is legally correct, but under very sneaky, cheap, reckless practices.Not reliable at all. Plus, there are better websites to get deals, including Kayak.com        "	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative
328	            Can you give 0 stars? Expedia definitely deserve it. Their 'customer service' staff lack knowledge and are bordering on incompetent. They seemed to have an issue with my accent (Scottish) and could not pronounce my name (which I find offensive). The booking process needs to be more transparent, as does the cancellation process. When asked to explain why they charged £10  per train cancellation, I was eventually advised it was the train company who charged it. However, when I asked what happened when multi train operators had been booked, there was no answer forthcoming. I wish I had looked at review sites and social media before booking. However, I've learned my lesson and will NEVER use Expedia again. I'd rather pay more to book with a reputable, honest company who really believe in trying to please their customers.        	                7	1	Thursday	expedia	neutral
329	"            Just got off the phone with this ""company"".  I cancelled a car rental the beginning of February for a car reserved (in San Diego) for March.

They refused to refund the amount (paid in full) UNLESS I submitted a letter from the doctor confirming the surgery.  I did not!  So I was charged for the entire amount.  TODAY, I discovered a strange charge from San Diego.  I called my credit card company and they said it was for a rental car??????????????  They noted it was fraud.

331	            I booked a flight through them in the USA with Delta airlines rather then directly.  I opted to pay for the next level thinking this covered baggage in the hold.  It was approx £40 more for both of us.  The site was confusing and it turned out all you got was to choose your seats.  I would never pay this for such a item.I phoned Expedia and they accepted that it was confusing and that normally a first level upgrade would include hold luggage (as did my other USA airline booking with United airlines). Expedia said they could not change this with the airline which I understand, but they have me a £50 voucher to spend within the next year.Great service, understanding and acceptance.

332	            I wanted to share my first and last time using Expedia to book anything. I was in San Diego last week, March 8, 2018  and wound up using Expedia to reserve a rental car with Ace. After booking the reservation I received the usual emails saying I was good to go. When I arrived to pick up the car however, the agent told me that my reservation was CANCELLED!!!!! He had few other details as to why but hinted that third party providers, like Expedia, allow you to rent a car that isn't actually available so once Ace got the reservation, they cancelled it.I got no email from anyone that my reservation was cancelled. Now I am extremely upset standing at the counter with no reservation and wound up renting a car from them. Not for $80.94 like I thought I would be but for $282. Plus Expedia charged me a $30 fee but I do not know what that was for..I felt like I walked right into a scam with both Ace and Expedia.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

We contacted expedia and after numerous calls at our expense,  we were finaly told the day before we flew that the time was sufficient, but if we have any problems to book an earlier flight and they would refund us. We did need to book another flight as we were told there was no way we would make our connecting flight in sydney. Expedia now take no responsibility for this.

334	            I made a reservation with Expedia at New Haven DaysIn. They charged me, placed the reservation, and told me my reservation was done. When I got to the hotel I was suppose to be staying at, they told me there was no reservation and had no room available for me. I called Expedia and they said they were going to communicate with the hotel about it. After they spoke with each other, they made another reservation in another hotel. I paid a taxi to get there and when I got to the other hotel they reserved for me, there was no reservation made in that hotel neither. I had to call Expedia again and they made another reservation in another hotel. I spent more than $300 in taxi going from hotel to hotel, in the middle of nowhere being 20 degrees outside. If anyone is planning to use Expedia for anything, please do not trust them. I am saying this because of my personal experience.        	                2	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
335	            I tried to make a booking for a flight and hotel deal advertised on the Expedia website. Twice it would not take payment.I telephoned their customer services and attempted the booking manually. The same thing happened. The customer services operative told me my bank had stopped payment - a call to my bank proved this was not the case and they were able to give authorisation codes against the failed payments that had been rejected by Expedia. I was then subjected to telephone encounters with a collection of imbeciles who told lie upon lie as to why the booking would not go through, even though they admitting they had a problem with their system, and kept telling me to 'call back later'. By this time the hotel places had been booked.Refusing to accept this abysmal level of customer service I wrote an e mail to the UK CEO Philip Pentland, the content of which probably made him splutter his coffee.Once the issue was dealt with by the escalated complaints team. Finally good sense was applied by the probably only honest and competent staff member in the company, and a more expensive booking was made with a promised refund of the difference in price.To say I am not impressed with their frontline customer agents is an understatement - each one I dealt with was so ignorant, lazy and incompetent, that I am wondering how they are still in business        	                8	2	Saturday	expedia	negative

Request made on online booking at time of booking was ""My husband is disabled and we will require a QUIET, accessible room with a stand alone shower (not a bath and not shower over a bath). Thank you.""In writing and received by Expedia is ""Booked. No need to reconfirm.""Luckily I had the intelligence to check up on this room request before travelling over 1000 miles! I phoned Macdonald Marine Hotel and Spa, North Berwick and spoke to Tracy at Reception. No room request had been put forward at all!! They had us booked into a non-accessible room.I called Expedia to complain and was told they would call me back once they had spoken to the hotel. I told them - regardless - I wanted this treated as a complaint as a) I should not have had to be phoning around like this and b) when checked up on Expedia had not done their job. Waited for individual to call me back which somebody did from Phoenix, Arizona! Luckily I answered the phone with this number displayed on the screen and immediately asked if I was paying for this international call on my mobile. The answer was ""no"".Person said it is sorted out and I said I am an intelligent human being and know it is sorted out BECAUSE I SORTED IT OUT - NOT EXPEDIA.They have faulted on their booking, taken our money and not even had the common decency to deal with the complaint or even apologise. I asked on no less than 6 occasions that this be treated as a complaint against them and for a complaint reference number to which they merely said I am to use my booking number. Clearly that is NOT A COMPLAINT REFERENCE NUMBER! The woman kept saying the matter is sorted out. It is not sorted out because I sorted it out, not them. I will still be complaining against them. They are acting as travel agents and have taken my booking and my money. They are governed by the Equality Act and have not fulfilled their obligations imposed on them at outset.

It was Economy rental and they wouldn't do anything to help me either.  This came after waiting on hold for close to 90 minutes and trying to chat with customer service at the same time.

350	"            Booked a vacation for our family of 5 to Punta Cana. We went last year to a different resort and stayed in a family suite which was perfect. The room had 2 rooms one with a King Bed and another with 2 Twin beds. When I called this year I told the agent that I had heard of the family suite at the Royalton and asked her if it had a King bed and 2 Twin beds and she said it did. It should go without being said that everyone should have a bed to sleep on. However, after I booked the room I found out that the family suites only have 1 bed and a sofa bed. We are paying over $1800 per person and my 3 children ( 2 being teenagers over 5'10"") have to all sleep on a sofa bed. This is absolutely ridiculous. Expedia is refusing to do anything about this and is blaming us. I would have never booked this room if I knew that there weren't enough beds for us all. Expedia has told us that we can pay an additional $4,000 american to get a second room. We are absolutely appalled. We will 100% never use or recommend Expedia!

At one point, they had me on hold for 28 minutes with nobody checking up on me. On three occasions, the call DISCONNECTED M. And even though they said they would call me back if the call dropped, they didn’t and I had to call THEM back and go through the process of talking to 5 different people before they put me in contact with the person I was dealing with to begin with.At the end of the five and a half hour conversation, they came back with: “We can’t help you.” Why was I being transferred and put on hold and explaining my situation over and over again for over 5 hours? They claim it wasn’t their error even though their website and their email confirmation says a different flight than the itinerary. They were not apologetic and they were defensive with everything I said and claimed it was our fault and not their error.They refused to put us on a different flight or compensate us anything.

As a visitor, I did not have GPS/ data on my phone, but somehow was able to locate their offices and reach there at 11:00 AM.3. I show my confirmation to redeem the pass and they said that Expedia has not send them the confirmation and they can redeem it only if they provide a physical printed copy of the confirmation (I don''t understand why Expedia did not provide a confirmation to London Pass and the processes could have been smoother).4. I had to search for an internet cafe and get a printed copy of the confirmation and finally got the pass after 12:00 noon.5. Rude customer service6.

360	"            ""The total price includes all mandatory taxes and fees"". That was from the itinerary that I got from Expedia.       Expedia knows about the hidden fees charged by vendors that but they don't warn their customers about them. In this case, Hertz Rental Car will add a $4.95 daily ""administrative fee"" at the JFK location, and possibly other locations, because their cars come equipped with a toll pass device. The daily fee begins after the first time the car is driven through a toll where it registers and is not based on actual toll charges. I was told that with the device, I would not have to pay any tolls, only a $4.95 daily fee. Since this was never mentioned on my itinerary that Expedia sent me with the following statement: ""The total price includes all mandatory taxes and fees"". I asked if I could decline the option and I was told no. So after a 10 hour flight and with two kids to look after I was stuck with this additional ""administrative fee"" In addition I was also charged an additional fee of $18.25 of toll fees where the thing didn't work.    Expedia knows about these charges and does nothing to warn their customers about them. My itinerary listed other possible charges for equipment such as booster seats, underage drivers, collision coverage etc. that I might choose to purchase, but nothing about the mandatory toll pass device.     When I called to complain about the added fee they tried to pass it off to Hertz even though I booked through Expedia and they are well aware of the practice,      I do not mind paying my fair share of tolls and would have gladly paid automatically for any tolls that I went through, which I ended up doing anyway to the sum of $18.25, or just paying manually at the toll both, but I don't like getting hit with the unexpected Mandatory Equipment charge and then getting hit with the toll fees anyways.    I spent 21 minutes on the phone today with Expedia and gave them every opportunity to make the situation right but they continued to pass the buck and say that I needed to take up the situation up with Hertz.     BAIT AND SWITCH plain and simple.     There is a reason that you will see so many 1 star ratings for Expedia on the internet.

Yet, when the request had to be made, Expedia stated the refund could only be obtained after a medical doctor stated the ticket holder was under medical care and that this travel would be unduly hazardous to the persons health.The letter was provided and now we've gotten the run around - check will be send soon - for 7 weeks!!!!Latest letter says Expedia will submit paperwork to the airline – they did this 5 weeks ago.JUST MORE STALLING!!!!!FIRST - LAST AND ONLY TIME WE'LL MAKE THE MISTAKE OF USING EXPEDIA'S SERVICES!!!!!!        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	positive
364	            Surprise Deposit situation. Booked and then realised a week before that there was a pricey deposit to pay. Called through to expedia and they had no clue. Deposit was more than our hotel and flights put together. We prepared for that though weren't too happy as we're students, but anyway when we got there, it was less than half that. Clarity would have been great, saved us worrying that we missed smallprint somewhere. apart from that excellent trip!!!        	                1	3	Friday	expedia	positive
365	            I just booked a hotel for 9 nights @ £666.55 as Expedia advertised and it wasn't until I'd paid the confirmation e-mail arrived showing an additional £125 in 'taxes and fees' which is almost 20% mark up.Before booking I had scanned the pages for any reference to taxes and found none. This cannot be right...it sure isn't transparent and I won't be using Expedia again.        	                9	1	Thursday	expedia	neutral
366	"            Expedia experiences FREQUENT ""technical problems.  When you call in, the support agents are all in another country.  You can't receive verification emails from them - they tried 5 times to send them and it wouldn't go through.  Had to speak to a supervisor to get confirmation on a reservation.  It is clear that Expedia is unable to handle the traffic they receive and they simply don't have people qualified to resolve things.  You are better off working with a different company.  I am sad that my experiences have been so bad because I will be traveling for all of the last 6 months of the year and liked the idea of having everything in one place.  At least I found out how terrible the service is before I made more than 3 reservations.        "	                12	1	Wednesday	expedia	neutral
367	            Went to book a round-trip flight/one-night hotel combo last night. Bundle price was ~$750, so sure, I’ll book. Then I went to purchase the bundle and it wouldn’t submit my order, and wouldn’t even tell me why. I tried 5+ times after that, even completely redoing my order and same thing happened. Tried again the next day and the same bundle jumped up almost $2000. Talked to a representative and she told me one of the flights I wanted to book went up in price. So I decided I’d look at other avenues. Between Google Flights and Hotel.com, I ended up finding almost EXACTLY the same price I initially found the night before using EXACTLY the same flights. So I don’t know what Expedia was trying to do, but considering that was my first experience trying to find a flight on my own, I will never use Expedia again.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	neutral
368	"            Careful!  Expedia will miss book you and then ask for penalty fees to correct it!  This happened to me twice. The first time I was in a hurry and thought it was my fault that they booked the wrong dates. Expedia was very sweet and changed my booking... with a penalty fee of course. This was only seconds after I had made the original ""on line"" booking. So the next time I used it I was very careful to make sure the dates were entered correct. Guess what... the booking came through on the wrong dates again!  I was charged an additional $5 fee to change it to the correct date.  It sucks but I do not have the time or energy to argue over $5 so i just paid it, but i will not use Expedia again.  The long and the short of it - Doesn't mater what date you want, they will book the wrong date and charge you extra to fix it.  Good luck!        "	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	neutral

376	            I have had two very negative experiences with Expedia and will never use them again.  I spend at least 4 hours on the line with them on 3 different occasions trying to get them to refund over $700 which was an overpay since we traded our rental van in for a small car.  I made two trips down to the Alamo center in Maui and they sent emails to the designated email I was sent from Expedia and I sent emails and called and they would not accept any of the verification and as of today, it is three weeks later and they are still refusing to issue any refund.  Alamo is charging me $34.50 a day and Expedia is refusing to issue the refund.  They were exceptionally rude on the phone.  I am a Business Owner and frequent traveler and will not be using their services again.  In both of my instances, it would have been much easier to deal directly with the hotel or the car rental agency.  They are simply a middleman and do everything they can to keep money.  I was not surprised to look online and see that they consistently try to keep refunds from other customers too.  Use the power of the pocketbook and lets shut them down.

I'd stayed at two hotels and so I didn't notice this first error until arriving home. So Expedia said they would sort out my refund from the hotel Amber Residence in Lagos. Nothing happened and so time after time I contacted Expedia again and again and was told each time to exercise some patience. Eventually I gave up after four months of trying... I told Expedia there is no point emailing the hotel as you will get no response as I'd tried this method myself...They then told me they'd emailed the hotel!!...So it was quite obvious they had no intention of solving the issue and also the hotel too...I paid twice for my accommodation and so therefore I'd not wish to use Expedia again for my travel arrangements in case of a problem needing to be solved. There was a total lack of interest and helpfulness. Just fobbing me off each time in a robotic way..My advise is don't use this company or hotel.        	                3	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

I was valid a $2000 credit because we accidently made a mistake to the spelling on a booking, expedia was f****** useless and wouldnt let us change it so therefore we couldnt hop on our flight which was going to the U.S. So they gave us a credit to use after 5 hrs of asking them to. They sent us an email on the 3/2/17 saying ; This is to inform you that the credit for this booking has been processed , credit is valid for 1 year , amount -1,986.98NZD , in order to rebook you would need to pay 100NZD + fare difference . We were sent this email on the 3/2/17. BUT when we try to use it they say oh sorry its unvalid you had to use it on the 17/1/18 ??? oh okay thanks for letting us know that sweet! so from a simple mistake we have had to fork out $4000 and now we have lost $2000.

She then advised me to book the hotel separately on expedia as i already had confirmation of the flight and that expedia would refund me what i would've saved as a package. i then had to do all the maths! and it was £30 they owed me.  I also realised that in the package deal it included insurance and i asked if this would have went through with the flight. she said yes and if not then youll also be refunded the £20 insurance.  she said i would be refunded within 5-7 days. i did not get my refund its been 20 days now! i also realised i did not have any insurance and so they now owe me £50.This agent clearly did not know what she was doing i was on the phone with her over an hour and that is wihout the long holds she put me on! she even asked to call me back half way through when i was clearly distressed and nearly crying about the bad service! i asked to speak to a manager several times which i did not get to do.I have rung expedia again and they say they have no documents about my call. meaning that this agent did not even put through the refund or document the things we talked about! luckily the man was helpful on the phone the second time and has refunded me the amount as a 'gesture of good will' he said even though it is clearly what i am entitled to.Although, i have been promised a refund to the money i am owed.

I spent a total of 10 hours on hold. No direct phone number to contact supervisors. Many different excuses and explanations. never talked to the same person twice. Purchased a 2 flight  tickets for 1100.00 each and was charged double. 4400.00. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE.  No proof that I mis purchased. no follow up emails until I demanded that they send me one. I finally ran out of time. I decided that changing the flight in order to receive the least financial impact was my only semi solution. To change the ticket I was told that I would only get a credit towards the airline of the purchase minus the 300 per ticket change charge.No way they were the highest priced carrier to South America Latham working under American Airlines. I had to cancel to get out of the 4400 purchase after 10 hour on hold with maybe a total of 2 hour of conversation with 5 operators and 3 supervisors and 2 second tier supervisors what ever they are?? Finally cancelled lost 800.00 plus the travel insurance 1000.00 total. I am still waiting for the 3400.00 refund from the cancellation. Horrible and illegal I am sure.

I requested many times that at least let me speak to someone who are reviewing my claim but nobody has the courtesy to call me.

I booked several times when travelling to different destinations and everything seems to be straightforward.I found the website really easy to navigate, and the content including travelling information very detailed, including hotels taxes and total cost.The only relevant information that I noticed that has been changing,  is the suitcase allowance when booking flights or selecting packages. For example, previously the economy class was including 23Kg suitcase allowance as a standard in most of the Airlines  ( British Airways, Lufthansa, Virgin A etc). I noticed that now,  in Expedia you have to pay the suitcase separately, having only as an allowance a handbag. ( not travelling with Easyjet or Ryanair which I particularly avoid)  Taking this into consideration I booked the flight directly with British Airways in the same Economy class but it was including the 23 KG suitcase allowance.  I booked the hotel through Expedia which still they have very competitive prices and easy booking Overall, I am very happy with the service and general customer journey experience. p.s - I love the fact that Nectar's points are added when booking at Expedia.        	                7	4	Wednesday	expedia	positive

400	            I Doubt expedía (already 1 star ) ever notices these reviews but needed to get this off my chest! I Reserved thru Expedia 7 months ago ( I’m a “gold card” member-what a joke that means) an automatic transmission 7 person passenger van for family get together in Spain. I know automatic passenger vans  are very difficult to find and reserve which is why I did so months ago. I called a week before my trip was to commence to ask about extending the reservation for an additional 5 days. I also emailed from my itinerary link but never got An answer.  Monday Jan 8, now Calling for the 5 day extension,  the agent told me she would look into the price and possibility of a new Reservation. I told her I did not want to lose My current reservation unless I was sure that I wouldn’t lose my automatic transmission reserved car (from 7 months prior) and that the price was acceptable. The agent came back to me with an acceptable price and told me it would be no problem to make the change. I accepted and she said the new itinerary would arrive shortly. I promptly received new itinerary 7320934296375.  Immediately we noticed our reservation hadBeen changed to manual transmission. I calledBack immediately to advise expedía of the error and was told they would escalate my case and try to get the reservation backTo the automatice transmission, and since I was flying to Spain on Wednesday 10th, I need it to be done as I wouldn’t be able to call again.  Of course nothing was taken careOf. Friday 12th I was told by my brother in law the car was not automatic when they went to avis to do the pickup. I told him To take it, we had no choice and that I would call expedía for an explanation as to who dropped the ball and never worked on fixing our reservation that expedía and expedía only SCREWED UP.  I made an international call from the Barcelona airport, lasting almost An hour Long. Telling my story for the third time like no one ever heard it and was promised it would be taken care of Once they could speak to avís in Malaga airport. As I was flying at that moment Barcelona-Malaga, I received an email from Kristine “gold Team specialist” at 8:30 pm telling me I had to speak with her supervisorTo get my issue resolved. I called back that evening at 1:33 am and between holds and transfers To supervisors And telling my story to everyone all over again I logged over a 1 1/2 hour international call. The agent “Adam” called Me back and for another 36 minutes he and eventually his supervisor documented my complaint, however the supervisor couldn’t  resolve anything, as once again they couldn’t contact Spain Avis at that late hour and of course no one had ever tried to do any resolution on their own between phone calls. He PROMISED I would be called back on Saturday between 8:30am-12 noon to discuss a resolution once they spoke to Spain. Noon came and went and no call back.  Saturday At 1:57 I called again and for 35 minutes with telling my story once again and waiting for a supervisor to hopefully have someone read the documentation rather than me wasting more hours on the phone, after 35 minutes I gave up. “Becca” the supervisor was the absolute worst of all the expedía people I have spoken to and basically told me tough, Avis was not responsible and there wasNothing she would do, even though Expedia was the reason why I had the problem in the first place and they are the ones that letMy original reservation with avis get cancelled.   Due to the unavailability of an automatic van as was confirmed in our original reservation, we took the manual van and a different driverHad to be added for the rest of our family reunion time and we had To pay an Additional 80euros to add him to the contract. At this point I decided I could not waste anyMore of our time fighting with Expedia and was sure they would never contact me on their own anyway. Each contact after hours on the phone had the same result, “wePromise we will call you back” and they never do. I will resume fighting this issue as soon as I return to the states, however I must recommend NEVER order a rental car from Expedia !!! THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!        	                4	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

402	            Booked a flight with insurance and had to cancel it later.

403	            I called expedia to simply try and delay my flight and was left on the phone for 40 minutes, it was an international call from dubai to the united states. After 40 minutes I did not receive what I wanted and the line cut. I was told by the customer service operator that if the line cut i would get a call back and I did not. I called again and this time the phone was ONE HOUR and TWO MINUTES just to simply delay a flight for 2 days. I am going to pay an insanely large amount of money on my phone bill because of the extremely poor quality of service you are offering your customers. I would have done it online as on any other website if it were easy to do in the first place. On top of that I sent you a complaint just after this incident which was about 5 days ago and I still did not receive any sort of  reply or attention from them. and When I did only after posting all over social media, they practically said there's nothing they can do about it and then eventually stopped answering. Never using this poor poor service again.        	                2	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

405	            Soon after I lodged my complain about my missing points, Expedia customer service sent me an apologetic email, and as a goodwill gesture offered me £25.00 voucher to add within 72 hours to my account.It never happened, and I did not get it.I reminded them on 3 occasions, and they sent emails with same promise. The last promise was a week ago saying I will get the voucher within 48 hours.So far a week is gone and I did not get it.Empty promises.

406	            Do not book with Expedia. I have booked months in advance tickets with Expedia to Thailand, so I had a choice of the shortest flights.They just contacted me saying my return flight no longer operates and offered me a choice of additional flight that extends my journey by 3 hours, even so, they offer on their site another return flight for the same outbound flight I bought with no additional cost which only adds 20 minutes to the original flight. When I refused to take offered flight and ask for the refund, they refused on the basis that they are only obligated to refund me the money if they extend my journey 4 hours and not 3 hours.Is a scam they advertise the shortest flight only to get more sell, and don't care about the customers already bought tickets.

407	            Expedia is a cheat. My parents are going to Bangkok for a holiday. We booked through Expedia a deluxe room with breakfast. After we booked we were informed that our room is a superior room with a mini bar. We never chose the mini bar option since my parents don’t drink at all. The room price has gone up by Rs 10,000 and we are not given any breakfast. Expedia has totally cheated us. It is horrifying. When did not choose mini bar and my parents don’t drink they are stuck with mini bar. Expedia staff refuses to help.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
408	            I’ve used Expedia many times to book travel. They are great as long as you don’t have to make any changes to your booking. However, if you need to make any changes or modifications, they are horrible.  We booked a flight that was cancelled so we had to reschedule. Gave them a call and told them which flight we wanted and they said we should hear back from them in 48-72 hours when the change has been made. Didn’t hear from them. Called again and was told they would confirm in 48-72 hrs. Didn’t hear from them. With the power of social media, and after a bad tweet, they contacted me to help me with the problem. By this time, we couldn’t get on the flight we wanted and was waitlisted. We decided to call the airline directly ourselves and they said that there was still seats on the flight and there was still seats being sold on the Expedia website. They told us that if we were able to get through to the airline ourselves then we should just book with them. I’m almost certain that this is what we pay them to do. However, because we booked through Expedia, the airline couldn’t do anything.  We were told by Expedia that they could only contact the airline through email. In a world where technology has advanced so much, how is it that email is the only way for communication?  Expedia ended up booking us on a flight that we didn’t want and left us no choice but to take it. They will do anything to not issue you a refund. Their customer service is terrible and I will never book through them again        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative
409	            This is the worst experience I've got ever. I booked this hotel through expedia around 5:30pm, then due to my personal reason I tried to cancel on 7pm. Since I booked it through expedia, obviously I called expedia to help cancel this order. The service guy accepted my request, and said there might be some charges deductible, I said since it's my reason I have no problem to bear some costs. Then he asked me on line to wait for result. After 15-20mintues online waiting, he said the hotel disagreed to refund me, but would continue to charge me full. I said now it's only 7pm, and obviously I would not go to hotel for check in, why should I be charged for full amount? Then he suggested me to contact hotel directly. I said no, because I trust expedia, and I take myself as a customer of expedia, and I paid to expedia directly, why should I contact any other third party. Finally he said he will try tomorrow and give me updates, then there was no udpates until today. And the full amount charged next day from my credit card.I'm ok with this $143, cannot hurt me, but I really feel disappointed about expedia. After this matter, I cannot see any value of expedia. Why should I use expedia to book hotels? Expedia should get close cooperation with all partners including this small hotel. But from this matter, I cannot see the professional services or solutions on how to make its customer satisfied. So farewell expedia, you sucks!        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	neutral
410	            Booked hotel and rental care together to get best deal.  Chose the only car rental vendor that Expedia said had car and counter IN the airport.  Location drove my decision making as my husband is blind and luggage and shuttles make for difficult travel.  Learned on arrival that San Diego has NO counters or cars in airport. Expedia was sloppy and Economy rental is shady.  I pre-paid for insurance and vehicle.  In addition to my pre pay the vender required a very large hold on a card. In addition to the rental fee.  we had issues with this and after discussion with manager it was decided that Economy would refund our money and we would be free to make other plans.  I then learned that my pre-payment was never in the venders hands but still with Expedia.  Manager said I Do not have your money until rental complete and returned i will cancel and you will have to deal with Expedia to get your $.  His nasty grin should have been my first clue that my trouble had just begun! What a disaster speaking to “customer service” outside the US and spent 3.5 hours and a full week before I could get confirmation that they “plan to submit” request for refund.  It was not until I took to Facebook that I got the promise of a refund over a week after we were to start vacation.  There was no reason to make this process difficult!  I can think nothing but that the difficulty is built into their process. Never Again!        	                2	1	Friday	expedia	negative
411	"            Where to even begin. I have been a frequent traveller for years, up until the last few months I thought Expedia was a good idea. Here are issues that I believe are scams, terrible customer service, and unacceptable:1. Wait time to receive any assistance. In total I have spent upwards of 9 hours on hold waiting for assistance in the span of two weeks, after the Airline kept changing my flights and I had to call to reselect a better flight. I had to ask to be transferred to a different agent a couple of times when they don't understand what is going on (when the flight is changed you have the option to re-select a better flight due to the change at no charge. Some agents don't even know that and try to charge you).2. Advertise false information. a) I rented a car, and when I got to the airport I found out the location I selected wasn't in the airport (My fault for not paying attention even though when booking I clicked that I wanted airport location). I went on Expedia and it said I could cancel with no cost. So I did. THEN I get home and I still got charged and Expedia says ""well we don't charge you a cancellation, but the car rental company does"". That's unbelievable. I booked through them, and they say they just relay information to the consumer as they are not the actual car company. Yet they clearly relay wrong information!b) Cancellation insurance. NEVER buy this scam. They are quite clever in the way they advertise this. When you book it says Cancellation insurance, refund for any change or cancellation fees. My friend couldn't get a passport for her trip and I figured it wasn't a big deal since I bought the cancellation insurance, except this insurance is worth jack sh-t, which is apparently in the fine print that they hide on there. Only for medical emergencies does it apply really. 3) Poor customer service. I needed to change a flight due to the unwilling flight change the airline provided. The Expedia agents all told me there's nothing I can do and I cant change or get any money back. I called the airline directly and they had amazing customer service, made the change no problems. Expedia agents were clearly too lazy to even bother calling the airline for me.4) They will claim they have no responsibility or ability to do anything for your bookings since they just ""advertise"" for 3rd party companies. LESSON, always book directly through the service you want to receive.        "	                2	1	Friday	expedia	neutral
412	            In September we flew china southern airlines to Oslo . On the return trip, we were downgraded from business class to economy . China southern claimed that the scheduled plane had a problem and a smaller plane was sent.Since then I have been trying to get a refund through Expedia - a official doc was given by CSAIR which we are supposed to present to Expedia .The response from both Expedia and CSAIR  is disgusting to say the least . I have. Already written a separate review for CSAIR.This review is for Expedia .After almost 4 months. There is still no resolution.It takes up to 72 hours to get a response every time I emailed. The standard response is as below.The latest response is just typical ( as below). The most infuriating thing is that this is obviously a cut and taste from the standard email they sent out.  They have got my name wrong ( I am NOT Laura) and the phone number is not mine. Any surprise why they couldn’t get hold of me ?Never again , Expedia . Totally unprofessional and unhelpful .———Dear Laura,Your itinerary: 7247338674535Thank you for getting in touch in regards to the complaint for the flight booking.I apologise for the inconvenience caused.I tried to contact you at 64-(212) 559539; however, could not go through.

We will contact you at the earliest.I appreciate your understanding in this matter.Kind regards,RajdeepExpedia.co.nz Customer Support        	                2	1	Friday	expedia	negative
413	            I booked a holiday with Expedia.co.uk a few months ago. Yesterday about 36 hours before I started out, an e-mail from them, my hotel is closed for rennovations. ONLY 36 hours before travel. Why didn't they know earlier? i discussed accom alternatives and nothing suitable. i found on-line that I could have a full refund. Now although I booked a flight and hotel package with them, somehow the flight payment is taken separately and Thomas Cook now also charge you extra for 1 suitcase £25.00 each way. I spoke to 9 different Expedia staff for around 3-4 hours including their waiting time to get it all cancelled. The hotel dept said to cancel the flight first with the flight dept and the flight dept said the other way round. Being put on hold for almost 1 hr, then 33 mins, asking to speak to a manager 4 times, didn't get one, being cut off four times although I do have a weak signal where I live. If you come across this ask for a coupon for hours of convenience. I have a good one so will have to use them again once more only. this is WITHOUT PREJUDICE. It was OUTRAGEOUS that they took almost 2 hours to refund my flight. Go well.        	                12	1	Wednesday	expedia	neutral
414	            I wish I had read the reviews before I booked a hotel for a week.  This company is truly awful, and they are liars.  They say they make it easy to cancel or change your plans but that is NOT true by any stretch of the imagination.  I didn't even want to cancel, I just wanted to push my date back one night. It took over THREE hours on the phone with someone who didn't speak understandable English (no offense but it's true), only to be told it would be done, except the next day I got an email from them saying oh sorry but the hotel wouldn't allow it so we are going to charge you full price. I got to the hotel and they were confused, told me they would issue a refund of course! Except the refund was NEVER received because they had to issue it to Expedia who then POCKETED MY REFUND.        	                4	2	Wednesday	expedia	negative
415	            purchased a one day tour for 5 people that included private tour guide, tuk tuk transportation 1 day admission to temple and elephant ride. tour guide was 2 hours late did not receive admission (ended up paying additional 185 for that) did not receive elephant ride. hotel helped us get tour guide (he was 2 hours late). told tour guide that admission and elelphant ride was included in tour price. he called the tour company (which did not speak english) they said no. we couldn't call expedia as we had no phone to call the u.s.) when we returned to u.s. i immediately called expedia. said they could not call indochina tours because they did not speak english. then they said the tour was already over so they couldn't help. all in all the whole experience with expedia and indochina tours was very disappointing. Expedia offered zero help even to help us get in touch with the tour company.  I more than likely will not use them again. they were our middle man to help us with a tour that was booked through them and they offered nothing to help us. I would not recommend them and if you do need a tour go through the hotel. very disappointed.        	                2	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

417	            I am very disappointed by the service received at Expedia. I had two back to back flight cancellations and did not receive any notifications from Expedia, thus forced to stay 12 hours at the airport, and pay triple the amount to book through a different agency in order to get a flight out. I am entitled to a full refund by the flight agency and have been on hold for 3 hours+, and have still not received any compensation. I will never use Expedia again for my travel bookings.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative
418	            The flight booking went perfectly smoothly. We'd booked a flight and hotel bundle, and we got to the hotel with our reservation intact. The problem was, Expedia categorised people above 18 as adults while the hotel considered adults to be above 12 years old, which is why they wanted to charge us extra upon our arrival. After demanding we speak to the manager and have him contact Expedia to deal with the discrepancy, they gave in and realized there was some sort of mistake. My only complaint is that Expedia and some of the hotels it's partnered up with dont have the same idea about adult age and therefore prices are different.        	                1	4	Friday	expedia	neutral
419	            I cannot believe after all of these years using this company exclusively that they sold me an insurance policy that actually didn't allow me to cancel a flight 10 days in advance! I went thru a very lengthy process for nothing. I will never use this service again! With so many other companies offeriing similar services, I now know where not to go! Your affiliates are not trustworthy and you stink for not doing something about it!        	                2	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
420	            Called to cancel a flight reservation I had previously made, the change was due to an impending snow storm, and we needed to get our new seats together.  When I called their customer service line, I was eventually (after two minutes of failing to navigate the voice prompts to go straight to a customer service agent) connected to an agent (Alex) in the Philippines who seemed to take an extra-ordinary amount of time (as though it were part of their script) to look up the JetBlue policy on change/cancellation.  It actually took him more than 5 minutes to look this up, which should have been available in seconds.  I prompted him several times during that 5 minutes, and he kept telling me he was still looking it up.  Once he did, he informed me that they only offered an Expedia credit, that it had to be used within 1 year and that it had to be used with the same airline and for the same person (I purchased the ticked with a credit card for another person).  While I still asked him to cancel the flight, I asked to speak to a supervisor about how the credit after the change fee was issued.  He refused to cancel the flight, and told me that I would have to wait another 15-20 minutes to speak to a supervisor to cancel, and that I had to be on hold all that time to be connected, that he couldn't stay on the line with me, to make sure I didn't get disconnected in the interim.  At this point, I had already been on the phone with Expedia for almost 20 minutes, and waiting another 20-30 minutes (the usual 1.5x multiplier when customer service agents tell you anticipated hold times for a supervisor) just to cancel a flight I had paid for was frustrating, and I told him he wasn't managing my expectations well.  He eventually did connect me to Ed, his supervisor in the Philippines, who took another 5-10 minutes trying to explain the inflexibility in the cancellation rules, when I kept interrupting him to stop telling me the rules, to please cancel first, and then he can explain the rules.  Finally, at the 32 minute mark, he agreed to do so, but it took him another 2 minutes to do so.  I'm a long time Expedia user, I was one of the early adopters of their platform.  I will NEVER use them again.  They need to empower their customer service agents to solve problems, not delay the conversation hoping the customer will go away (happy or not) so they can keep their money.  They also need to empower their supervisors to do the same, instead of dragging out the conversations to make people hang up in frustration.DON'T USE EXPEDIA!!!  They will NOT support you, and even though I purchased travel insurance and was changing my flight because of an impending snow storm in the Northeast US, they wasted half an hour of vacation I will never get back, as well as guaranteeing that I will never use them again.  I would give the 0 stars if I could.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

424	            Would really recommend staying clear of this company. We booked a flight with them, and through circumstances outside of our control, missed the first leg of the 38 hour multiple-flight-trip. There was plenty of time to rearrange flights and make the rest of the journey, and we were advised by one Expedia staff member that we had only been marked as 'missing' our first leg and that our return journey and the remainder of our departing journey was still active, and able to be modified and kept. We expected to have to pay fees to change things. Instead, we spent the next six hours being redirected to multiple call centers and received conflicting information from multiple Expedia supervisors which resulted in us missing the remainder of the flights, and Expedia advising us to pay an additional $3,800 to re-book. Essentially, we were intentionally misinformed which resulted in financial gain by the company.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	neutral
425	            Well after my appalling booking episode a few years ago, I thought I would try and book another holiday today.  Just wasted two hours of my time and lost a holiday because of it.  I wanted 10 -11 nights away somewhere hot, last minute.  I stupidly went on chat and the person was very good saying they had seen I had been looking at Cancun (just slightly out of my budget) but they could give me Punta Cana in my budget and could I wait for them to bring it up.  A few minutes later and I was impressed and they offered a hotel I really liked at a reasonable price,and then I realised it was for one night only - the flight arrived after 8pm at night and left at 8am the following day taking another day to get back.  So actually only a few hours in resort at what was supposed to be a 10 night deal at 10 night xmas prices.  This was withdrawn but they didn't admit they had made a mistake.  They then offered me lots of other rubbish so called deals, in 2 star hotels with an 11.5 hour connection, when I had mentioned I wanted a maximum of 4 on numerous occasions.  I even increased my budget by quite a bit and they  offered me Tenerife.  Nothing wrong with Tenerife we have been numerous times but when I declined this I was offered it again saying it was a good deal as just below my now increased budget.  It was like they didn't actually read my messages and because I spent so long potentially waiting for them to help me, like they asked me to, I have actually lost a holiday I was going to go for with a different operator.  My kids are now very very upset as we can't go away boxing day as planned, and I have wasted most of Christmas Eve trying to get a holiday booked with expedia.  Please think twice before using, or at least call and speak to a real person - my mistake and now my family is left without a holiday.        	                4	1	Sunday	expedia	positive
426	            Never rent a car through Expedia. They accepted my reservation and gave me a confirmation number for an office that was closed. I was not able to rent a car and they offer no support. I suggest that you chose another website to reserve a car. Expedia will take reservation without confirming the business hours of the car rental office and will offer no assistance.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	neutral

428	            I made a booking through Expedia and wanted to alter it. So I called The customer service which is horrible and slow. They put you on hold forever. I called them twice and they gave me different info both the times..which was totally vague . First the customer care guy confused me with cancelation charges. Even after me asking him 3 times. And when that turned out to be wrong info, I decided to change my flight date, which when I called jet airways was costing me only 4500rs of extra payment(including iteration charges). And Expedia was charging me 14500rs for the same change. I could've directly booked with the airline. This makes no freaking sense! And now I am stuck with my tickets because Expedia has made it so difficult for me. They really need to be more transparent and reasonable with their policies.

431	            Be careful. I saw a hotel advertised for a very discounted rate. I almost completed the booking and the regular price popped up. I called Expedia and they said the website wasn't updated despite showing they had several rooms left @ the discounted price. Be careful of bait and switch tactics. This is not the first time similar experiences have happened. The first 2 times I gave them the benefit of the doubt. Not anymore!        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	positive
432	            Be warned! Having booked, and paid in full, with Expedia weeks before, we were horrified to arrive to the apartment reception at 4.30pm in Cape Verde, which we were due to be staying in, to be told of the problems they have incurred with Expedia on previous occasions – simply, they do not pay them. The apartment we were due to stay in did not have our booking confirmation or payment from Expedia so understandably they were reluctant to allow us to stay in their apartments unless we paid ourselves with our own spending money as they did not accept credit card. After numerous calls to Expedia to sort out the issue, and them also ringing me on my mobile – costing me £52 in call charges - they tried to locate other hotels available in the area. After a long flight and with luggage we were reluctant to traipse around in search for these other hotels. Expedia said they would email me alternative options with exact locations – this came through at 10.30pm that night! After such a stressful situation which spoilt the start of our holiday, we decided to take the matter into our hands so that we could start to enjoy the rest of the holiday and decided to pay for the apartment again ourselves with the view to get the money back from Expedia once we were back in the UK and not being charged to receive calls. Fortunately, the apartments had availability otherwise we would have been stranded and incurred further costs of taxis around the island looking for accommodation. We sought our travel money at a competitive price and as a result of having to pay for the apartment, using most of it, we had to inconveniently use our credit cards at places as we would have got a poor exchange rate if we were to get cash out. Once back in the UK, Expedia paid me back the original amount charged for the apartment a week later and as a good will gesture put £100 on my Expedia account to use with them – pretty useless seeing as I don’t ever want to use them again after this experience. I am still waiting for the £52 that it cost me in call charges for them to ring me to sort this issue out to be refunded back to me, despite contacting them on several occasions. Apparently they are experiencing transaction failures – I find this extremely hard to believe and imagine that this is working absolutely fine when it comes to taking money as opposed to refunding it. Each time I have received a call apologising, promising that it is going to be in my account within 7 working days – this was over a month ago now and it has still failed to appear in my account. When you speak to someone at Expedia, it is so difficult to hear them due to the other employees laughing, shouting, joking and cheering in the background. Maybe if their staff spent their time working and doing what they are supposed to be doing then customers would have their accommodation booked and sorted. I will be going back to using Booking.com, a trustworthy and reputable company who I have never experienced problems with. If you want a stress free and relaxing holiday with things going to plan and as they should, then I would suggest to not book through Expedia!        	                2	1	Wednesday	expedia	positive
433	            Previously used Expedia many times and had positive experiences.  I liked Expedia because I paid Expedia in full, locking in exchange rates and then Expedia would deal with providers.  Unfortunately that has changed.I tried booking 2 rooms in Greece and selected a room type that did not say 'only 1 room of this kind left'.  When I booked it turns out that I could only book 1, so I thought I would complete 1 and then do the second booking separately.  The first room was booked for AU925 and was a sea view.When I went back to the search section of Expedia to my surprise there were no sea view rooms left!  After some time of searching, also searching on alternative sites, I decided to book a more expensive room that was NOT sea view, but by this stage I was just keen to log off Expedia and end this horrible experience.Once I booked, shortly thereafter to my surprise an email from hotel telling me that they don't take AMEX!! ... and this was the way I paid for the first room a few mintues earlier so that did not make any sense to me at all. I responded to the hotel telling them that I booked a different room a few mins earlier on AMEX.I did not get a response, so I called Expedia today (20-12-17) and spoke to a rude man who was only interested in quoting policy with me and not interested in helping.He told me that the second room was 'obviously' pay to hotel, but the first room was pay to Expedia.  I told him that this was not obvious to me and that I wanted to cancel the second room.  He promptly said that this was against policy.Eventually he committed to calling the hotel and asking for a cancellation and then calling me back, but of course he never did.  To be honest with you, I did not expect him to call me back given his terrible customer service skills.Last time I use Expedia, and I will take every opportunity to highlight to everyone that is interested in reading reviews that Expedia used to be a market leader, but now they are terrible. Sad really.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	positive

435	            so i booked a car through expedia to go pick up in hertz near ontario,ca. When i called prior to the pick up time i was told that there is no availability for that day and they would put me on a waiting list. I called Expedia back to see what they can do for me and their Filipino customer rep put me on a hold for about half an hour to tell me that he spoke to Hertz and the car was waiting for me at Hertz. When i went to Hertz to pick up the vehicle, manager had no idea why would the Expedia guy say that when they never bothered to call. Customer service agent are not knowledgeable, speak poor English and hard to understand them. It is like speaking in 2 different languages. At the end, you dont get to find somebody who will understand your problem and help you. I ended up wasting all my day at Hertz without a car thanks to Expedia. Why would you let your customers book through your website when there are no cars available?  i am very frustrated. Horrible experience.

436	            These days the differentiating quality with travel agencies comes down to customer service in a market where every travel agency quote the same price within pennies of each other. My multi-tier, multi-attempt experience with Expedia resulted in complete disappointment due to their incompetency in executing airline rules properly. Thankfully, I have been successful in resolving my conflict directly with the airline and prevented losing about $800 due to Expedia failure to follow airline policy and their disinterest in solving it for me with the airline as my agent. I have pleaded my case with multiple tiers of Expedia support multiple times and they had no interest in helping me. The issue is now resolved by the airline, therefore there is nothing left for Expedia to fix, even though the root of the problem was Expedia's complete lack of competency with their agents. Never again I will do business with Expedia, even if that means I need to pay a dollar or two more to a different agency. I suggest everyone to do the same and stay away from Expedia! A dollar or two is not worth the headache and frustration when you realize you have given up the most important benefit in return, real customer assistance when you need it the most!        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive

438	            Expedia Ripped Us Off and they don’t care. We (5 family members) were returning from a funeral with a confirmed Expedia itinerary and we were not allowed to board our flight. We were stranded in another country, with no place to stay and no way back to the United States. - We called customer service multiple times and they acknowledged their mistake but were unwilling to rectify the problem.- Over 24hrs later, we were still stranded, with no way to go home. Our jobs and school were in jeopardy. - After paying $7500 for our initial round trip tickets, we were forced to pay an additional $10,000 for one way tickets on a different airline to get back to our families.- Customer service and Cooperate Office  were not helpful but they all apologized for their error but took no responsibility for it.- We complained on their website and sent an official letter to Expedia, with no response. - Expedia needs to return our money.This is an example of how big cooperations use their power to oppress and rip off the rest of us. There is power in numbers so please support us and share.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative
439	            This company does not care about its customers  and will take your money and turn around and tell you that you should have “read the fine print”. They make their money on hoping suckers will use their site for travel accommodations. They rip you off and when you voice your concern they make absolutely no effort to make it right to keep you as a customer and off they go with your money. I recommend Travelocity; their prices are always fair and they like to keep their customers. I’ve used Travelocity countless times and was always satisfied. I use Expedia once and they rip me off and tell me I should have read the fine print. Travelocity puts everything you shoUld know about your booking in large print near the “book this room” button.

441	            I booked a flight with Expedia recently, and at first everything seemed fine. I was charged in full and send a booking confirmation with no errors. Three days later I was charged again, a completely unauthorised use of my credit card details. I was refunded the same day, however I was refunded $100 less than I was charged. I have tried to get in contact with customer support many times but have heard nothing despite their promise to reply within 24 hours. Non-existent customer service for those that can't make international calls to their hotline. It has been over a week now and I am quickly running out of hope that I will ever receive a reply to my many emails. I am now extremely concerned that this company has my credit card details and seems fine make charges to my card without my permission. I didn't expect this off such a large and well-established company and now wish I had read reviews before booking. I have read of many similar situations of people getting double charged and NEVER receiving their money back. This company seems to literally steal money from their customers so please DO NOT USE THEM. I have booked through other online providers many times and have never had a problem, but Expedia is an absolute joke even if their prices seem cheap at first.        	                2	1	Sunday	expedia	positive
442	"            I recently purchased a dream holiday to Mauritius through Expedia, due to having had a terrible year.  We booked through Expedia (I didn't think to check Trustpilot -lesson learnt!)and ordered a half board holiday at a 5 star hotel. This was not a cheap holiday £6000 for the two of us.When we arrived at the hotel - not having taken phones or tablets with us, the hotel commented that we had not taken up the half board option as this was the norm. I explained that we had and had paid for it.  They said not and we would have to check with Expedia.  First try and find a telephone number for them.  We finally did and called - from Mauritius and were told that the investigation would take 48 hours and they would call us back then.   We were using the hotel phone.   They didn't! We called again and they told me that they had sent an email - again pretty pointless as the point of this holiday was to get away from it all.  They couldn't possibly tell us what the email said so we had to use the hotel facilities to see the email.  It was a comment saying that they had looked into it and that there was no error on their system.  I responded, via email that I was not happy and would be sending a complaint on our return.   I emphasised that we did not have phones and wouldn't be checking email until we returned.  We then paid the hotel another nearly £2000 to ""upgrade to half-board""On my return there were 6 missed calls on my phone, the last one saying that since I hadn't got back to them they assumed I was happy with their response.  They had also sent two further emails with the same assumption.I called and told them this was not the case and they passed the buck around.  Apparently their complaints department don't take telephone calls and their turnaround time is a minimum of 5 working days.   I said they must be very busy and was told that it could be up to 10 days, 5 days was the minimum response time.  I was called on Thursday 14th December when I was out with a friend and told them to call me back in an hour.  5 minutes later I got another call and again repeated the request.  Guess what - they didn't call me back until Friday 11am when I was at work.  Again I told them it was inconvenient.  They called me today at 10.00 and finally spoke to me - they would not accept that they had made an error.  I pointed out the cost we paid was the same as half board at the same hotel but I was treated like an idiot and told that was irrelevant.  AVOID EXPEDIA and their subsidiaries.  If you must book through them then make sure that you print each page of your booking as you go.  We ended up paying nearly £8000 for 2 of us to go on a dream holiday that should have cost £6k.  Absolutely disgusted with them and they are not prepared to negotiate. They failed to listen to my argument and just bullied me into submission.  I am looking to see if I can take this further but since I can't recreate the exact same holiday  (as it is in the past) I can't show it on Expedia.

443	            I booked a discounted rate airfare trip on 12/8-12/12. Due to weather, Delta was delayed for more than 8 hours and was unable to put me on a different flight to my destination. Delta confirmed more than once that I would get my money back. I got an email stating so, but I called Expedia to make sure. Expedia told me that because I bought the discounted rate ticket they were not returning my money (even though it was not my fault AND Delta stated they sent Expedia the money so that I could get my refund). I’ve been on the phone for over an hour, almost 2 now. Still didn’t get an answer. Never using them again.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive

448	"            For the past few weeks, I have been trying to cancel a booking that I made on Expedia, but nobody from any tier of Expedia has successfully accomplished anything to help me and I am beyond dissatisfied.I booked a hotel via trip advisor, and saw that I was able to get the hotel I wanted through a better price through Expedia.I was confident that the hotel I saw on Expedia was the hotel that I wanted, so I booked a non-refundable rate; however, once I received my receipt, the hotel Expedia booked me for was not the same. I called the first time and spoke to an Expedia agent who was definitely Indian and explained to her my situation. I told her that the hotel on Expedia was not linked up the same, so they needed to do something on their end since it was their fault. She agreed and seemed to totally understand my disappointment.She called the hotel while we were on the phone to see if she could get it cancelled; however, the hotel was closed at the time she called. She said she would email me the next day after the calling the hotel. The next morning, I received an email; however, the hotel denied my request to cancel. At this point I was started to get a bit agitated considering that I had evidence that this was Expedia's fault.I replied to their emails with screenshots of TripAdvisor showing one hotel, and a screenshot of the incorrect hotel after clicking on the Expedia link from that hotel. After about 2 days, I received an email saying that the hotel denied my request once again. At this point, I was determined to speak to somebody to tell me why they denied this request even though I had evidence that this was their fault. Again, I explained the situation to an Indian woman, and at the end of my story, she says, ""Okay, so you are calling to cancel your reservation?"" I was sure she did not understand English, and to prove I was correct, I asked her, ""Why did I say I was cancelling?"" She would have been able to understand this since I explained this whole issue to her and she had the emails right in front of her.She replied with, ""Ma'am I see that you have a reservation and you are calling to cancel. I can call the hotel if you like to see if they will cancel your reservation."" At this point, I was done. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and luckily, she understood. I spoke to a man named ""Kevin"" who actually understood the situation.He said he would pass the issue on to his corporate manager. He gave me a reference number and told me that somebody would contact me within 3 business days. After spending 30 minutes on the phone, I was sure that the issue would be resolved by the next time I talked. I ended up waiting 5 business days with no email or phone call from Expedia updating me with this situation.I called Expedia once again and ended up spending an hour on the phone trying to get this issue resolved. I ended up getting transferred to a woman named Jamila from the corporate Expedia office, and she told me to send a copy of my bank statement showing that I had paid from an email she provided. Before I was able to do this, our call was disconnected. I used the email that Jamila provided and gave her the information that I had.The hotel collects their payment onsite according to Expedia, so no money has been paid. All I want is to cancel the reservation. I have a lot of evidence showing that this is Expedia's mistake. Nobody has ever contacted me and I want this issue to be resolved.Because of Expedia's mistake, I am stuck with a hotel I don't want, and I have spent countless hours trying to resolve this issue with little success. Today, I tried contacting Expedia through Facebook again with all of my evidence, but nothing can be done. They accepted that it may have been a site error, but they refuse to cancel my reservation. Absolutely F- customer service.This has been a huge waste of time and energy.I will NEVER buy anything from Expedia again.I have truly thought about suing the company, but it's not worth the $300 they stole from me.

450	            Unbelievable poor service.  I booked a flight months ahead to Asia and then a week before the flight was informed that the airline changed their schedule and when I spent over 4 hours in 2 different phone calls to resolve the situation, they could not.  They blamed everything on the airline and said they couldn't help me unless I stuck with the same airline, which was obvious that wasn't possible.  At first I felt like they were trying to help but they were going to send up to a higher person to take care of, but in that time I lost another day while airfares went up even more and seats became unavailable.  I didn't wait until they called me back or I would still be waiting.  What they really did was give me options that cost hundreds more and took an extra day, which wasn't an option.  They promised a refund and then when I asked them to do that, I am still waiting on hold after they promised it would be no problem.  Expedia wouldn't take any responsibility for the problem.  I have used them many times and I'm pretty sure they are a big company.  But there are plenty of other options so I will no longer be using them.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	positive
451	            By far, the worst experience as a customer. The incompetence of call service is unbelievable. I have spent straight 8 hours on calling and waiting on the phone so that they update the name on my plane ticket.I was stuck in an infinite loop with the staff, they either end the conversation and are somehow always incapable of reaching me by phone (?!) or I wait for straight 40 minutes on the line. Each time I called I always reached some other staff member who did the EXACT SAME as the previous one, without reading the notes on the case. When I finally reached the point of paying the fee for the name change, they told me they will send me the confirmation e-mail. Needless to say I never received that e-mail. I will never be their costumer again, and will try to rate them with the worst grade wherever I can.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

457	            I purchased trip insurance through expedia thinking it was something like Travel Guard that I have used in the past. I had to cancel my trip and learned that their insurance on cancelled airlines is a farce. The only insurance is to pay the airline change fee which is limited and with many restrictions. You do not get a refund and the airline or at least Delta charges the more expensive fares on the replacement flight. The end result was that it was cheaper to forfeit my payment to Expedia and buy a whole new ticket.

464	            £1900 for my wife’s ticket to Australia, Expedia refuses to update her surname from her maiden name to her married name. They are liars and I will never be using them again if they can’t get this sorted. They expect us to cancel this ticket which even at £1900 each for economy somehow isn’t a refundable ticket and book a new one at £2100. In this age of instant communications they can’t update a passengers surname when she gets married... they are an online tech company for Christ sake!!!Update: 3 weeks have passed and still nowhere further with Expedia, all the airlines have agreed to the name change yet Expedia refuses to change the name and lies about blaming the airlines not allowing it even though all the airlines say it’s a non issue and have given approval for the name change.Such a scam company, never ever book with them, you have no protection with them.        	                2	1	Friday	expedia	negative
465	            Number:  7289320756646 Message: I want to start by saying I will NEVER use Expedia ever again. I am currently still on hold after 4 hours of trying to check in to my flight. Your ticketing agents made a mistake with my flight and I am having to pay the price. I have never in my life spent 4 hours trying to check in for a flight. Expedia has the WORST customer service I have ever experienced, HANDS DOWN. I will be letting all of my friends and family know how horrible this is and I will try to let everyone I know on social media- how horribly this was handled. Hopefully I will still be able to fly home with my wife this evening for Thanksgiving. I booked my flight with my wife and she checked in to her flight with ease. However, when I go to check in my for my flight I am told to contact a gate agent. After spending 2 hours on the phone with American Airlines, I learned that an expedia booking agent made a mistake with my flight. Although I have a seat confirmed on my flight from Chicago to LAX, the reservation is attached to a different flight in Las Vegas. Expedia confirmed that they made a mistake and assured me that they would resolve this with ease. I am currently STILL on hold, after 2 hours and 2 supervisors. I have never had such a frustrating customer service experience. This entire flight and my wife's flight BETTER be reimbursed. I also think the Expedia agent forgot to come back on the line since I have now been on hold for 35 minutes and nobody has checked in to let me know they are still working on it. Get your people some training. I am copying and pasting this email to blast out to my family and friends so nobody else has to go through this. I am hoping it will reach someone in your management office that will do right by this situation.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	positive
466	            Oh.My.God. I have been sitting on the phone for LITTERATLY 2 hours now when all I needed was to change a flight, check out of a hotel early and return my rental car to another airport. This is NOT rocket science. I was hoping to use them as our companies go-to travel arranger but defiantly not now. This was one of THEE most irritating experiences of my life. I have wasted 2 hours of my life on a 10 minute issue. It makes you think with all  the bad reviews I have read, what in the sam hell are the owners or the people in charge of this doing.....like if it were my company I would view this as unacceptable and do everything in my power to fix it.

I have been trying to chase a refund from 2 months back but no one takes ownership of the issue. Each time I call I am promised a call back because they need to call the property and find out if a refund is ok with them (which it was because they agreed to it on the day I left the property) but somehow Expedia just cant seem to sort it out their end. Looks like from the reviews I am not the only one. How did this company get so big?? Their customer service is horrendous!!!!!        	                2	1	Sunday	expedia	positive

It took me more than 2 hours to find another more expensive hotel in the same date at the same location.Expedia charged my credit card for both hotels and they do not accept they did that. They asked me to send them the screen shot of my credit card and so on.

I was informed of the price breakdown on the screen showing a room rate of $53 CAD a night and $4 in taxes. This gave me a total of $692 CAD. I accepted this rate and got a screen confirmation of the transaction. I then used the Print tab to print a receipt for my records. A few minutes later I received an email confirmation that the charge is $893 and not $692.

So they stole my flight money and cancellation policy fee. DO NOT USE EXPEDIA. THEY OR HORRIBLE AND THIEVES.

482	            I have just returned from a holiday in Dubai booked via Expedia.  I booked online for 2 Adults and my 17 year old daughter.  This holiday was advertised with breakfast included.  I paid for the holiday and the confirmation email didn't say breakfast included.  I rang Expedia and paid an extra 86 pounds for breakfast for my daughter.  On arrival at the Hotel I was told Expedia only booked a one bed room for 2 adults and no breakfast included. The hotel wanted to charge me to put an extra bed in the room and pay for the extra breakfast.  I was livid; I had already paid in full for the 3 of us!  Rang Expedia, they informed me would ring the Hotel and sort it out, I asked them to ring me back.  They didn't ring me back, the Hotel informed me Expedia had rang and said their records were correct!  As a goodwill gesture the hotel waivered the extra fee for the bed and breakfast for the week for my daughter, thankfully.  I had a telephone call from Expedia the next day, yet still they would not admit their fault, what I was most annoyed about was that I wanted them to speak to the Hotel and confirm I had paid in full but they seemed shy to do it.  To add injury to everything Hulash who rang me from Expedia gave his apologies and said will put 25 pounds on my account towards my next holiday.  What a joke - that won't get me to Cardiff and back on the train from where I live!  I have booked quite a few holidays with Expedia but this is definitely be the last - be warned, thank goodness for the good people of the Hotel we stayed in.        	                5	1	Wednesday	expedia	positive

488	"            STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST EXPEDIA!Within 5 minutes of booking an EXPEDIA ""BARGAIN FARE"" I called them to cancel the flight - Like everyone else, the only reason I use EXPEDIA is because they offer free 24hr cancellation. Their bargain fare is right up front to lure you in - BUT you have to book it first before you see the Itinerary. In my case the itinerary included an arrival in the middle of the night, which could not work for my frail elderly parents.   You then have to call EXPEDIA to cancel the flight only to be told that they ""CANNOT"" cancel or refund your flight ""because, unfortunately, they still have to pay the airline for the discounted flight"". EXPEDIA told me I had to call DELTA to get my refund/cancellation directly from them.  That is the policy.   I asked him to stay on the line while we placed a call to Delta to get the refund with the EXPEDIA supervisor on the call.  Delta interrupted the supervisor to say, very directly, that he was giving his customer MISINFORMATION!  Delta then directly told me, in front of the EXPEDIA supervisor, that no such policy existed between Delta and EXPEDIA, that there was no charge to EXPEDIA from Delta, that all Delta flights can be cancelled and refunded within 24 hrs, and advised me that, unfortunately, EXPEDIA was giving me misinformation, and unfortunately this was EXPEDIA lying to their customer.  She refused to talk to him directly after that, but advised me that EXPEDIA could refund my money.  The EXPEDIA rep may have been embarrassed, but it was now ""out there"" for me to hear.I continued the call with the rep, who put me through to CUSTOMER SERVICE.  They kept me on the line for over 2 HOURS saying the same things over and over ad nauseum, that their policy was NO REFUND. They would cancel the flight (how nice of them!) but would still charge me for it.I pushed the issue, knowing they had the ability to refund my money in seconds flat, so I could book a better flight, but they simply refused to do so, repeating the misinformation that they had an ""arrangement"" with the airlines.  I suggested putting this customer service rep on the phone with Delta, but he refused saying over and over that Delta was ""irrelevant"" to their policy.  Here, he was telling the truth - the airlines have NO relevance to EXPEDIA's refusal to refund (the airlines would indeed refund within 24 hrs) that they had no such ""arrangement"" with EXPEDIA which included a non-refundable situation.EXPEDIA LIES.

490	            Never ever ever use EXPEDIA MEXICO or USA, you may think that you are getting a great deal or saving time etc, but trust me in the end you are NOT!If you book airline tickets directly with the airlines you are given way more rights, have much more control of your booking than with EXPEDIA!  Once Expedia has your booking you are not allowed to change, cancel any more of your booking, whereas, with the airlines directly not only can you maybe hold the booking for 24 hrs but you can change or cancel as well.Two days ago, by a misunderstanding we accidentally booked flights on EXPEDIA with American Airlines and booked in January but thought it was December, 10 hours after booking we realised our mistake and called American Airlines to find out their policies for this and see if we can not change it. They said had we booked through them directly online then YES we could at no costs, but since we stupidly used EXPEDIA MEXICO we had to go through them but could not see a problem with this.  Expedia USA will change or cancel in a 24 hour period, and said that EXPEDIA worldwide was the same with the same policies so there should be no problem, and that is what we thought by using Expedia Mexico which we are automatically directed to when we search because we live in Mexico and thought this was best.   But NO NO NO they said we can only change or cancel up to 10pm that same day, we were a couple of hours over this but still under the 24 hour period.  They would not change or cancel our booking without charges (that obviously they would pocket all money because American Arline's did not charge).  It would cost us $700-USD to change to the month earlier on the same dates, and yes there was a small increase in far which would have been ok if that was only the cost, it would cost us $500USD to buy a whole new ticket.  Even to cancel EXPEDIA MEXICO was going to charge us to cancel plus then we would be charged more from American Airlines to re-issue the tickets.  So no matter what we do we can do nothing simply because we were so stupid as to book with EXPEDIA MEXICO.  I called American Airlines and had both EXPEDIA MEXICO on the line at the same time because the operator (Joseph) from EXPEDIA MEXICO wanted to hear for himself the policy of American Airlines, the agent told him we could change and did not understand why EXPEDIA MEXICO was refusing to do this for us, she said to talk to a manager, which he told me he was, and ask for a Sales Support Waiver to make the change, the agent Joseph hung up on both her and me, now you tell me what kind of service is this?Now we leave the ticket unused and just buy a complete new one with American Airlines directly.  What is this for Customer Service?  EXPEDIA MEXICO does not care and they wonder why in a couple of years they will be no existent, why use them when you have more benefits booking directly with the airlines and the cost is the same?AA Record Locator - USDVISExpedia Itinerary number - 7306666777265        	                2	1	Friday	expedia	negative
491	            I opted for $54 cancellation insurance on a flight since my meeting might be cancelled which it was. I mistakenly assumed that I could cancel for any reason and get a refund on my $800 flight. WRONG!! Of $800, I received a whopping $200 credit. Cancellation insurance only protects death or sickness which Expedia does NOT clearly mark on the page when you are opting for insurance. Furthermore, when you use two different airlines on depart and return, EACH AIRLINE CHARGES YOU BACK $200 REBOOKING FEE!! DOUBLE REBOOKING FEES!

Asked Expedia if we could cancel and they agreed (25th August). I booked 2 new flights with Etihad and asked for a refund of the Kuwait fare. Expedia agreed and after many phone calls told me I would definitely get my money by 7th September. This was a lie to get me off the phone and what followed was just more smoke and mirrors. at one point they even asked me if we would accept a hotel during the delay on a flight which they told me they had cancelled !!!!My last call (75 calls and e mails later) on OCTOBER 10th, they told me that Kuwait had agreed the refund but it would be 2 to 12 weeks before I got my money. I checked my credit card statement on 31st October and the money was refunded on OCTOBER 2nd !!Expedia should have known but couldn't care less. I bet if I called again today they would tell me it's 2 to 12 weeks. Not impressed at all. Hours of calls at my cost and time wasted on e mails and no apology at all.

493	            Took my wife on her birthday to Stockholm for a long weekend in July 2017 to a classy hotel in the suburbs 7km out of the centre, on the waterfront. Not knowing Stockholm, I booked the bus with Expedia from the airport direct to the hotel and received confirmation of booking. The bus terminated at the central bus station mid-evening, leaving us to take a taxi for SKr 300 (around £30) to get to the hotel. I asked Expedia for the taxi bill refund and one month later, I followed up and they tried to pass it off on the bus company, who run flight buses from the Airport to the centre and back.I scanned the itinerary Expedia had sent to me confirming my booking for bus to the hotel (and return!) and replied same day. They replied quickly by email to say that they had tried to call me on my number that they had completely jumbled. I resent the correct number and the following day, received a call from Expedia Arizona to say that the refund was being processed to my card account.I followed up a month later as no refund appeared. This time, no reply, nothing. It's not the amount of the money, its the way that they are so disconnected from the customer when there is a problem. The airline (Monarch) refunded within 7 days the £15 I had paid to reserve adjoining seats on the return flight, which they messed up, ... and they were in financial difficulty.        	                2	2	Wednesday	expedia	negative

495	            I booked a flight with Expedia and I paid for the insurance Cancellation Plan for the amount of $54. I needed to cancel the flights (mine and my daughter) for personal reasons. When I called customer service on 22/10/2017 and I explained the need to cancel it, they informed me they assign a case number and they will contact me via e-mail with the decision. The first call lasted an hour and ten minutes. During the first call I spoke to one representative and his manager for a total of 10 minutes and the remaining time I spent was on hold. I called again on 10./30/2017 to find out the status of my case and of course no review or decision was made. Again, I was put on hold for over an hour and 10 minutes and I spoke to a representative and supervisor for total of 10 minutes. During this time they kept telling me they need to discuss the case with a consular and review the case again. It was around 10:00 PM EDT when the supervisor informed they will call me in an hour with a decision. During this time, the supervisor kept informing me we are working on a refund and all should be good. I said I can't stay any longer and I informed them I will be contacting the NY attorney general and better business bureau for giving me the run around and not committing to their cancellation policy per my payment. The next day I received an e-mail informing me that my case was denied and I will not be getting a refund. Expedia doesn't not meet their commitment and they give people the run around, they charge you fees that they don't fulfill their commitment which is stealing. They put you on hold so you can decide to ignore the case and drop it. They play a game and I will not recommend it to anyone. I ended up calling the airline directly to cancel my flight and of course I lost on the deal because I ended up losing the $54 I paid for the insurance plus extra money. I will be canceling my account with Expedia and will never use them again. Bottom line they are thieves.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

497	            So dissapointed in Expedia!! I am a Expedia 'silver' member and have booked multiple trips and activities through them. Our most recent vacation included several flights and a car rental plus various activity tickets. The car agency was ridiculous , overcharged us and would not refund ( transcanada/ EZ car rental). I spent several hours on the phone with Expedia 'customer service' as I could receive no response directly from the rental company. Was told several time that Expedia would issue me a refund on good faith, only to hear after 30 minutes on hold that the supervisor would not approve it . All the Expedia reviews for this rental agency were positive but following this I started searching, only to find MULTIPLE horrible and very dishonourable reviews as well as very poor rating with the better business bureau of Canada.

I love the place we stayed in, but don't care for Expedia booke for one day and it was for at least two days, and also I'm disappointed that I booked for two big rooms and got one big and the other one was two smaller rooms split 🤔so much for that.

501	            Tried to book a flight to Richmond from New Hampshire to be with my brother as he was having brain surgery. I chose the flights I wanted, input my traveler information and payment information, then clicked confirm booking. Results came back that the flight pricing I had selected was not available and would be more than $150 more. So I go through the process of selecting a less desirable flight/time, clicked confirm booking again, same thing happened, this time flight was more than $200 more than that I had selected.  Still no booking confirmed.  I began getting credit card alerts regarding charges to my credit card....over 10 of them. I called Expedia was connected to someone who barely spoke English.  They advised me to wait two hours and try again . NOT.   I explained to the representative that they were over 10 potential charges on my credit card from Expedia.  The representative replied again wait a couple of hours and try again .   I told him I was not trying again because I didn't want any additional charges on my credit card and that I would not be using their service again .  finally called the airline directly and got a cheaper price than what Expedia.com was going to book me at.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	positive

503	"            STOLEN £95.01 for a fabricated booking.I booked 3 rooms with a hotel in St Albans.  I subsequently cancelled the rooms as when I called up to confirm all the rooms were booked and they were expecting us, the hotel informed me only one booking had been made with them and to turn up on the day and they'll see if they can fit us in... Upon cancelling I was provided with cancellation confirmation for each booking and was never charged.  One booking was around £85 another around £120 and another was £95.00 exactly.When scanning through my bank statements some weeks later I noticed ""Expedia £95.01""  I called them to get my money back and was sent back and forth between Expedia and Hotels.com for about an hour each blaming the other, finally I found out that Expedia is responsible ultimately as they took the money and they fall under the same company as Hotels.com.  The payment ID was linked to the hotel on the system however my name and email address were not linked, they told me the only way they could issue a refund was to send a screen shot of the bank statement to the email address they provided.  I did this only to be sent an email stating that I had to call hotels.com, once explaining AGAIN that I know it's their responsibility I received another email asking me to call a high charge rate customer services number with my bank card details so they could look in to the matter...  I had already done this when speaking with them and from this they advised to send the screen shot to the email address.  Round and round in circles I go!So... no further to finding out why they took the amount of money that was never even authorised, I am no closer to getting back the money they've essentially stolen from me.  Watch your bank statements!PS: with their offshore call centres it can be very difficult to have a helpful discussion as language presents a problem for many of the call centre staff.  I should mention however that the staff are always polite and friendly even though they have ZERO ability to actually help with their actions.        "	                7	1	Friday	expedia	negative
504	            Booked a hotel through Expedia. The hotel was awful and not 5* as thought. Shower curtains with holes in, so the room was flooded as the shower was in the middle of the room. Towels with rips in. Poor bedding. Rock hard beds. It was so disappointing considering it was a birthday weekend treat. Hotel was in a dangerously vandalised area, not close to the main attractions as stated. A “short walk” which was actually 30 mins plus. Expedia asked for photo evidence which I provided. However still now says they do not wish to help me. They do not care for the evidence given and disregarded customer service. So upset with the level of service. Once the moneys been handed over clearly your custom isn’t cared about anymore.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
505	            I booked a flight wih expedia and paid for it, however, due to some system failure in Expedia my booking did not go through, even though the money was paid. I booked it via Expedia NL, however the money somehow went to Expedia Germany. I had to make at least 5 calls, including calling Expedia Germany, loosing so much time, when I finally got some understanding of what had happened. In the end, the flight i needed to take costs twice more now. I will at least have the money reterned within 10 days. Honestly, I know it is cheaper to book flights via Expedia - but experience of dealing with this provider is not worth it.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	neutral

511	            I attempted to book a simple one night hotel stay using the Expedia website (expedia.co.nz in this instance).First problem: the website altered my booking dates to something completely spurious (not a typo!). I noticed this before submitting, changed it back and then sent off the booking. Expedia's automated booking reply acknowledged the booking but confirmed it was for spurious dates again!Second problem: despite multiple polite communications via their customer services website and their phone number over two weeks, and despite having direct email communication with the hotel agreeing to alter the dates, nine different Expedia customer services representatives have been involved and zero progress has been made. The Expedia complaints online form has repeatedly given an error message rather than submit my subsequent complaint and the customer services people refuse to escalate my concerns.Therefore it is impossible to deal with this company if it makes a mistake. Since this mistake seems to have occurred after submitting a booking request digitally, this means that there is no redress and no way to advise fellow travellers to be careful. Our money is lost and yours would be too.We will avoid Expedia from now on.

So I get passed around like an idiot and it turns out their insurance takes 2 months to process anything, the insurance wont cover the full amount for the flight change. I am really un satisfied as what is the reason to buy this insurance if it wont cover you for what you want. my suggestion is if you travel go get insurance from another company as this one is honestly useless.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	neutral

And every time I called, the phone call did not last less than 50 minutes. I just got off a 2 hour phone call and the result was ""im sorry mam, but there is nothing we can do about your situation."" This is ALL for a two day trip. I called multiple times and in the end, zero customer satisfaction, zero customer service. I will never choose Expedia again!!!

Finally left to get a room elsewhere. Expedia customer service is a joke.They wash their hands of all responsibility. If the hotel's policy is no refunds/no cancellations - then Expedia hides behind their policy - no matter what the situation. If ever there was a clear cut case of fraud - look no further. I'll save myself the trouble of ever speaking to the ""customer service"" representatives at Expedia and challenge the charge through my credit card.

Then there were technical issues, I was on the line for 45 minutes, rep comes back says the website is being updated, that I had a couple of minutes to cancel without being charged by the ""airlines"". once I stated I called within the timelines for changes, not my fault their website wasnot working.

We booked a flight, accommodation and transfers with expedia to Hungary. On the morning of the flight we tried to check our transfer pick up time in Hungary and eventhough we had a voucher couldnt find the booking. Phoned expedia, neither could they!!. They helpfully rang the transfer company, they couldnt find the booking or fit us on the transfer vehicle. Result, expedia said we will receive a refund . No explanation received why we had a transfer voucher  but no booking.  On our return from a lovely holiday. Discovered we had been overcharged on our debit card.  Complained to expedia and informed we will get a refund.  The overcharge they said resulted from the airline ryanair.  As far as I am aware Ryanair no longer charge a debit card fee, and the fees appeared on expedias site, not ryaair's  Warning, double check your debit card statements when booking with expediaAfter we submitted our complaint, we were none the wiser on why we had no transfer and who was responsible for the overpayment.

Both companies exhibit extremely poor customer service and accommodation. And I can honestly say I WOULD NOT and WILL NOT be recommending anyone to use either of the two companies, whether it be a family member,friend,coworker or even an acquaintance !My husband and I had booked a trip to go to Montego Bay , Jamaica for our honeymoon, our flight was delayed multiple times without reasoning. Staff members refused to elaborate the cause very cold and unprofessional.Upon calling JetBlue customer service  the representative failed to give any reasoning and was very unapologetic. To make matters even worse we had the same experience returning to JFK.I recently canceled a trip booked via Expedia due to a medical occurrence and Jetblue nor Expedia are willing to refund my money, even considering the fact I purchased travel insurance (in the event something beyond my control was to happen, resulting in not being able to travel). After playing unnecessary phone-tag and speaking to many rude, unsympathetic representatives along with their supervisors to no avail no one is willing to assist me. It is absolutely appalling and mostly disturbing to see such a lack of compassion that has failed to be given. For all that are considering flying or booking via Jetblue and or Expedia I would highly recommend NOT TO , because God forbid you have a medical ailment or any circumstance that is out of your control.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative

The agent put me on hold for over 2 hours, and told me I need to contact the airline myself. I contacted the airline, and airline told me to contact the third part agency to cancel. It is just going in a loop. I messaged Expedia on Facebook, and it's not helpful as well. After two days of waiting (because Expedia told me that they need to contact airline during business hours, and I had to find a 24 hours customer service phone number for the Expedia agent to contact China Southern Airline - this is how unknowlegable they are) the agent told me there is no way to cancel the ticket. Which is ridiculous, so you are force to lose the ticket even due to a medical emergency. I am sure this will not happen if i book directly through the airline. I will give Expedia a -10 star if I can. Never gonna book through them again, even though I have some point with them, I would rather lose those points then losing thousands of dollars on my tickets.        	                2	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

Just as we tried to put another card details in, we checked online banking and they'd taken the money anyway. No confirmation, receipt or anything!We then spent over 3 hours on the phone to multiple people who couldn't understand our issue, or how to fix it! We then received confirmation of flights but not the hotel, meaning we then had to attempt to have them find our £400 for the hotel and refund us- they had no idea where the money had gone. Once our bank had recalled the money(3 days later), we then had to buy a more expensive hotel elsewhere, as the package deal had reduced hotel costs greatly when we initially wanted to book.

541	"            Worst Company EVER!Recently I booked a Spring Break trip for myself, husband, and our daughter. We were due to depart PHL airport and arrive at NAS six months from now. I booked airfare through Expedia on American Airlines a nonstop flight for nearly $600 a ticket!!!!!!! I also booked a hotel room at the Atlantis Paradise Island. AFTER I booked the trip I received an email stating that I could not choose my seat on either flight. OR have the option of purchasing a bag/carry on to take with me on my week long trip to the Bahamas! I thought to myself ""good thing I bought travel insurance to the tune of $222.00 because I either need to upgrade my package to have the ability to (1) CHOOSE A SEAT ON THE AIRPLANE!!! (2) BRING A BAG ON THE AIRPLANE!!!!!!!!!"" So I just called Expedia tonight.... after 1 hour and 45 minutes on the phone mainly being on hold, talking to a customer service rep for maybe a total of 15mins, they told me I cannot change or cancel this reservation EVEN THOUGH I bought travel insurance!!!!! So basically if I got hit by a bus and couldnt make the trip... OH WELL I would be out nearly four grand because my travelers insurance ""does not apply""! NEVER EVER EVER WILL I BOOK WITH EXPEDIA.COM EVER AGAIN!        "	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	positive
542	            PRICE MATCH WASTE OF TIME! Don't even bother filling in the form, they will always refuse the price match. First they said it was a different room which I knew was a lie as I have been to that hotel many times and I know all the rooms are identical! Then they said it was because their cancellation policy was different. No two companies will ever have exactly the same cancellation policy so it will be impossible to ever get a match. I would imagine they have never honoured a single price match claim ever! BTW, the price difference was over £700 - needless to say, I made use of their cancellation policy and used the cheaper site instead (which incidentally, has 4 stars on Trustpilot).        	                3	1	Sunday	expedia	negative

544	            Terrible Company.  I booked an expensive transfer to my hotel as I was taking a very long flight to get to Zanzibar.  The transfer company - Vintage Africa - had no one to meet me at the airport.  After calling their hotline, I was told that someone was on the way to pick me up and would be there in 10 minutes. After one hour and several calls later, I took a local taxi which was clean, efficient, and one tenth the price!  I would be very surprised if Expedia is still around as a going concern in 5 years.  They are expensive and do not choose honest partners for services for their clients.        	                2	1	Thursday	expedia	neutral
545	            I booked a room for my elderly mother and my sister, who are both diabetic.  They had to evacuate FL and were on there way back.  They had been on the road over 10 hours when they were approaching the motel.  They were not notified by Expedia or the motel that they couldn't check in.  The motel lost electric.  They had to drive almost 24 hours to reach their home in Cape Coral FL.  I was on the phone with Expedia over 2 hours and they were not any help at all.  They said their lines for deals had closed.  I didn't care about any deals just needed a room for my mom so she could take her medicine.  Customer service totally unacceptable.        	                2	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

549	            Can you give less than one star? Although they are ATOL licenced, this does not help in any way with an ordinary complaint. Having been a travel agent for many years, I would urge you to use a good, old fashioned one. Unfortunately, I did not!!! Initially everything went very well and I was quite impressed although, when we arrived in Nerja, the coach driver could not get near the accommodation because Nerja is traffic free and we had to take all our luggage for a ten minute walk. Expedia did not tell us about this! Fortunately, my husband and I have good health and it was not difficult although rather annoying at 9.30 at night. As the return date approached we rang the transfer company about a pickup but they denied any knowledge and told me to ring Expedia. Having held on for some thirty minutes, I spoke to a very helpful young man called Jeff. He could not solve our problem but told us to get a taxi, get a receiot and claim it back on our return. Great solution I thought! However on our return, Expedia denied all knowledge of my conversation with Jeff,  gave no explanation or apology for the lack of a paid transfer and although they agreed, (as a gesture of goodwill, ha ha) to repay the taxi fare, despite repeated requests, we have not seen a euro!

A few days later I was looking to book the same hotel for a friend and found it cheaper on their own website. I got the screen shots and filled in the form and they denied my claim because I used a coupon. I highlighted in their terms state that publicly available coupons were fine. They then responded again with the email starting Dear Customer Name never a good start and stated they could not match that competitors website however it was actually their own expedia.co.uk!

The site made the booking, but the date was not correct - it was made for a date when I would be back in the UK.  I emailed them and cancelled it immediately.   I also contacted the hotel, and they cancelled the reservation.   I then received an email saying that expedia could not make the cancellation by email due to ""security reasons"".  !!   Said I had to call a number in India, which did not work.   Back in the UK, I received another email from the hotel, saying that expedia hadn't cancelled the reservation.   I called the helpline in the UK, and they refused to assist, saying it was a matter for the India office.  The .COM site had automatically redirected me to expedia.IN site, and the UK people refused to help.   The supervisor, Mr Darshan Ravi, refused to give me the name of his superior so that I could complain to the site.   These people are a total disgrace.  Never use them!

I was told not able to do and call back Friday. I was on hold for more than 5 hours, used 3 different numbers, 4 different phones and was told no. Seriously, company is heartless. A hurricane... it's not like I'm cancelling or asking to change because something I can help. Expedia's customer service is bad. 😡🙁 It's unfortunate. As upset as I am, I hope none of their people have to deal with the hurricane and pressures, worries that come with it. I will never use Expedia and I will pass the word on.

557	            Expedia customer service and agents are very nasty. My mom and I had planned this trip to Seattle about three months ago. It was supposed to be a great trip especially since this was on her bucket list after being ill for almost a year. And as soon as we arrived at the airport, this trip has been nothing but problems. First, since we booked the flight and hotel through Expedia, I almost missed my flight after being detained from proceeding through checkout because of my name on the Expedia ticket not matching my id. My mother had contacted customer service about this and the lady she spoke was supposed to correct my name, but little did we know she didn't. Our plane was already boarding. The gentlemen at the gate asked that I showed another form of id to match. All of this took forever since I had already checked in my bags. After waiting for a long time, he was nice enough to let my SS card suffice. The next thing is when we got to The Westin hotel in downtown Seattle, the agent there was very nasty. She told us that we couldn't check-in because on her end it didn't show that it was paid for through Expedia. She made us stand to the side and told us to contact Expedia. She also charged my moms card for a room that was already paid for 3 months prior. We had to call Expedia to tell them the situation which took about 30 to 45 minutes. Since then, we have been calling explaining the situation to 2 reps and 1 rep claimed that he could get us a 10% or 15% discount and change hotels. He was supposed to call us back and didn't. My mom called back and explained the situation to another lady who was also very nasty and indirectly stated that we weren't telling the truth. My mom then asked for a supervisor by the name of Jamie about the situation and Jamie proceeded to talk to my mom as if it she knew her personally. My mom stated that she didn't have to talk to her like that and Jamie proceeded to argue with mom about this when she should have been trying to fix the situation. She ended up hanging up on my mom. I work in the hotel industry and have been for years and I've never experience such reps that acts like that. Like, I was so shocked and still am. Meanwhile, my mother is here not having a good time and not enjoying a trip she had on her bucket list. I will be contacting corporate. Expedia won't here the last of this. I've never experienced such. I'm still shocked at this lady who supposed to be a manager hanging up on a customer and talking to her like a stranger on the street.

567	            MOMS BEWARE!!We’ve all heard it before. “As long as you stay on the resort you’ll be safe,” and with few exceptions it’s held true. But no one could possibly anticipate being inexplicably and suddenly tossed from the safety of the resort into the potential dangers of foreign streets. It’s unimaginable, but that’s exactly what Grand Bahia Principe Hotels &amp; Resorts in Punta Cana did to my son and his friend — while onsite Expedia representatives aided and abetted the nightmare.We wait, without a shred of acknowledgement, for words that could explain what possible circumstances could result in Expedia.com and Bahia Principe Resorts casting young Americans out of the safety of the resort, into the famously dangerous streets of the Dominican Republic.I should start from the beginning. Literally from the moment they arrived at Bahia Principe Hotels &amp; Resorts on July 17th, they were faced with very questionable conduct by the Resort. This past July, of 2017, my 22-year old son and his 21-year old friend were registered guests at Grand Bahia Principe Hotels &amp; Resorts in Punta Cana, which they booked through Expedia.com. On July 17th, as they were checking into the resort, an employee offered to “hook them up” with an upgraded room for a payment of $60 cash to the employee. Upon arriving at their upgraded room another Resort employee, Pablo, offered them a second upgrade, again for a payment of $60 cash. Expedia phone representatives would later reveal that my son and his friend had been upgraded twice due to overbooking at the resort.On July 19th, together with four friends from Toronto, Canada, my son and his friend, Chad, went to the Resort buffet to eat dinner. Upon entering, Chad realized he had neither his wallet nor phone. He went back to the pool thinking perhaps he’d left the items there. Not finding the items at the pool Chad returned to the buffet. Upon reentering the buffet, a resort employee approached Chad, and handed him his phone. Although faced with a difficult language barrier, Chad attempted to ask the worker where he’d found his phone, and how he knew it was his. Chad continued to try to explain to the worker that the wallet should have been with his phone — that if he found the phone he should also have found the wallet. The worker merely laughed at Chad who grew impatient and angry. My son encouraged Chad to go to the front desk to report the situation. Chad agreed, and as they began leaving the buffet, several resort workers waved Chad back and, as it turned out, they indeed had his wallet — and handed it back to him. Two days later, on the morning of July 21, without any warning whatsoever, at approximately 9:00 AM, Chad and and my son were abruptly awakened when a Bahia Principe employee, a security guard and an Expedia representative barged into their room, woke them and told them they were being ejected from the resort. “Get out now” was the only thing Chad and my son could decipher as neither of them was fully awake, and neither speaks Spanish. Panicked, my son called their friend, also a guest at the resort, who speaks Spanish. He asked the friend to speak with the Expedia representative to try to make sense of what was happening. The Expedia representative explained that the ejection had something to do with “a wallet,” and that apparently Chad had “touched” the buffet worker. No allegation was made involving my son, yet he was ordered out as well with the full support and active involvement of the Expedia representative at the Resort.Other than to encourage Chad to leave and report the wallet incident, my son had no involvement with the situation, but on the morning of the ejection, was given zero opportunity to defend himself. He was simply thrown out, despite that he begged for clarity and medical intervention. Not only did my son awaken to being thrown out of the resort, but he also awakened to find that his foot, which had been bothering him for several days, was now severely swollen due to what was later discovered to be a very serious bacterial infection. My son and his friend were rushed out of the resort. They were denied opportunity to speak with a manager. They begged, but were denied a translator. They were not taken to the front desk. They were simply forced to shove everything they owned into suitcases. They were led through the resort to the exit where their wrist bands were removed, and security forced them out. My son phoned me, scared, frantic and unsure what to do next. Equally as scared and frantic, and because of my son’s medical condition, I felt it necessary to involve the U.S. State Department. I made several calls and before long my son had spoken with a U.S. Congressman and we’d been connected with the U.S. Embassy in the DR.I needed to get my son back within the safety of a resort. By this time, though I’d tried to get Expedia to help without luck, I ended up booking my son and his friend at American-owned Hard Rock Hotel where I felt he and his friend would be safe and my son would get medical attention. Once checked in, the good people at the Hard Rock Hotel determined my son needed to be taken to a hospital. They took him to Hospiten Bavaro where doctors diagnosed him with a bacterial infection in the joints of his foot. The U.S. Embassy was kind enough to translate between my son, doctors and myself. My son was wheelchair bound the remainder of the trip.Later I phoned and spoke to Roy from Expedia.com, who attempted to call Bahia Principe, Punta Cana. The representative to whom he spoke rudely snapped at him that Chad and my son “had women in their room” after which Roy said the resort abruptly hung up on him. Roy confessed it made absolutely no sense to him.Once my son was safely at the Hard Rock resort, and as the gravity of the situation sinked in further, I called back and spoke to Expedia again — this time to a female whose name I could not decipher. She also attempted to speak to someone at Bahia Principe, and like Roy, she came back on the line and explained that she could not get a straight answer — and no one would permit her to speak with a manager. The next day, I finally got through to guest services at Bahia Principe. I spoke to someone who told me that Chad and my son were thrown out of the resort on the 21st because they were throwing food in the buffet on the 19th. The woman told me they were “drunk out of their minds.” The woman told me that they were asked to sign a piece of paper promising to behave better. She told me that in the following days they were fighting and being loud and that the police were summoned to the resort. Knowing my son and his friends, I found her story to be incredible. It just didn’t fit. My son had been sleeping a lot, and hadn’t been drinking or eating much because his foot had been hurting. In fact, my son characterized her account as a total fabrication, and he said that never were they presented with, nor did they sign, anything or engage with the police at any time. He said there was no incident or involvement with any staff outside of the issue with the wallet in the buffet. And there are four other witnesses from Canada who confirm the same.I asked the woman if she would be able to produce the paper they signed. She told me she could not — that it was a “private document for their corporate file.” In the meantime, the U.S. Embassy phoned and spoke to the police — the colonel — who said they’d not been called to the property at all. It appears likely that Bahia Principe is covering up for misconduct on the part of its employees on several levels, including the “shakedown” of two payments of $60 in cash for room “upgrades” and the taking of Chad’s wallet and cell phone. The resort’s conflicting explanations for forcibly removing my son and his friend are clearly without merit and fit a pattern of questionable conduct by the Resort’s employee from the moment of arrival. The role of the Expedia representative in aiding and abetting the wrongful removal of Chad and and my son from the Resort at a minimum violates Expedia’s duty to its customers and raises questions regarding their motivations.Expedia, which was located onsite, REFUSED to intervene, to represent its customers in any way whatsoever. Expedia’s representatives FAILED to respond to my son’s obvious need for medical attention. Expedia failed period.A couple weeks after my son was home safe and sound, I reached out, via email, to  the CEO of Expedia, Dara Khosrowshahi. I copied a number of senior executives on that email including Sarah Gavin, Head of Communications. Scott Weismiller, VP Global Customer Service Delivery, Liz Gorton, Customer Experience Director, Neha Parikh, Sr. Vice President, John Morrey, VP &amp; General Manager, and Tucker Moodey, Manager of Global Customer Operations. Three weeks later, not one of them has acknowledged me. I’d hoped Expedia would make no excuses — that they’d tell me nothing like this should have ever happened. I’d hoped for an apology and an admission that it was an egregious mistake that they fully intended to make certain never happened again — to anyone. I’d have been grateful for and satisfied with that. Their silence, however, is not only insult on top of injury, but it’s a clear message that they don’t care. Not only do they not care about the safety of their customers, but they don’t care about their own brand. That’s a dangerous combination. If they don’t care about their brand, they don’t care about you, me or our kids. Their silence made clear to me that it would be up to me to make certain others know that this can and does happen with Expedia and with Bahia Principe Hotels &amp; Resorts. People should be informed. That’s why I’m sharing, and I hope you will too.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive
568	            At the March this year I booked holiday package from Sydney to Phuket for 8 nights include flights( itinerary 7253367058546). It cost for me $4694.20 for 3 persons include way back. Flight back was 16/04/2017, but my wife was accidentally admitted to the hospital at 15/04/2017 with terminal condition( unconsciousness.,stop breathing ,and more,....ambulance....). So it was for me very stressful situation, and after that I contact with Expedia at the same day and ask them rebook my flight two days latter according with this situation.Contact with them was like nightmare ( very poor English communication, many times hung up without call back).So finally they ask me my credit card details for organise the same flight, but two days latter.At the same day I received from them travel documents without any explanation how much cost it, and OLD itinerary. So it make me sure that's everything is done....,but I check my bank and was in shock...!!!They charge me $ 4578.00 for way back.!!! Can you believe? I check online cost of flight back and even Qantas (very expensive flight) give to me price $2500.00 for 3 passengers. Mostly of the flights give to me price around $1500 for 3 passengers.Straight away I call to them about not authorised transection, and ask them cancel it. They promise to me call back with solution but did not.After that I try to refund my money, but they tell tell me about policy with no refund.Why I have double pay for way back???I inform my bank ( St. George bank) about this case, and request block this pending transection, but officer from the bank  did not do it and put this issue on investigation stage.My request is full refund my money  $ 4578.00, because I inform my bank before money came out (money was pending). Point is - this transection was not authorised by me, and not my flight confirmation ( I did not received itinerary till now).Expedia organise for me new flight instead rebook.There is CRIMINAL!!! This company should not exist anymore. They site must be closed now!!!Never trust them!!!P.S. They not provide they e-mail address for contact with them, and very difficult communicate with them by phone call. Also I ask them contact details they boss or head office, but all of my questions without answer till now.PS. I got 100% proof of it.

I had booked a hotel recently and was unable to get the coupon to work and so after I had payed for the hotel myself I tried to contact Expedia support which I was on hold for 1 hour+ only to be told that because of terms and conditions (which apparently are new from last week) they would be unable to put that credit onto the card that I had used to pay for the hotel. I am very unpleased with the customer support I have received not only from this time but in the past where it took me about 12 hours and about 15+ phone calls to Expedia just to get my flight issues fixed. I honestly don't see myself using Expedia again in the future for my flight/hotel reservations.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	positive
570	            Price guarantee is a joke.  Had no problems with travel plans.  Price guarantee never gets back to you on time, and then never actually matches price.  Make sure you get the right price because Expedia will NOT match prices.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	neutral
571	"            Expedia feels like a scam. They completely messed up one of my bookings, then offered $100 ""credit"" to my next trip. There is nowhere to put the code when I go to check-out, and while I'm on the phone with customer service (who also can't figure out why there promo code isn't showing up) my flight and hotel package goes up $70.....seriously?? What a waste of time.        "	                3	1	Saturday	expedia	negative
572	            After paying for a rental car through Expedia, the rental company charged me a large additional fee when I returned the car.  I called Expedia to get them to explain the fee.  The rep said he tried to call the rental company to get a breakdown of the charges, but the finance office was closed.  He said someone would work on it the next day and inform me.  After two days, no one had called or emailed me with any information.  So I used Expedia's customer service email address to request service.  Two days later, still no reply.  I will move my business to another travel site.        	                2	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

Only yesterday 24/8 I was shocked to discover that this hotel chain no longer have a contract with Expedia and my booking had been cancelled. The contact had ended the PREVIOUS September (information from Tom the hotel manager) yet they still advertise it on their website. I found out as my daughter is travelling to the hotel in Oxford.

574	            Wow! Expedia is so smart to fool customer. I have used Expedia for every vacation and it is convenience. I have asked price guarantee twice recently. Expedia always find out the excuse for refusing the request. One case, the competitor have much cheaper product than Expedia except free cancellation date. Expedia has free cancellation until 12/15 while competitor has 12/13. The other case, competitor offers exact same product with Expedia and additional car rental. So, hotel+car rental is cheaper than Expedia's hotel. Expedia refuse my claim because competitor offers additional service. Expedia price guarantee is useless. They will alway find out excuse.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive

576	            I recent booked a trip to Vienna through Expedia (I have never booked a holiday before) The main issue was the fact Expedia had put the the 'deluxe room' photos against the 'standard room' price at the hotel I had book. I only discovered this because I contacted the hotel to check everything as I've never booked before. Expedia sent me images of the deluxe room I thought I had booked attached to the confirmation. The hotel wanted €400 for the upgrade! Why should I pay that when I thought I already had it? I contacted Expedia for them to te me no error was made on their behalf, yet they changed the images on there website! I told them I had proof (before &amp; after) images but they still did not listen. What was even more frustrating was the fact that when I was complaining to Expedia I had a different person reply each time which meant I was repeating myself and they were all rather rude when responding. There was about 9 different names through 1 conversation, which when there's a complaint that's the last thing you should do. I finally got a call off a lady from Expedia who said if I upgrade the room for €400 they would give me 50% back - I was grateful for this and accepted.I then emailed Expedia to get written proof of this promise to then have someone reply telling me no!!! That no one told me I can't have this. The customer services as getting worse and worse - after I responded expressing my anger I got another email from someone else saying they apologies i do get this! Surely you would check this before telling the customer they are wrong!! Overall experience of booking a holiday for the first time should have been fun and exciting however thanks to Expedia it is going to make me worry when it comes to booking more in the future.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
577	            Horrible and very disappointed. For the first time I booked a hotel room through Expedia in South Carolina for my grandson's BCT graduation. Upon arrival for check in at Extended Stay America my mom and I find out that Expedia over booked people for there. We had to wait 2 hrs before they were able to assign us our rooms. I reserved 1studio rm with 2 beds...needless to say, they gave those rooms away, so we ended up with seperate 2 rooms ( at time of reserving the room I had to pay for all 3 nights in order to gaurantee the room for us and still never got what I reserved.) After finally getting our keys to the rooms we go into them and my mom's room had a lot of hair on the bathroom floor, floors in her room were not swept or mopped.  In my room, when I lifted my mattress while spraying the bed, I found a dirty pillow case shoved under it, the drawers in the kitchen were still had some crumbs in them. The floors were not swept and mopped. This all was a very disappointing experience and decided not to book through Expedia again. After driving over 17 hrs to get here who wants to wait 2 hrs before they can get into a room they already reserved ahead of time and paid for already than to be assigned filthy rooms? They were all booked so we were stuck with these rooms. I will be calling Expedia concerning this. I will also be placing this on Extended Stay America's site too.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
578	            I called Expedia to let them know I would be travelling.I also wanted a PIN number so I could withdraw cash.  I had called on August 14th 2017 and asked them about a PIN.  They said they would send me one in USPS mail.  A letter arrived Monday, August 21.  There was instructions on HOW to change my pin number but no temporary pin, which is needed for me to set up a permanent.  I called and asked them where the PIN number was on the letter.  They said I had a FORM to fill out.  NO, it was just a letter.  I asked if they cd email me a pin number, overnight one,  OR fax one to me here at home, and they said NO to all 3 of these.  There was NO ONE there who knew IF my PIN was coming in a separate envelope.  NO ONE KNEW.  Since I am leaving for Europe on the 24th, I didn't think I would have time to get this straightened out.  Called Amazon and they expediated OVERNIGHT a new card with a chip.  Very knowledgeable lady on the phone, very considerate.  GOT MY AMAZON card the day after I called them (received today.)  Don't bother with EXPEDIA.  Use AMAZON.  Those folks are on the ball, EXPEDIA is not.        	                4	1	Tuesday	expedia	neutral
579	            Booked 3 tickets in economy class from Rio de Janeiro to Brasilia for myself and my parents through Expedia on Avianca airlines Brazil. My father has a serious lung and heart problem and due to this was informed by the doctors that he could not fly for the next year. He also had some complications from his stent surgery. We sent a medical note from a doctor to confirm this to Avianca, they refused the refund stating they will only give back 5% of the airfare for the 3 tickets. Expedia was the agency we booked through, they would not help us. I spoke to a supervisor who basically regurgitated what the agent stated, no customer service orientation at all. Avianca is a greedy company with no morals and no heart, avoid them at all costs. Expedia has incompetent staff who couldn't care less. I thank God these tickets were less than $400 USD for all of us, otherwise we could have lost out on thousands of dollars due to Avianca's horribly unfair policy and Expedia's refusal to stand up for us.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

Using Expedia, I booked a car in San Jose, Costa Rica, for $350 at Alamo for a week and also a ""full coverage insurance package"" from Expedia for $88.  I did this months in advance of my trip.  Upon arrival at the car counter, Alamo said they would not honor Expedia's insurance.  It was a bait and switch and super hard upsell.  No real options at that late time.

My Taxes and Fees for a 2 night rental was $204.76!  I've been on the phone with Expedia and the actual hotel multiple times and both parties blame the other for this outrageous add on and both parties agree it's actually an outrageous add on.

I had booked an airline fair using Expedia thru United airlines and purchased the additional ""cancellation plan"" for $19.00.  The ""cancellation plan"" is a classic example of deceptive advertising.  I would have received the same rebate of $0 if I simply did not show up for the flight.

When I contacted the airline they apologised but explained as my transaction was through expedia they would have to refund expedia who would then refund me. After several emails, three calls, including a 36 minute call to a foreign call centre they eventually agreed to refund my flight. That was the end, or so I thought! Almost four weeks later, and despite further communications from me they have yet to refund me. I have now had to take the matter up with my credit card company to act on my behalf and hopefully get my refund.

I followed the directions and canceled the reservation. The day after I was originally going to stay at the hotel I was charged. I contacted the hotel and was told I was logged as a no show. I contacted Expedia and they said because they had no record of the cancellation the hotel could not reimburse me. I asked what they were going to do with this situation since this was the fault of the Expedia website. After being on hold for 15 min. and talking to a manager, I was informed all they could do is give me a $50 Expedia certificate to use on my next booking. I told the gentleman that I was never going to use their website again and that would be useless.

We were not happy with that change and canceled the package.  Expedia assured us we would get a full refund, so far only about 1/2 has been refunded.  We rebooked a package and within the first 24 hours changed one of our flights as we did not have enough time to get through customs, they charged us a fee and said we would be reimbursed, which we were.  Then Expedia rescheduled the flight for the wrong return day again charged use a fee they did refund and now have been charged by the airline for those 2 flights that should have been included in the package.  My husband has spent hours on the phone with them (and there is a communion barrier with everyone that he has spoke to, English is not their first lainguage) and now appears we will have to call them again.

607	            I recently purchased a RT flight (United and Delta) through Expedia.   When I received confirmation several days later, my name was not listed, but another family member's who was not traveling.  I also had purchased two tickets for my children, who have Down Syndrome, and cannot travel alone.  When I noticed the error, I contacted them immediately.  It seems that although I had entered the proper name, the site automatically removed my name as the adult and put my husband's name, which was on our Expedia account but NOT listed for that trip.  I had checked and rechecked prior to booking, to make sure the proper names were listed, and they were.  No confirmation was sent at that time, and after 2 weeks I went hunting for it.  They had also sent the confirmation to my husband's email.  I also had double checked that mine was listed, not his.  When I contacted Expedia, every single person I had contact with spoke broken English to the point that I had to ask them to repeat over and over, and I had to keep correcting what I had said to them.  They told me they could not change the name on the ticket, which I was aware of, as we travel frequently and understand TSA guidelines.  I was requesting a refund so that I could purchase a new flight via the airline so there would be no more mistakes.  The operator argued with me and refused to discuss their culpability in making the mistake and kept defaulting back to blaming it on TSA.  The supervisor (I am not convinced that it was an actual supervisor, as his English was even worse than the first operator.) was equally unhelpful and told me it was not Expedia's problem.  I explained that I would be losing the children's tickets as well, and they said that they weren't responsible for them, either- their names were listed properly.  My husband called the next day, and Expedia's operator was even more rude to him and essentially accused of of attempting some kind of scam.  They have the ability to access all of our keystrokes on the site, and, had they followed up with this, they would see we were telling the truth.  However, when I went back to do that myself, they had deleted the entire thing.  It had been there the day before, and hadn't been removed until I requested they review the info themselves.  Ultimately, I had to go directly to the airlines and purchase the exact same flight at higher prices, so as to not lose my children's tickets as well.  The entire fiasco cost me over $500, and plenty of anxiety.  I have dealt with many travel sites a year, I write travel reviews, and my husband does as well for work related travel.  We were treated with complete disrespect, were lied to, and fleeced for $500.  We were also told we have no recourse to continue to pursue this.  I will never use Expedia again.  At the absolute least, Expedia needs to train their customer service department in how to do their job - and not outsource to people whose English is so terrible, it ceases to be useful in resolving isssues.  They were clearly reading a script.  Avoid Expedia.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative

609	            Expedia has been an absolute nightmare!!! Made reservations on Friday July 28 for Aug. 9th. Some how the reservation got messed up and the reservation was made for the 11th. So I called to have it changed and they have been giving me the run around stating they can not get in touch with the hotel manager to do the changes. I was tired on hearing this and calltge the hotel 5 days later and they informed me that Expedia is not following procedure and should know to email them regarding reservations. I called Expedia back to give the email address and they are still telling me this is going to take another 72 hours. Rediculous!!! My vacation is gonna be here and I'm afraid my room is not going to be available and I'll be out money due to not being able to change or cancel this without Expedia taking the proper steps in contacting the hotels they do business with. Shame on Expedia!! They should know the procedures for dealing with the hotels they have contracts with.        	                2	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
610	            Unfortunately I would give zero stars but that's not an option. We have our one year anniversary on July 30th. So that weekend my husband went through mwr vacations through the government and we used are military star card. Well the hotel we pick was get but the mwr vacation. Gov uses expedia. And we found on our anniversary that my son that is 6 years old will have to buried his biological  father the day of my husband a my getaway so we called t he hotel they had no problem changing the date however since it was booked through expedia we had to call them well they sent us to another department then to another department and gave us a number that does even work. So we called mwr they got a hold of expedia so they say and was told they will keep our 678.00 and cancel our 3 day trip and we will not be able to change. What i don't understand is we are all human you never know when you will die. So how can you not refund or just change a date for someone. Not only did my 6yold father paased but I had to tell him on my anniversary and we will be layijng him to rest the day of my anniversary getaway plus we lost 678.00. I hate expedia in kind horrible ppl. How can you live witgh yourself I will never do business with scum companies like expedia ever again.

611	            Do not buy tickets through Expedia!!!!!!My son bought a ticket to France and the airline agents closed before their scheduled time and expedia refused to refund him or book him on another flight at their costs. It didn't matter that we were at the airport three hours before his flight or that we waited in line at XL Airlines for over 45 minutes, or that we were speaking with the SF Police Department and two supervisors from the information booth at the airlines that kept trying to explain to them that we were there and the security would not let him through. Expedia would not listen or attempt to even assist us. The only thing they kept telling us was that he needs to purchase another ticket.

612	"            Horrible experience with Expedia.I made reservation and called hotel for detail information like it was directed on the website. Hotel didn't have any my information but Expedia keep saying my reservation is confirmed. They didn't have anyway to contact to the hotel and no clear answer until the day before my travel.

613	"            I received a sketchy email the day of my trip saying that my hotel would not be able to accommodate my stay anymore and that I could call Expedia to rebook somewhere else. The email was full of typos and spelling mistakes.  The itinerary number wasn't the one on my booking confirmation and the numbers they listed were all toll numbers.  I thought for sure this was a phishing email so I call the toll free Expedia number listed online to report the fraudulent activity.   When I finally got through to Expedia they told me that the message in the email was correct and that I had to rebook to another hotel.  The only thing was that the only other available hotel was $250 more expensive.  They offered to cover $150 so that I would only need to pay $100.  The only catch was that if I didn't do it right then and there they claimed I would lose the booking all together the credit may not be offered again.  Still uncertain if this was reality or a scam I felt super pressured as I was on my way to the airport.  The agent would not let me speak to her supervisor and after an hour of back and forth I finally agreed that I would pay the money BUT I 100% required a call back from their supervisor when she was available.  ""Oh of course, no problem"".  I never received a call back and was left on a cliff hanger going into the hotel.Turns out it was legitimate and I was booked into the new hotel.  From my perspective this was handled very poorly by Expedia right from the brutal broken English email to the high pressure agent to the no-show supervisor.

614	            I booked a room through Expedia a year ago. Just got an email last night saying that the hotel we had booked couldn't fulfill the request.  Called the hotel and they said they had booked out the rooms for the same weekend every single year at this time for the Festival we are going to and there never were any rooms.  They let Expedia know last week.  Expedia waited to notify.  They are blaming the hotel.  First time trying Expedia, and the LAST.  They wanted to help me find a room.  HA, HA.  Like I would trust them.  Now I have to get a room 45 minutes away at this late notice and more expensive.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	positive
615	            booked a flight a few hours ago with Expedia and they charged me for an insurance that I didn't even asked for. The flight was $91 and the insurance $51. I've sent several emails, called the customer service four times and they were useless. I want to keep my flight and the only thing I want to do is to cancel the travel insurance and have a refund (insurance which I'm pretty sure I said NO, but somehow they manage to charge me anyways) One person on the call center told me the only thing they could do for me was give me a voucher of $30 in my next purchase. I've told him that I was having the worst customer experience ever and the voucher would be useless, once I will never book anything through expedia again. Then I asked for a full refund of my ticket once you can have full a refund if you cancel before midnight. The person once again told me that they couldn't give me the refund because the flight company was now the responsible for Booking. They told me I was the one who choose the travel insurance on the website but is set up automatically If you don't choose anything. And even if I choose (awareness) this option, I got in contact with them and few minutes later to try to cancel the insurance, but it has been hours since then and they don't want to solve My problem. I don't know why I'm obligated to stay with something that I've said so many times I don't want to. the website tricks the clients to choose things because they can get money behind it.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative

This time, it was worse. I made reservations for a flight and a hotel. My flight reservations were canceled the day before my travel. They said that the airline didn't have the travelers information when I remeber entering all the information in. I had to spend about to hours to get the reservation done again. When I got to the hotel, the room was a one bed bedroom and the reservatioin said it was a two bed bedroom. The hotel staff said that they didn't have anything else available. I ended up cancelling the reservation with NO refund because the hotel supervisor had to give the approval for the refund and she wasn't there that day. Staff from Expedia.com said that they would contact the hotel the next day to ask for a refund. I am still waiting for an email or a call...  I had to make a new reservation in another hotel and I, obviously, didn't use expedia this time!        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

That would be fine if only they didn't have us on hold for 2 hours not being able to change the flight to match the days we needed to leave and come back. Once they figured out the flights they charged us a fee! We didn't cancel the flight, we didn't change the day, this wasn't on us but they refused to help us get the fee waived.

622	"            I have used Expedia many times in the past and been pleased with their service.  Recent experience has been horrible and they should be avoided.I recently spent quite a few hours trying to book a round trip first class flight from San Antonio to Philadelphia.  After going through the web booking protocol I got to the secure booking/payment section. After clicking ""book"" a pink box saying ""booking did not go through, try again in a few seconds"" popped up.  After trying again for about 30 minutes without success, I phoned customer service at Expedia and was told that I might need to wait as long as 3 hours!The next day, I tried again with the same problem so phoned customer service to try to complete booking over the phone.  The representative, a lady self-identified as ""Ann"" in Manila, said she could help but wanted to book me for hotel accommodations also.  I explained to her that I had made accommodations in Philadelphia already at low group rates that Expedia would not be able to better.  She wanted to know the total with the Expedia flight rate for first class showing on the internet site and my quote from the hotel.  She then came up with a total $75.00 US cheaper so I told her to go ahead and book me for both through Expedia, which she did.  Later in the day, after receiving my itinerary from Expedia, I noticed with disgust that ""Ann"" had switched me from first class to supereconomy in all four legs of the trip and put me (6feet, 6inches) in middle seats to boot, knowing that I had a back problem and telling me that she would request aisle seats for the flights.  She achieved her competitive price by deceitfully switching me to economy and charging the full undiscounted hotel rate.  If I had not opened and studied my itinerary within 24 hours, I would have been on the hook for the full flight fee.  Fortunately, I was able to cancel the flight, with some effort, and re-book the hotel at the original discounted rate.  The lesson learned here was Expedia was dishonest in their representations to me and wasted a HUGE amount of my time.  I was later able to book the entire flight in first class for about $10 US more with Orbitz in about 10 minutes.  This will be my LAST dealing with Expedia.  Don't let them string you along, too!        "	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
623	            I'd like to share my experience with Expedia.  It was a very expensive and eye opening lesson.  I booked a family vacation for two parties.  I booked my family and my elderly parents.  Everything was fine until the day that I called to book the transportation to our hotel.  The agent on the line assured me that I could safely cancel one room since I booked two for myself and that my husband, myself and my three kids would fit fine in one room.  Since my husband was going to leave us a day early, and I didn't want my kids in a room alone, I cancelled the room.  That's when my nightmare began.  A few days later I looked at the itinerary and it only had two people assigned to our room.  I immediately called Expedia and that's when the runaround began.  I began calling and it was clear that I was calling another country.  Everyone i spoke to had an accent and the background noise was usually people shouting in a foreign language.  It was a series of calling, waiting, getting disconnected, not being called back, calling again, explaining the problem, talking to a manager over and over hour after hour, finally getting a case number, having the over-verified case number not work, explaining again, finally having your case move up the ranks, 4 days later they have reviewed the recordings and the reply is they are willing to do nothing for me.  The manager Will sounded compassionate, but still he couldn't help me.  And, of course I'm not allowed to hear the recordings so I understand I have no recourse. I was so willing to work with them, but they were not. Cut to the end.  After endless hours on the phone, someone named Will cancelled my trip.  He seemed to be refunding almost the right amounts, but then the call was disconnected.  I still had to cancel my parents itinerary, because they are elderly and not fit to travel alone.  I think Will would have refunded the trip, but the call was mysteriously disconnected and I was forced to call back.  They never connect you back to the person who was helping you.  Instead, you have to start from the beginning and you have to explain yourself to an agent who doesn't have the power to help you.  If you want to talk to a manager, you have to wait forever and that usually turns into hours of waiting.  I was exhausted.  I cancelled my parents trip, and it cost me about $1500.00.  Even though I had the more expensive insurance, that's the loss I incurred.  This turned out to be the most expensive and stressful trip I never took.  I see what Expedia does.  They wear you down until you give up.  Just as an example, on one day I spent about 9 hours on the phone.  There were many more days that I dedicated long hours to resolving this problem.  It was always a runaround. Now I realize that it is not safe to trust a human agent because if they make a mistake you have no recourse to defend yourself, and you'll pay a heavy cost.  At least when you book online you can see exactly what you're doing.  Trust nobody and book carefully.  Like many others, I used to think that talking to a person on the phone was more thorough and reliable, but I will never do that again.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
624	            I booked a roundtrip flight last month and received a confirmation email, itinerary email and then marketing emails periodically referencing my itinerary number and the city I am traveling to. Yesterday I logged in and clicked on my itinerary and it says cancelled. I called United directly and they told me that my reservation was cancelled by Expedia. I am very confused as to how I would ever know it had been cancelled without an email to notify me of the cancellation and then to keep sending me emails about my itinerary and trip details... this is very deceiving.I received this email from customer service after speaking with them:Please Kellie,If United say that your ticket is cancel, please call us, the ticket cost is higher now and we want to help you with that, by the way look for your billing statement and send it to this email so we can help you with it and also you need to ask for a supervisor.Thank you for your time!Expedia Customer Service   I spent 2 hours and 20 minutes on the phone with customer service last night (everyone was pleasant and helpful until the end) and when it went to the corporate office to work out payment for getting me back on this flight that you cancelled, Michelle Phillips in Las Vegas took absolutely no responsibility for this, would not even give me any information about how this flight was cancelled (phone, email, website, etc) or if she has any proof at all that this was my fault. She had no real information but refused to take any responsibility for the fact that I am still getting emails referencing my itinerary number and flights... when I am not actually on those flights and that itinerary should be non-existent if I supposedly cancelled my flights. All of the communication I am getting from Expedia says I am on those flights, so how was I supposed to know it was cancelled?This is horrific to me that a company as big as Expedia can't take responsibility for this mistake. I did not cancel this flight and never would - it is a very important trip for me. After dealing with Michelle Phillips at the corporate office refusing to help pay for this ticket (after every other customer service agent apologized for the mistake and wanted to help get this paid for), I will no longer be using Expedia, after years of loyalty. I am appalled how this situation was handled. I went to Travelocity last night and re-booked my trip for this weekend.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

The 1st time I called them it was 10 pm and the rep had me waiting for about 30-40 minutes, when he returned to finally help and direct me, we got cut off.  At that point it was already late and I was too tired to call again. The second time I called I spoke with Matthew, I explained that I had rewards that I wanted to use towards my flight to Montego Bay Jamaica. The total was $61 - he put me on hold over and over and repeated to please hold on that he was coming back and after holding for 45 minutes he stated that he was going to 'walk me through' getting my rewards via the website because he was unable to do it from his end. As he started speaking, again I was cut off.  When I called back, Maria picked up and I repeated my request to which she responded that $61 rewards cannot be used towards my flight because the rewards has to be the same amount of what I pay for the flight. Sounds like BS to me - they claim you have rewards but when you try to use them, they don't apply, Expedia get better customer service, do you even have reps in the US?        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	positive

I was assured that no money would be taken from my account prior. However, 2 days before my stay the full amount was taken from my account. As I had budgeted to pay the hotel to coincide with my pay day this caused me to go over drawn and subsequently receive a £25 non authorised over draft charge.I complained to Expedia, who basically called me a liar and would only offer £25 worth of on line vouchers for their site, this after much debate with 2 separate people spanning over 30 minutes. In the end I politely declined explaining that I'd never use them again.Be careful, this company make false promises, charge you extra for the privilege then don't believe you when you get bank charges through their lies.Total disgrace of a company.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative

Yesterday on the 11th July I receive a email saying they were changes to my flight! Then I saw the status said cancel. Called customer service ,One person said how the airline change the coat of the flight, Really? ?????????? Called again another said they were a problem with the ticket.

645	"            I wish I could give 0 stars. Expedia is the worst ever company and never, ever will I use expedia again. I booked 1st class rail travel to London, from Liverpool as part of a surprise for my parents.  I received my itinerary via email, which in all fairness did state that in bold that in order to retrieve  my train tickets I must bring the original credit card I used to purchase them. However, in the meantime, I'd had my purse stolen along with my credit card. This is where the bad review comes in. I contacted the ticket office at lime street and they advised me that expedia will be able to change the card details on their system as I am, of course, not the only one this has happened to and big companies should take in to account situations like this. So, I contact expedia and was my call was answered by a foreign lady whose attitude stunk. She was huffing and puffing, shouting at me and even at one point nearly cancelled my travel arrangements all together. I could understand if I was being awkward, but I was calm and explained the situation politely. This was when she said ""I'm going to ring my husband, as I can't speak good enough English to help you"".  After speaking to her husband she came back to tell me ""we're not helping you, and don't even ask for a refund as you won't get one"", Then just hung up. Thank God for the Virgin Train staff at Lime street for using their discretion when I produced ID and going above and beyond to help us when they didn't have to.

No matter how far in advance you give them (literally months) to cancel a refundable trip they will cancel and refund only 30% of your money after promising 75%.

Time 1000 PM, EST. Description: IVR promptly directed it me to input my cc number, choose 1 or 2 for the language of your preferences. 10 minutes later the IVR keeps telling about the long waits15 minutes later the journey still continue on hold. I was wondering how many people are calling at this hours, what is expedia average seep of answer(ASA) because my call in their queue is killing their services level. Anyway who am I to judged is my first time maybe things are not like this ever. Maybe I am unlucky today. 45 minutes waiting I started to be concerned about the waiting. am I going to go on vacations or WHAT? BTW I could have done this online but I preferred to speak with a humane being. Finally chapter 2This guy answer the phone very polite and with that motivation energy-given. I need two things just 2. one was to book the same flight I already had look and redeem my points. 35 minutes and this person is still searching for the flight that I wanted to take. FYI the prices of the ticket was 487.87 Canadian - 250 dollar worth of points. Perfect prices for a 10 days vacations. After all this hard work comes the part when you are happy and ready to booked your cheep flight. This person tells me that my name is to long and he can't book my flight. Never hear this in my life.This is when I realized that my perfect vacation are about to go to the garbage. Chapter 3 ""Great recommendation"" Call the bank and check your namecall directly the airline and booked with themotherwise calls us back laterChapter 4 Called the bank to fixed my name and make it shortercalled the airline and they told me that I can short one of my name and all with be fine. Chapter 5 I called back TDExpedia. On this second call this person was more knowledgeable and told the same as the airline told me. what is the wrong part about this call is that my ticket went up by 300 dollars. nobody cant do something about it. this is already 3 hours of my day on the phone. Chapter 6 Courtesy After explained that is not my fault that expedia agent was not able to book my flight and they should owner me the prices of my original ticket. (damn do something inside my head) they offered me a voucher of 50 dollars for a hotel.  Chapter 7 Do it alone - ""Just do it""I decide to booked my flight online without any human intervention finally. (Be brave).I completed my booking in 5 minutes. Geez it was that easy. Well not really. After I booked and paid fort my flight I received my reservation in an email and my name has letters missing (are you kidding). Chapter 8 Canada day 150 birthday - (Long Weekend) Despite the fireworks and the celebrations in the city. I am waiting for Monday to call back TDExpidia and fix my name. 30 minutes waiting (Oh not this happening again) and finally 3er agent to speak with. I EXPLAINED all over again. (she can see it the note) .1 hour in the phone with her between hold and bla bla. She cant FIXED my name I need to call the airline and pay 150 Canadian to ""FIX"" my name. (HOLD down to fast)  why would I PAY something that your system screwed up. I request to speak with her supervisor for more help. Chapter 9 The end of the callSupervisor on the line with me. Monday after long weekend 900 AM. she told me that she is aware of my situation. But her first question was ""Why didn't you call early to fix your issue?"" I said really!!!! how much early do you want me to call you back. after chat, chat and bla bla about my fault she told me that she will back track my activities on my account. Ok go a head and see that I TRIED to fixed the problem at 2 am on Friday. Thank you. 10 minutes on hold and she comes back and offered me to pay the 150 dollars charge that the airline is charging to ""FIX"" my name. she sent me an email to reply her back with the receipt showing my pay to the airline. Well my part is done is wasn't my fault nether their fault was a system issue. understandable. The end. Chapter 10 me with aeromexico phone rings 2 minutes later someone answer and within 2 minutes of my explanation the agent on the phone told me that I DON'T need to pay 150 dollar to change my name. the issue is a system issue and my name is to long apparently. however aeromexico needed to added a note on my reservation and problem solve. After 3 hours of pain and bad customer services with TDExpedia my problem could have been solve by adding a note to my reservation. I could have save money and time. TDExpidia please train your agents and supervisor to improve the speed of the calls, customer satisfaction  and most importantly to save you money.

652	            Used expedia for first time and one hell of a experience. I dont even want to give them one star.   From flight to room. I just wasted my money and trusted expedia to help me with good deal and beautiful stay.   They are big rip off.. United plane sucks big time and so as expedia. While flying back,  we had plane around 2.20pm but the plane was early at 11.00am. They didnt even email us or let us know. We were early for our 2.20 flight. When checked with the united personal in the airport, we were told that its expedia fault that they need to inform us. But we did not receive any email from them. When we called expedia, it was a total turn off other then sorry they did not help us  at all. Now our flight was 5.10pm and also delayed ti 5.45pm.  Now when it comes to the hotel, the Townhouse in miami ,i have no idea kinda hotel is it. Water leaking from the roof, when i came back at night to the room, i see water all over in the bathroom , i called the front desk, he came and checked, and then he got towel with him to put it on the floor, he told us he will give us another room. He did even bother, the window blinds came off, no bath towel in the room, need to call and ask for everything. And the tricky part is that, they dont give you full detail on the website or call, ur caught off guard, and u end up paying extra from thr hotel fee. It  is never a convenient  hotel to stay. They dont have pool, we got to go to other hotel which they merged with. They say they have own chair and stuff on the beach,  thats a lie, when u reach thay place, u end up paying for beach umberalla, chair and stuff.. which is super expensive.It was worst experience with expedia.

655	"            Expedia is an absolutely horrible company. DO NOT USE THEM! I just spent 3 hours on the phone with customer service and was transferred to 5 different people for absolutely no reason other than each was poorly trained than the one before, and eventually I was transferred to the corporate office to speak with a Rachel Green aka John Smith, a ""manager"", who said that there was nothing that could be done about my issue.Long story short, I had booked a flight with XL Airways from Paris CDG to San Francisco SFO last August 2016 through Expedia. XL Airways is also a horrible airline which I highly recommend you do NOT use, as well as Expedia - my partner and I booked our XL Airway flights through Expedia, and had accidentally inserted our names backwards - surname first, first name last. Quick fix right? Wrong. We get to the airport CDG to head back to SFO, and as we are checking into our flights, XL Airways representatives tell us we can't board our flights since our names were  inputted backwards on our boarding passes, contrary to the names on our passports. We call XL Airways customer service at the airport to quickly sort this small mistake out - turns out they are closed on the weekends, which is when our flight was scheduled on. We ended up having to rebook our flights THROUGH Expedia, when we had initially booked through them for our first flights. We headed home to SFO, disappointed, but were told by Expedia we had credit for the initial fights that we could redeem within a year.Circling back to our airline credit, we were told we would be able to use our $1800 flight credit with XL Airways, as long as we paid $175 booking fee per person. I called today requesting to redeem said credit, and was put on hold multiple times for over 2 hours, then transferred to 5 people total, with no explanation why I was being transferred. Two hours of this occurred, until I was transferred to Rachel at the ""corporate"" office of Expedia, who told me that our $1800 credit of XL Airways is lost, and all she can offer me is a $100 hotel credit through Expedia. Really Expedia? This is the absolute worst customer service I have ever received, and to be offered something so embarrassingly low from ""corporate"" to replace the $1800 we are potentially losing in airline credit is a massive disappointment to us. I asked why, if Expedia knew that XL Airways was such an unreliable airline, that they would use them on their platform as we only discovered them through Expedia's search engine. Rachel doesn't know anything. Rachel is disappointing. All in all, I think Expedia is the worst company to use, as we have used Priceline in the past, and when an issue occurred through Priceline, Priceline refunded us in FULL + EXTRA to make up for the inconvenience. In conclusion, use Priceline and your troubles will be behind you in one short phone call to their customer service.Expedia is absolutely awful.        "	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

Expedia neglected to inform the establishment of our confirmed reservation. We were frantic. Previously booked another room at another establishment and after a few hours of trying to get Expedia to accommodate our reservation that establishment gave us a room near our advance booking price. Expedia called back finally and all they would offer was a $200 coupon for a future booking. This is the second time they have seriously screwed up a long awaited trip for our family. The last one was a return flight from Hawaii. Fool me twice...  Never again, Expedia. Warning, use another booking agency or go directly to the establishment.

Followed their process for issuing a complaint...received an acknowledgement to say complaint will be dealt with in 10 days...but still waiting some 17 days later.  Tried to follow up by the UK help line...but just get transferred to various call centres in India.  Spent hours on the phone trying to get an answer to complaint......but can never get hold of anybody who may be accountable and who can make a decision.  Received numerous promises for a call back within 24 hours....but never made!!  Am now giving up.....would never do business with them again....may be cost cutting to locate call centres in India....but perhaps Expedia should consider loss of business instead by running such a shambles from there.

I'm still not sure what I paid for through Expedia for this car rental.

662	"            I recommend NOTHING about using Expedia. We booked an entire baseball team and their families (10 families) to a resort in Panama City Beach, Florida. For most, they didn't have many problems. One family arrived and the room wasn't clean nor were the beds made but that isn't Expedia's fault. However, 2 families had bugs in their room, it looked like a crime was committed in the carpet in their rooms. Again, that's not Expedia's fault. The two families went to the front desk and the people at the resort were apologizing and trying to find rooms at the same resort or a sister resort but they had none. This is where it comes to Expedia. We notified them of the problem and that they had no more rooms to move us too. After a 4 hour continuous phone call (yes that's actual time that showed up on the iPhone counter) and being transferred to i dont know how many people we still had no answer. We had 4 adults, 2 13 year olds and an 11 year old that were sitting outside in their cars while on hold and no place to go. Finally after WE found a resort that had a room and we told the lady from Expedia which resort could accommodate us, she told us that we had to pay her the for the room BEFORE she could book it. We had already paid for the room with bugs but we still had to pay for this one BEFORE she would even call them! It's 9pm and we are sitting in a car with no place to go so of course we gave her the credit card number and after she screwed that up a couple times, we finally had a room FOR THE NEXT NIGHT!!! We told her we still needed a room for the current night. She again put us on hold and came back and said she could get us one smoking room with a king bed...for 7 people. I told her that we would find our own rooms (as if we hadn't done all the work already) for that night. We found two rooms at another hotel and reserved it and started the drive over to the hotel and the lady from Expedia (yes we were still on hold with her) came back on and told us she had the reservations for the next night and NOW she had already booked us two rooms with 2 queen beds as the same resort we would be staying in for the next week. I told her that since she had told us she could only get us one room AND that I told her earlier that we would find our own room, we wouldn't be needing the two rooms for that night. The Expedia lady started crying, and put me on hold AGAIN. I remained calm and checked us into the hotel where my 13 year old could get a shower, eat and go to bed (in the 3rd hotel we had paid for). The Expedia lady comes back on the phone and tells me that Expedia will have to ""eat"" the cost of the rooms she reserved for that night since ""I wouldn't live up to my word""! WHAT? Was she serious??? At this time we had a hotel and I hung up and we slept. The next day we went to check-in at the new hotel. The reservations were there, kind of. They had us down for only needing one room but the hotel staff quickly fixed that. All is good now, right? WRONG!!! The hotel asked us for payment! We have paid Expedia for the original resort, we paid them for the second resort, we paid for our own room for one night and now the new resort wanted payment? Come to find out, the Expedia lady called the hotel herself (didn't go through Expedia's reservation department) but didn't give them payment for anything EXCEPT the two rooms she reserved after we had already told her we found our own place. So...another call to Expedia from the hotel lobby. The hotel manager was FANTASTIC. If it wasn't for him, I'm sure we'd have been sleeping with friends for a week. The ONLY way we could get payment for the rooms from Expedia was that the hotel records all incoming calls. The hotel staff found the 2 calls from the Expedia lady (each one was over 30 minutes long). They finally found the part where she gave the ""virtual credit card"" number. He then used that card number to get payment. He told us that this is normal for Expedia. They don't expect people to stay on the phone for that long (for us we were on the phone for 4.5 hours the first day and 1 hour and 56 minutes the second day). Finally after he got authorization for the rooms, I hung up so who knows how long I'd have been on the phone. Expedia finally did call back and we asked them about refunding the money for the first night (the room with the bugs) and he said he'd have to wait until Monday to see if they could refund it. Guess what, it's Sunday now. Almost a week later and no call about any of this. This company has operators all over the world. They put you on hold, switch you to as many people as they can only to get you to hang up. I can assure you that I will NEVER use Expedia again nor will the other members of my family or the other families on our ball team (and we travel a lot for tournaments). This was over 6 hours of time of our vacation with us, and our children worried that we may not find a place to stay. We wasn't able to stay with the rest of the team, which we realize that Expedia isn't responsible for the cleanliness of the properties but they are the money people! Trust me, our money will go to a much better place than Expedia on future trips.        "	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	positive

664	            Expedia.com is probably one of the worst customer service I've encountered!! I haven't had much problem with them until recently. And, boy, it's a headache to have Expedia resolve a simple mistake that they had made! When booking a flight, it is critical to get the names correct. So,I painstakingly made sure all of our names reflected what were shown on our passports. But as the travel date approached, I wanted to confirm our reservation with the airline just to make sure everything was in order. The airline sent me the e-tickets, and this is when I found out that our baby's name was incorrect. I asked the agent to correct it, but she said this had to be done by the travel agency. I didn't understand what happened. On Expedia itinerary, my little one's name was correct. But, that wasn't the case on the e-ticket.. I called Expedia a few times to get this resolved, and the attitude of one of the reps that I spoke with was appalling! She said that I HAD to be patient. Um, excuse me? I think she owes me an apology for the mistake that Expedia made. But instead, I have her telling me in a command tone that I need to be patient. The excuse I heard was that they have a high volume of calls. While that may be true, they need to attend to the customer's problem immediately if there's an urgency. I have to say that I'm gravely turned off by their lack of courtesy and attentiveness. I will NOT book my flight through them going forward.**Update: Expedia did NOT change the name even when I was told that a case was made and was promised that it will be taken care of before my departure date. Luckily, my baby was able to take the flight because she is a dual citizen, and we were able to prove that her middle name was omitted from her e-ticket. But, there was another hurdle-- getting the name fixed before returning home. Leaving from the U.S. would have been hard had the AIRLINE not changed the name. What EXPEDIA couldn't do, the airline did in the States in less than a day. Just like that! Never ever book a flight with EXPEDIA!!        	                11	1	Friday	expedia	positive

And they said it's not listed on the website and it's not important to have air conditioning. I checked your website, hotel with four star rated does not mention air conditioning as well. Does that mean the four star hotel doesn't have air conditioning?! It's outrageous. You are clearly lying about the rating and nobody should trust you ever! I would've rated 0 star if I could. Expedia is going out of the business. They don't care about customers' trust at all.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive
666	            On 26 January 2017 I arranged a rental vehicle in Bordeaux (France) through Expedia.co.nz for the period 11-24 May. The total sum of the arrangement was NZ$399.54 and the contract specifically mentions that all taxes and fees are included, as well as unlimited kilometers. On arrival at Bordeaux I was told that km's are not unlimited, that I had to pay an additional fee of 75 euro for driving in Spain and that Goldcar basically didn't care about the confirmed (and printed) agreement I had with Expedia. I accepted the vehicle under protest of the added conditions and immediately informed Expedia about this situation by email. Communications between myself and Expedia have been extensive, but completely unsatisfactory with vague promises to sort things out or, more usual, sending me completely irrelevant (copy &amp; paste) replies.When returning the vehicle to Goldcar the car was inspected (no damage) and, despite asking for a receipt, was told that this was it and she (the person accepting returned vehicles) had no means to give me any written evidence.Upon return to NZ, I found that an amount of $609.43 had been debited from my VISA card; $209.89 more than the agreed and confirmed price in the contract.I immediately contacted Expedia and got no serious response despite and exchange of over 20 emails (apart from saying they are working on the issue, asking for my understanding and I should hear back in 24 hours, etc.). One month later I have got no further; not even received a receipt specifying the costs I paid for.Finally, sick of the fraudulent behavior of rental car companies and their brokers, I opened a case through the NZ Court system, but the simple request of giving the accused's address details and name of contact person I can't fulfill as Expedia refuses to give this most basic of information (try to find Expedia's physical address!).As I have had issues with overseas rental companies in the past, I specifically chose a NZ based travel agent to arrange this vehicle rental, expecting not having to face similar issues as in the past - this proved not to be the case.        	                4	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
667	"            If you can find a deal on a ticket through Expedia then that's cool, good for you. But be well warned, if you have any issue that requires their support you may find yourself very disappointed.I made the mistake of buying a couple plane tickets that I needed changed. I contacted the airline and they had a policy that allowed tickets to be fully refunded within 24 hours, and were also happy to make the requested changed.However they could not because the ticket had been purchased through Expedia and they directed me to speak with them. And for the record Expedia clearly states their policy is that they will not add any charges for any changes to tickets, and will defer to the policy of the airline.I called Expedia's support line, explained the issue, and then was put on hold while they tried to call the airline. After waiting a while I was advised the airline (that I'd just spoken with) weren't answering the phone. Okay.. A little odd..I was advised that ""offline support"" would take over resolving my case and I should expect to hear back from them within 24 hours.I never heard back from them.I sent Expedia a couple more messages requesting an update and support. I submitted the form to escalate the issue. According to their site they ""review it and contact you within 72 hours"".I never heard back from anyone at Expedia. I have no idea if they tried anything but they certainly never tried to assist me.We bought a second pair of plane tickets from another airline directly and had to leave our tickets unused. Complete waste of money.Do not use Expedia if you can help it. You will be far better off going directly to the airlines and hotels. It may be a bit more work to research, but the cost is the same if not better. And most importantly the customer service is worlds better. Expedia didn't just fail us with their customer service, they abandoned us altogether. We were their customer, we paid them for a product that could not be used. They completely disregarded their policies. There is no excuse for that.        "	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive

After 8 hours of total phone time, I was able to obtain a credit for future use ($585) but will be charged an additional $400 for the reissue of (2) 1 way tickets...because it was ""cheaper"" says Expedia. Never, NEVER book with Expedia...go directly to the source...Delta said that a round trip ticket would have been cheaper and if any changes needed to be made, it would have only been a $50 charge.

677	            Used Expedia to book a room this past weekend and it was the worst experience of my life. I've always used this service but never again. They need to investigate the hotels that they put on there website. This one was very deceiving and a miserable weekend. We went to Jackson Miss. for a funeral. Found a room at Extended Hotel Suites. It was late when we arrived so it was easy to see everything but it looked okay from outside. Drove to the location and guys were hanging outside. Went inside and it was freezing. Beds looked horrible, mattress had dips in them with raggedy blankets. Lamps, drawers, TV remote and door latch was broken. Sofa sleeper look like it came from off the corner where someone dumped it. Floor, walls, ceiling looked like they haven't swept or mopped in ages. Wires hanging out of ceiling light fixture. Bathroom fan was gross looking. No coffee machine as stated. We had no choice but to stay there because of the time we arrived there and could not get a refund. Left and went to the funeral, came back and no room service was done. Went to the office and person in staff said that there were no sheets &amp; towels available. Also, the day staff had lied and notated that over service was declined by us. Remind you that we were miles away and gone all day. So long story short, we were left out looking for a place to sleep that night. Never again. On top of that, the cost was extremely high. It wasn't even worth $19.95.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
678	"            I've been renting hotels through Expedia for about six years. I switched to Expedia from Priceline, whom I had a credit card with for my travel needs, but ended my relationship with after too many extremely negative, dangerous hotel experiences. Expedia promised to be different, but, sadly, turned out to be very similar.In the past, after a particularly dangerous hotel stay, I've contacted Expedia and spoken with their customer service managers. To be fair, they've always been polite. However, all signs of effectiveness stop there. About two months ago, our family headed to LA and found a good deal for a hotel on the Expedia site. On getting to the hotel, however, it was clear to us we were in the middle of gang territory. We even saw a young man lingering at the entrance to the hotel with the handle of a gun exposed from his pants. We called Expedia to let them know, filled out a thorough report, and two months later have never heard back from the corporate team we were promised would contact us. As we shared with the Expedia ""customer service manager,"" our complaint was not concerning money, but rather consumer safety. And this past Saturday 10 June 2017, again I rented a hotel in north LA. On arriving, I found the climate control was old and broken. On a warm summer day, there was only heating in our room. Human hairs littered our bedding. I had a medical team meeting at 8AM in the morning at a nearby medical center for which I had to prepare a lecture. I always select ""high-speed Internet access"" as a filter when I choose a hotel room because I'm invariably working when I travel. The hotel had none despite advertising it had. There was a drug bust at the hotel--swat cars, handcuffed people... And at 9:30PM I got mugged and brutalized. Frightened and unable to work, I checked out of the hotel at 2AM. I called Expedia to tell them about my experience, talking with a ""customer service manager"" again. She appeared apologetic, promising to share the experience with management. But nothing has come of the incident. Nor will anything, I'm convinced. Even though police records will show that there was an arrest at the hotel that evening AND a guest mugging, Expedia won't do anything about the hotel. And while, to be fair, Expedia has offered me small coupons for heinous hotel experiences in the past (usually concerning UNSAFE hotels), as I've continually let them know, we don't really care about the cash. We care about the safety of our family. But Expedia acts, instead, as if they have no control whatsoever over the quality of the hotels they do business with.We thought by booking our travel plans through these large companies (Expedia.com is a parent company of SEVERAL online travel companies), we would be protected regarding truth in advertising and safety. But even spending $250+ a night, the quality of hotels is abysmal, and safety is OFTEN circumspect, at best. Complaining to Expedia has done no good as each of these hotels remains active on the Expedia website. It seems to our family now that this poverty of quality has become commonplace BECAUSE there is no travel company that takes deceptive, dangerous hotels to task, and therefore, such facilities are emboldened NOT to change.Shame on Expedia for facilitating the fleecing of US travelers and its disregard for consumer safety. We refuse to do business with this company (or Priceline) ever again. We'd MUCH rather pay significantly more for a reliable and safe experience--which, it seems, requires consumers to return to the traditional word-of-mouth advertising format AND to visit facilities ourselves before committing, and then to review facilities and leave these reviews online for other consumers to read in advance. The large companies like Expedia simply don't care about consumer experiences, even when these are downright dangerous.        "	                6	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

Tried a third time and eventually reached a human, who put me on hold and then disconnected....  I am not sure if I should think that this company is incompetently run or fraudulent.

683	            So there I was, booking but a small hotel nearby. As I usually review everything in English I took no note of the website location. (It was Ireland and I'm dutch) Wow I felt stupid. Paid up front and when I got my initirary I saw the dates were all wrong. Still not sure what I did wrong... so I called the local expedia. Due to regulations they could not change the booking and I had to change at the Ireland office. So called them.They were very quick to find me the correct booking date with the same hotel and called me back for payment info (it sadly was a bit more expensive, but a very reasonable fee from the hotel, not expedia) so within 3 calls I was re booked with all the issues resolved and/or paid for. New initirary sent within minutes. A very welcome experience! Unfortunately they appeared to be based in India or the likes, otherwise I would have send some flowers as well! (Yes I'm silly enough for that)In short: a very nice experience and mistakes made by a moron customer very nicely resolved. And if you did not have my experience: know that the poor people have to work through a very silly built computer system which can frustrate them even more than it can frustrate you and polite and friendly customers get allot further than if you answer already angry. :)        	                1	5	Friday	expedia	negative
684	            Never have I ever felt so mistreated from a company.On feb 2, I booked with ExpediaforTD because I had a TD Travel Rewards Visa and wanted to redeem my points which came up to $477.  I had called an agent to help guide me in the booking.  He found a flight that I was interested in (May 6 flying to Ho Chi Minh and returning to Toronto on May 23) however I found the same flight but a lot cheaper on a different website.  He told me about the price guarantee program they have which could match the same price as the competitive’s website.  I asked him when would I get back the difference and he stated 7-10 business days.  I asked him again, would I be getting the money back right away and he said yes.  Before I went ahead with the booking, I told the agent that I would like to book the flight myself online but he repeatedly insisted to book it for me.  I asked him multiple times that if he were to book it for me, I want to redeem all of my td travel points and he said he will do it.  He then went ahead with the booking for me and all was well….or so I thought.A couple days later I called customer service to see why my td points balance was still $477 and looked like it had no been redeemed.  The agent I spoke with told me it may take a couple of more business days for the redemption to reflect.  I said no worries and continued to wait patiently.On feb 23, I checked my points balance and it was still $477.  At this point I called TD customer service and told them about my situation.  The TD representative stated to me that the agent DID NOT redeem my points during the booking and therefore I could not redeem the points anymore.  The TD representative then had to call ExpediaforTD on my behalf and had to rectify the situation for me so I could redeem the points to which she did.  This is very frustrating because I had told the agent multiple times that A) I wanted to book it myself and B) I wanted to redeem my points and to make sure my points were redeemed for the booked flight.After my conversation with the TD representative ended, I called ExpediaforTD and asked them what was going on with the difference I was promised for the flight.  She then told me that I would be getting back the difference AFTER my return from the flight.  Again, very frustrating because not only did the agent not provide me accurate information about the price match program, but now I would have to pay interest on my credit card for 4 months because of this.  I told the supervisor that I was speaking to that this wasn’t what the agent told me initially and would like to request for the difference back before my flight.  She then told me she would playback the recording of the initial agent’s conversation with me to confirm and would contact me back within 72 hours.  No one contacted me.  Not through e-mail or phone.Fast forward to June 7.  It is now pass the 7-10 business day deadline of the promised price difference and at this point I’m beyond frustrated by the misleading and false information provided to me from the company.  I called again and spoke to someone and told them about my situation and requested to have the difference returned to me immediately.  The agent told me she spoke to her supervisor and promised to refund me the difference by the end of the day.It is now June 8 and I have lost my patience.  I called and requested to speak to a supervisor immediately to rectify this situation once and for all.  Once I reached a supervisor (His name is Wael), I told him my story from the beginning so he can understand where my stress and frustration is coming from.  While telling him my experience, he cut me off and told me he just posted the return for me and gave me the $50 credit coupon for my next booking.  I then asked him why did I have to call so many times to deal with this and why wasn’t the difference issued to me by the promised date and  he told me the company would always honour their promise, repeatedly rebuffed my questions and was very short with me.  If they did “honour their promise”, then I would have received my refund within 7-10 business days like they “promised”.  Instead of helping me or showing some empathy about my situation, he started arguing with me.  Since he could not help me, I asked for him to transfer me to someone else and he stated that if I wanted to speak to someone else, I have to hang up and call again.  I asked him again “As a supervisor, you cannot transfer me to someone else?” to which he replied “Believe me, If i could transfer you I would have a long time ago”.  Not only did he not try to understand my situation or show any empathy, but he had the nerve to say that to me and continue to be rude and disrespectful.  I then called back and spoke to an agent and asked him if supervisors can transfer calls to someone else.  He told me supervisors can definitely transfer calls to corporate to escalate situations.  Not only did Wael act extremely rude to me and unhelpful, he flat out LIED to me and made me call back.  I am now awaiting to speak to a manager from corporate and have been on hold for 1 hour and 15 mins.  I will never recommend this to my colleagues, friends and family about this company.  This has to be by far the WORST customer service I have ever experience and I will make sure to warn everyone before they book anything with ExpediaforTD.  I will also report this to the Better Business Bureau and suggest TD to partner with another company that has competency and not treat clients how your company and employees have treated me.  I will also cancel my TD Travel Rewards Visa since I now have no interest in ever using ExpediaforTD ever again.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	positive

The night before she flew I went on to book her seat preference and realised she had been booked to fly to Dallas Texas! Obviously this caused her a lot of upset and anxiety. But the reason I am leaving 5 stars is because of how it was all dealt with after this mistake was found. I called Expedia at 1030pm and they quickly rebooked my mum on a flight the next morning to Washington, they initially charged her the difference but said this would be refunded after a 48 hour investigation period if they were at fault, which it was. Yes a human error was made, but they dealt with everything efficiently and professionally.

During my request, I asked if there was additional discounts and was told that there were NO additional discounts. When I checked into the Towne Place in  Tallahassee, FL that there was an additional discount if I was going  to the Capital Medical Center Hospital. The Desk Staff told me that the rate would have been $74. Vs. the $118. rate charged by Expedia, plus my request for a handicap room was not on the reservation (I was lucky, they had a handicap room). Shame on Expedia for overcharging and secondly for farming out the call center to cheaper labor overseas.        	                3	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
696	            I cancelled my flights a week ago, the customer service told me I will get the authorized amount back within 72hours.I called in after 3 days to reconfirm if my refund is coming back, then customer service told me I'll get the money by the morning of next day and sent my a confirmation email. But I have never get my money back. When i followed up today again, I was told that my refund was NOT PROCESSED AT ALL!!! This does not make sense to me in any point of view, then customer service told me I need another 7 days to get my money back. I was so sad about the my experience this time, I need my money RIGHT NOW instead of waiting for another 7 days. They are making me feel like I will never get my money back. The customer service calls provided me different information, wrong dates, different excuses everytime I called. They put me on hold for several hours coming back and forth but never solve my problem.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

For example at the hotel there's parking fee as well as other hidden fees. Singles with the car as well as to flight baggage is not included so that's additional fee apart from what you have already paid period so the cost and total is not even the price that you pay because when you go to the flight or the hotel or even so the car they will charge additional fees not included in the total bill already posits.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	neutral

702	            Booked Upper Class seats on flights with Virgin Atlantic through Expedia at the cost of $9,851 but were forced to cancel. We were given credit for the full amount and advised that there would be a reissue fee of $500 each. When we rebooked the total cost of the new flights was $7,752. We were force to pay the $1,000 fee, so in total it cost us $,10,852...more than $3,000 over  and above the value of the seats. Shameful!! I asked the Expedia operator if we had any redress and was told to contact Virgin Atlantic direct. Which I did, but they advised that refund requests must be processed by the agent...in this case, Expedia. I have now emailed your customer services twice, but still await the simple courtesy of a reply. It seems that your people are trained to pass the buck and in so doing give customers the run around. Not a good way to treat people. Incidentally, the seats we originally booked and paid handsomely for were all sold again.

704	            I booked a suite through Expedia for a business trip that I am going on in May and right off the bat they asked for a security deposit of $300. I thought it was a little odd because they wanted to hold onto it for 2 months prior to my stay. I tried calling and emailing ''N2N Suites - Heart of the City - Downtown'' Suite multiple times and received no response back for a MONTH. I then reached out to Expedia to explain how sketchy I felt about this booking and asked for a refund. They then told me the only way they could refund me is they have to reach N2N Suites to obtain approval for this.The thing is they keep calling the numbers and email that was provided to me and obviously received no answer. I keep asking them what happens if they never contact you and they always give me the same answer. We can' refund you until we speak to them. Talk about the definition of insanity....doing something over and over again expecting a different result.One of the representatives I talked to got frustrated that I wanted a different answer and he told me to go the accommodation the day of and then see what happens? Then I said the last thing that I want to do is try and see if I can get into my suite after no response on their end for 2 months the day I arrive in Toronto for business. I went ahead and booked another accommodation because clearly Expedia is not doing anything about this and I have to figure this out myself.I may lose out on $200 but I wanted to WARN others who are traveling to Toronto be weary booking with N2N Suites - Heart of the City - Downtown Suite. Just even read the reviews on Expedia...

709	"            Bought the insurance that guarantees you can get a refund for all services (rental car, hotel, and airfare).  But, didn't notice that the wording in the insurance says that it will refund ""up to 100%"".  Of course, when our plans changed and we tried to get a refund with the ""Trip Protection Plan"" that we purchased at $40 per traveler, we found out that we would get reimbursed $0 for our flight because the airline policy that Expedia bought the tickets through states that there are no refunds.  And, the small print in the protection plan says that Expedia will only reimburse what the airline policy would reimburse anyway.  So, just like that, we were out $1200.  Yes, always read the small type.  But, there is no doubt that Expedia's business practices are unethical, and extremely customer unfriendly.

They sent me to the airport 30 minutes away and said they would exchange it for me. Once I got there I was told they do not exchange cars. I got on the phone with both Expedia and Enterprise and they were both worthless and did not care about helping me.

Once a week since the middle of March, I spend a minimum of 4 hours a week on the phone trying to find out the ""status"" of the refund. Each time I am told that ""someone did not send a email to the right department and I should see that refund within 24-48 hours"". Diego, Mark , Ryan, nor Maggy have been any assistance and speaking with Jordan at Expedia CORPORATE today only wasted another 2 hours of my life. Only a certain department can refund but no one is smart enough to do so??? I contacted the complaint department for ""escalated issues"" and was told 24-48 hours for response......NOPE...that was 8 days ago.. Your recording is constantly asking me for a review so here ya go :Expedia YOU SUCK. Being a GOLD member has absolutely no benefits, your customer service is the WORST I have ever seen,you owe me $16k , all of my Expedia points back, compensation for my 32 hours spent on the phone trying to resolve this and most of all AN APOLOGY !!!!

Even though the site failed to book, I have two pending charges amounting to over $1100.00 on my credit card from the airline. I cannot use my credit card to successfully book until the funds are released, so I called Expedia's CS department and they were not willing to help, and tried to give me excuses about ""the prices were being updated"" and that's why the system failed.  I refreshed my search and the prices were exactly the same.  Additionally, I was given conflicting information about how long it would take for the charges on my card to be released. I told them I still need to book this flight and my concern is that when the funds are released and I try to book, the prices will have gone up and I would have to pay more because of their website error.  I should not have to face consequences because their website failed.  No one would provide any kind of help or benefit for the inconvenience I am facing (i.e. like guaranteeing me the current price of the ticket when my funds are released, or giving me a voucher or discount), so I will be taking my business elsewhere from now on.

I realized later that we were being charged an additional hotel night (the night we end up leaving) and that our layover was much longer than realized.  Fine, an oversight on my part.  I tried accessing the airline to see if we could adjust our flights (and I also had to request a vegan meal), but no flights with my confirmation number on them could be found.  Expedia states that all adjustments/specifications must be made through the airline, BUT THE AIRLINE states that I must do this through Expedia.  How do I guarantee that I can eat the food on this 30+ hr trip???  Issue two, our confirmation listed the wrong dates (essentially saying that we'd be at the layover destination for 8 days and in Bali for 1).  Probably a typo, but I still can't get anyone from Expedia to confirm that this is just a slip up on their part. Issue three, my travel partner is unable to access our itinerary through the ap and online and isn't receiving any of the updates/confirmations.After 45 minutes on hold, I finally reached a customer service rep who was confused more than half the time... resulting in her trying to book us an ADDITIONAL trip, change things that shouldn't be changed, and just adding overall more stress to the situation.

739	"            Dear Expedia:I have been an Expedia customer for many years and have always been delighted to book my trip through you. My loyalty has been shaken, however, by a recent frightening and potentially dangerous experience involving myself. 	On March 29, 2017, I was driving from Newark New Jersey to Orangeburg South Carolina. When I arranged her hotel reservation, it was so that I can attend my mother memorial services.  I called to the Baymont Hotel to inform them that I will need a late check-in. However, I was informed by the hotel representative that I do not have any reservation for March29, 2017. I immediately called Expedia to resolve this matter.  I was speaking to a representative who informed me that my reservation was for March 28, 2017 and checking out was on March 29, 2017. The represent put me on hold so that he can call the hotel. After speaking with the hotel the representative from Expedia said I will have to pay to stay at the hotel because the hotel had charge me for staying there already. I informed the representative that was not an option and that I had been on the phone with him for about 40 minutes now. I also, told him that I will be arriving in Orangeburg, SC in about 1:00 and I need for this matter to be resolve. The representative put me back on hold to the point; where I had to use another phone to call back into Expedia. In speaking to the representative Alex from Expedia who assure me that he was a supervisor and that he will resolve my issue. I informed him that I was on hold with another representative from Expedia for a long length of time. Alex told me that I could hang-up from the other representative and that he will document that I was left on hold. 	In speaking with Alex he placed me on hold so that he could review the reservation. He saw that the reservation was made for the 28th of March and not the 29th. He then called over to the hotel to see if he can get me a room. After, returning back to the phone from speaking with a representative from the hotel. Alex said that the hotel had already charge me for the night and if I wanted to stay there.  I would have to pay for tonight. I told him how could Expedia charge me for something, when I never check in?  He then went on to say that the manager is not there at the moment, and once he speaks with her it will be up to her if she would return my money to me. 	I have just arrived to Orangeburg South Caroline and went straight to the hotel. I still have Alex on the phone with me. I was speaking to the supervisor that was on call that night. I told her that somehow my reservation was book on the 28th of March instead of the 29th and that we travel from New Jersey for a memorial service for my mother. I also informed her that I was on the phone with the Expedia representative Alex. I explained that Alex told me that the hotel had already charge me for my room. Unfortunately, the information that Alex gave me was incorrect. The hotel sent the money back to Expedia. The representative for the hotel called her manager and explained what was going on. The managers inform the representative from the hotel to accommodate us with a room for the night.  Now I had the hotel on board with accommodating us with a room. However, Alex on the other hand refused to assist us. The representative from the hotel had to tell him what to do, and even than he gave the representative from the hotel a hard time. I have spent 2 hours on the phone talking to Alex trying to get this matter resolve. He refused to provide me or the hotel representative with his ID number. He did not want to use the Expedia credit card to purchase my room.  Instead of helping me Alex upset me so bad that I ended up having an Asthma attack while on the phone with him.  My sister had to finish talking with him about our reservation. 	I am writing for several reasons. First, I want to thank Baymont Hotel Staff for accommodating us with a room.  Second, I urge you to better monitor your policy on reservation and how your customer service agent address your customer.  To think what could have happened to us had the hotel did not accommodate us with a room.  We would never have booked our hotel reservation if I thought your staff would not have any of the following skills ""LEAD"".1. Listen -- 2. Empathize--   3. Apologizes --- 4 .Delivered-- Sincerely YoursDissatisfied Customer        "	                1	1	Monday	expedia	positive

744	"            My name is Theresa. I booked my trip for 3 of us over the phone as a 40th birthday celebration. I asked to have my list of wants to be met. I was led to believe they were. I confirmed all of my list with them over the phone and felt I was well on my way to a fantastic girls trip in the Caribbean. I even called a few months after having booked the trip to confirm everything will be as such and I was told yes it would be. Once the 3 of us girls arrived to our destination, we learned that it wasn't even on the Caribbean side of the Dominican Republic as we indicated was important to us. We had a ground floor that looked out onto a parking lot NOT sandy beach as we also expressed was important to us. In fact, this resort didn't even have a beach front option and we had to pack a bag and walk a trail to the water instead of steping out from our ground floor beach front patio that we were told we would have!The 24 hour room service that we indicated was important had 3 cold sandwiches to choose from with nothing of interest but had to succumb to and choke down. Was just awful and how they passed as acceptable to offer customers is beyond my comprehension. And none of us are picky princess type people. We just had our hopes up and were left extremely disappointed from the moment we looked out into our ""parking lot"" view. It was dark when we arrived and we were extremely saddened to learn this was our view! The water was cold to shower in each day, all day long.The a/c unit looked like it hadnt been cleaned for years and would leave our room with an awful smell!The food in the resort was absolutely awful and the exact same thing to choose from everyday for the entire week. None of which was appealing or with taste to be satisfied with. The place did not have a swim up bar as we also indicated was important and in order to get a drink you had to wait for several minutes to a near half hour or longer because there was only 1 bartender that operated in slow motion. We dealt with what sounded like domestic abuse nearly every night above us and each time we called security, the hotel did nothing to offer any sort of safety resurgence and made like they didn't understand us when spoke to them. !!! This is just naming a few things. ... the list goes on! When we called Expedia to ask why we were lied to and charged premium prices for a place that hadn't met even one thing on our list of importances and also expressed our uneasily feeling about the fighting and yelling and slamming around above us as well as cigarettes being tossed from above and landing on our wicker patio chair, they said they would investigate and get back to me. They did not! In fact before they hung up on me when I called back after not hearing from them, I was told to go to another hotel if we don't like this one. We spoke with a guy named Stewart from Expedia who claimed to be a supervisor/manager on shift or something like that. He also said that Expedia might possibly reimburse but somehow we can't get anywhere with selfish money grabbing company. Absolutely unacceptable and reimbursement of some sort should have been offered from them and we got nothing! Expedia is all about getting the sale and taking home the commission. They care nothing of customer service in our experience or what your personal experience will be like after having chosen them as a trustworthy holiday provider. All 3 of us have been left disgusted and are hopeful that someone from Expedia will step up and do the right thing by rectifying this situation while redeeming themselves! We are not frequent travelers and absorbing the premium cost for a subpar resort is unfair and criminal of them. They did not provide what we asked for nor did they care about it!

745	            I booked a hotel through Expedia and that will be the last time I will ever do. I had to cancel my hotel reservations last minute and they charged my credit card $200 as a cancellation fee. They did not try to dispute it or even another form of reimbursement. I am a military service member and will make sure no other member has this same experience. DO NOT book with Expedia.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	neutral

747	"            There are no ""savings"" booking with EXPEDIA because there is no customer service.  Details:  We rented a car online with Expedia and paid for the travel insurance.   Upon arrival at the Thrifty office at the Cancun Airport, they advised us they do not recognize EXPEDIA!   Thus, we were double charged for insurance and now we are disputing with American Express.   There is no recourse with Expedia!  They will not respond to requests for assistance.   We all want to save money which means saving our valuable time so go directly with the rental company.   Stay away from Expedia.        "	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	neutral
748	            I called the customer services hotline in order to be sure of all surcharges to a hotel I wanted to book. Was told several times on the phone that everything would be ok and that I wouldn't have to pay anything else... a day later I get an email from the hotel stating otherwise. I have contacted expedia on several occasions wanting an investigation and an answer and 2 weeks on still nothing, even though I have been promised 48 hours max for a response. In the end had to cancel the booking and book through a competitor.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	positive

We will reach out to you as soon as we can.

Thanks. ^AZTHURS 18:58ExpediaExpediaBy this time, your eligibility to purchase travel insurance has expired. You may inquire from your credit card company if they offer travel insurance. Thank you. ^AZFRI 10:31WilliamIt had not expired when I first spoke to you. It turned out that the statement by Expedia that I could buy the insurance up to  24 hours after paying for the trip was incorrect and may well have been a false statement because as pointed out by the insurance company once the trip is paid for you cannot buy the insurance at no time thereafter. After inspecting the insurance companies terms and conditions that appears to be correct. I am in the position I am now in because of Expedia's advice which is contradictory to that of the insurance company.WilliamYes that is the trip as you well know because I sent you the itinerary number.I feel very let down by Expedia and probably will not use them again unless they are able to correct the situation. And no! my debit card provider does not offer such insurance cover.ExpediaExpediaHi William, I apologize for the misconception. The late purchase of flight insurance is not guaranteed because some of the flights are really not offering insurance after you booked the reservation. ^CVWilliamyes that may be so but Expedia at no time told me that in fact they sent me an email asking or inviting me to complete a purchase of the insurance within the 24 our limit. When there is no 24 hour time period according to the insurance company.ExpediaExpediaWe apologize for the inconvenience caused. It is a system generated email and it is always be subject for approval. ^CVWilliamI am sorry that you are unable to sort this matter out to my satisfaction.

Each time I filled in the form and gave all the required details then pressed send and it then went back to a blank form. So after trying three times without the required result still within the 24 hours I contacted your customer servicesWilliamWho tried to do it for me also within the 24 hours. He got the same result and told me to contact the insurance company who told me a different story to Expedias, so I looked at the insurance company's rules and they clearly state that the insurance cannot be purchased after the tickets are paid for. Which means that Expedias invitation was worthless and misleading.

756	            PLESE DON't BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!! If I can help save one person from experiencing this terrible situation, then all my time and effort will be worth it. I purchased my vacation package through Expedia for $642, flight + hotel. When it came to checking in, I was charged an additional $220 by Spirit airlines and an additional $340 by the hotel Treasure Island. When I purchased my vacation package, I did not expect to pay nearly the same amount, again. I had no idea that Expedia only shows a portion of your total vacation package cost. Had I known there would be an additional $560, on top of the $642 that I had already paid, I NEVER would have booked through Expedia. I feel this is a major incident of deceptive business practices and charges. When I called and tried to talk to customer service and have this resolved, I spent over an hour talking to person, after person, after person and eventually when they would let me be transferred to someone at their corporate office, coincidentally, the call hung up and no one ever called me back - even though I gave them a CALL BACK NUMBER!!! This is the worst company I've ever done business with. Please, do not use them. Had I done the research ahead of time, I would have stopped before I purchased. Save yourself the money and the hassle, buy from anyone else other than these deceptive scammers.        	                2	1	Sunday	expedia	positive

758	"            Expedia is a scam! It is not worth it! Customer service is not service at all. It is a headache if you have to change or cancel your flight for any reason. We have used them in the past but never experienced having to deal with customer service since each time before things went smoothly. Each time we called, we spoke with a different person. They could not understand or speak English well. Even things as simple as them writing my email address down had to be repeated over and over. We were put on hold for 2 hours at a time before they would come back on the line and tell us they're still trying to get ahold of the airline to check the refund policy to try to get our refund. Then we would be put on hold even longer.We spent 7 hours on the phone with them the first day and 2 hours the second day.They kept giving us the run around and constantly asked if we wanted to cancel our return flight when the flight to our destination was canceled due to severe weather. They told us they were able to refund us for the outgoing flight since it was canceled but not for the return flight because it was with a different airline and that it had not been canceled due to the weather. The only way we finally were able to speak to an American speaking person was when my husband told the ""supervisor"" he was done talking to her and needed to speak with someone that could talk to him about their refund policy after she told us that they do not have a refund policy and that they do not have the ""money"" to refund us. The corporate guy has assured us we will get all of our money from the package deal refunded to us in about 7 business day.

Have to check with hotel if I checked out on time and was due any refund. Rep says will probably take another 2 weeks to process refund. Shady business practice if you need to hold my money for a month before you refund it. Unacceptable and there isn't a thing you can due about it.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive

First time Expedia customer, I will be sticking with Priceline &amp; other agents if any as I have never had any issues in all my traveling years and I will not use Expedia ever again for these many factors. Saving money with Expedia did not happen, it costed our family money and a full nights sleep on the streets of Orlando without paying double. Expedia was still paid by above hotels at their customers expense and they didn't make it right. Horrible customer service and portal.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative
764	            This company is horrible and customer  service is beyond the word incompetence. I was lied to and ripped off. Wasted 6 hours of my Sunday afternoon, I was given the run around and lied to over and over. I was buying travel tickets for myself, my daughter and my mother. The itinerary required different return dates for my daughter yet they acted as if I was asking for the cure for cancer and a trip to Saturn all expenses paid. Last time I buy anything from this company, it doesn't matter if it costs more elsewhere, there's no price when it comes to peace of mind. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere!        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
765	"            Annandale Arms Hotel Moffat.My wife and I are residents in Moffat and have been regular customers of the Annandale Arms eating there approximately once per month.  Generally the food has been good and we have never had cause to complain until approx two weeks ago when we both ordered the special minted lamb pie.  This  was very poor quality, and the ""meat"" was gristley/rubbery/ fatty.  Normally the duty staff ask if the meal is ok shortly after serving.  However,  the place was virtually empty and no staff were present in the bar area and we were never asked how the food was.  Eventually our plates were cleared and we complained commenting that we have never had cause to complain before but this pie was not good.  When I went to pay the young member of staff presented the bill without any reduction.  After some discussion a reduced figure was agreed but we were advised that we should have complained before finishing the meal.  I agreed but given no member of staff was readily available we had little choice but to continue.  However,  the main issue was our recent return visit to the  Annandale on Thu 30 Mar to listen to the music.  Having taken a seat and in the process of ordering drinks we were advised forcibly in full view/earshot of a crowded bar that we no longer welcome and were asked to leave.  No senior member of staff or the manager was available for us to discuss the situation and suitably embarrassed we left.   I find such drastic action based on one genuine complaint to be totally unprofessional and something I have never encountered in the many years I have eaten out.  I have recommended the place to many,  but after this experience I can only advise stay well clear.  It is interesting that very few local people ever seem to eat here.  Now I know why.

766	            Wish I could give 0 stars...Our 5th anniversary was this Fall, and I am turning 30 this summer.  So my husband and I thought a trip during my Spring Break (I am a teacher) was in order.  I began researching in January.  I am one of those meticulous, type A people.  I like to have as much information as possible, know my options, and make an informed decision.  This was not my first rodeo at planning an international trip, either.  After much research on many sites and speaking with a travel agent, we decided on a trip on Expedia featured as one of their 24-hour “Unreal Deals.”  Casa de Campo in La Romana, Dominican Republic popped up at the top of our “all-inclusive” packages search.  As previously mentioned, I had already spoken with a travel agent, with our only major criteria being our budget, an all-inclusive package (hotel, flights, meals and drinks), Caribbean beach, and blue water.  We had been saving for this trip for months.  I mentioned our interest Casa de Campo to our and travel agent.  She looked at the Expedia posting and was working on getting a price match for us.  Since she knew our criteria, I can only assume she was working under the impression that the package was all-inclusive as well.  As the hours passed that day, I was worried about missing the “unreal deal”, so I went ahead and booked the trip though Expedia myself.  Shortly after, my travel agent told me that she would have been able to price match.  In the following weeks, I researched things to do in La Romana and the excursions offered nearby.  We settled on a monkey encounter, and were very excited about being able to see the countryside and interact with the animals.  So I went ahead and booked that as well.   Fast forward to our arrival at the hotel around 3:00pm on Sunday, March 26.  Imagine our surprise when Yajaira (at the concierge) informed us that we did not, in fact, have an all-inclusive package with meals and drinks. Ok, a speed bump, we thought.  Let’s just call Expedia and get this resolved.  So…so…so wrong.  Keep in mind as the phone calls unfold, it costs $0.20 per minute.  We were on hold for about 10 minutes, spoke to an associate and explained the issue, and were put on hold again.  About 30 minutes later we spoke to a supervisor and re-explained the issue.  Then hold again.  And so this went on for HOURS as we went from one representative to the next, moving up the chain of command until we spoke to a corporate manager a few hours later (Let’s call her Daisy).  By then, it was too late in the day for her to speak with the reservations department of the hotel.  She told us she would see to our issue personally the following day when she went to work.  She said her shift started at 12:00 (4:00pm our time), but she would go in a little early and get started on it.  Next, we had to cancel our excursion to offset the cost.  We were both so disappointed that we wouldn’t get to see the monkeys. This was booked through Expedia as well.  Imagine how thrilled I was to get back on the phone with them…ugh.  And getting through to whom we needed via Expedia for that was also difficult and included more transfers and holding time.   I had received a voucher with a timeline for the cancellation and phone numbers to call for assistance.  One phone number was supposed to be an Expedia number.  Turns out both numbers led to the same person, and he told me I had to call Expedia.  He proceeded to give a different phone number.  Surprise, surprise, it did not work.  So instead, I emailed the person I had booked it with directly.  Fortunately, Joel Ernesto with Blue Travel does his job well and got back to me quickly.  He was understanding of the issue and was flexible with us.  Another couple of hours and $120 in phone calls by the time we were done.  By then it was 8:00pm.  We were exhausted, downtrodden, and starving.  All we had done since arriving was sit on the phone, unpack in our room, and worry.  Our entire first half day wasted.  I was beside myself, feeling panicked and ever so agitated.  I felt sick at the thought of the time and effort I had put into planning this and the extra money we may need to spend. We were finally able to go to dinner around 9:00pm. We looked forward to hearing from Daisy the next day in hopes of getting the issue resolved.  In the meantime, we paid for our food and drinks out of pocket.    By 5:30 Monday evening we had not heard from Daisy so we called Expedia and tried to be transferred to her directly. But we had to work up the chain of command yet again.  Holding, being transferred, and repeating ourselves over and over again.  Again, we had paid out of pocket for food and had only eaten once that day.  By 7:30pm, we finally had her on the phone.  We were standing at the hotel concierge in case she wanted to speak with a Casa De Campo employee.  Jose E. took the call and away he went trying to resolve the problem.  When he returned, he explained what could be done on the hotel’s end and offered us a few options.  Daisy said they had “investigated” the site to see what we saw at the time of booking.  She said if we had scrolled down and clicked on this and that, here and there, we would have seen that the meals and drinks were supposedly a separate package and additional charge ($1,200 additional to be exact—oh, and that was at a discount).  However, I still do not believe that this was the case.  Remember when I said I am type A?  My husband says, “borderline OCD is more like it!”  If what “the investigators” say is true, then the site is extremely misleading.  Daisy said she was not authorized to give us that amount of money.  So I asked her if we could get creative and think outside the box to come up with a way to help offset the cost of getting meals and drinks included for the next 3 days.  Maybe a credit?  Charge just 2 meals with drinks per day to the room and be reimbursed?  Pay for our excursion so we could still go?  Reimburse part of the trip?  Nope!  Nada.  Nothing could be done, so she said.  What a load of bull.  She said that she wasn’t authorized to give us the money.  My husband asked if we could speak to someone who was authorized.  She said that we would just get the same response.  Are you kidding me?  Really?  Expedia can’t afford to reimburse us a few hundred dollars?  Un-be-liev-a-ble!  Somehow I think they could have made it happen.  Like we don’t know the customer service staff is trained to use tactics like making us hold forever on the phone, apologizing, and making sympathetic remarks so we will drop the issue? Cancelling the rest of the trip would have cost us more than staying there, so the trip insurance Expedia offers and that I purchased is a joke.  So that was that, we had to stay.  And if we wanted to eat, we just had to pay.  But I will say that despite all of that, the hotel and property is absolutely breathtakingly spectacular and the staff was very sympathetic to our issue.  Remember Yajaira from the concierge?  She sent us a bottle of wine after witnessing the first couple of hours of our phone call at check-in.  And remember Jose E. who took the call on Monday?  As we were in between speaking with and holding for the corporate manager on Monday, I noticed that he was typing and clicking away at the computer and did not leave our side.  Turns out, he found us a better room that was available and arranged for us to upgrade, compliments of the hotel.  He sent a staff member with us who waited for us while we pack our things and then took us to our new room. If it wasn’t for the kindness of those 2 lovely people and the accommodating nature of the entire staff, I’m not sure how the trip would have turned out.  So a huge thank you to all of them, but especially to Yajaira and Jose E.  We enthusiastically recommend this property to everyone!  In addition to the hotel rooms, there are villas and other room options.  And the food?  To die for.   So, to our fellow travelers--friends, family, acquaintances, and strangers alike, we warn you about using Expedia to book your trips.  We hope that no one, ever, has to experience what we did.  And if you do choose to use them, call before you book to clarify that you are purchasing exactly what you think you are.  I urge you to share our story with anyone you know who travels.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	positive
767	"            Only works as long as nothing goes wrong.We booked a hotel &amp; flight deal with expedia. When a blizzard hit our area, our flight was automatically rescheduled for the next day. We were told to call Expedia hotline in regards to changes to our hotel stay (we would be arriving a day later than originally planned) and spent almost an hour (!) on hold, twice, before giving up. We called the hotel directly and were told everything was fine, but when we showed up, the reservation was listed as a ""no show"", because Expedia failed to inform the hotel. You'd think these things happen automatically, when the flight is rescheduled on a ""flight &amp; hotel""-deal, but no. It was super annoying, because we couldn't handle things directly with the hotel, but had to contact Expedia instead... but no one was answering the phone at Expedia! When I finally (after another half an hour on hold)  reached someone, it took another hour to sort things out.End of story: We paid for an extra night we never spent at the hotel and had a 2 hour stressful check-in with lots of phone calls, just to make sure we'd get a room for the rates we had booked. Will never book with them again, communication is awful and hotline is no help at all.        "	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative
768	"            I began booking a business trip, had my itinerary filled, and finally finished five hours later.i completed my itinerary, went to check out, and kept getting the error message ""unable to complete booking at this time"". I finally called customer no-service and the agent was very nice but unable to complete booking. He gave me a great price including first class seats and asked me to call back in an hour.when I called back the first time, i was told the price was double what I was quoted earlier and told there was nothing on file. I asked repeatedly for a supervisor and the agent kept say a supervisor couldn't do anything. when I demanded a supervisor, she hung up on me. I was calm and polite at all times.I called back again and demanded a supervisor and got one. She was very nice, and gave us the quoted price, but no seat upgrade. The price quote was on file. The biggest problem was she refused to listen, and kept booking the wrong day, times and reversing the airports.My first call was a trip to India, and my next two were to the Phillipines. I finally took a crappy deal because I was done, and it wasn't going to get any better. The whole package ended up $500 higher than first quoted, my hotel was $20 per night higher than the rate originally quoted, and every call started out was ,""you must be looking at the wrong flights and hotel"". When they went into my account, they saw that I was correct, and then tried to tell me the flights weren't available"" five hours into it, the unavailable flights were booked. I'm going back to direct booking: I've almost always been able to meet or beat expedia, et al.        "	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative
769	            Don't use Expedia ever!! I booked a roundtrip flight with two stops both way with Expedia 3 months ago. Everything started about 2 months ago when, accidentally, I saw that somehow my flight was changed that way, that I would spend extra 20 hours in transit airport on my way there and one of my flight on my way back disappeared. More on that: I DID NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING FROM EXPEDIA ABOUT THOSE CHANGES!! So i called to Expedia and tell me that AirFrance changed my flight because of some internal AirFrance issues and they did not find any info about my disappeared flight at all. I spend about 5-6 hours on the phone with Expedia about my changed flight and at the end Expedia told me that they can change my flight, in order to not wait extra 20 hours, but i will need to pay extra $1000!!!!!! What a hell?? My whole roundtrip was chipper than change, caused by the Airline!!!! Why should I pay for it?? So i refused, and after one more day on the phone with Expedia they told me that they will cancel my flight and I will get my money back. After 7 weeks of waiting without any result, I called to Expedia again about cancellation and they told that my roundtrip is still in the system and cancellation process was not even started!!! SO Expedia just LIED TO ME SO I LEFT THEM ALONE!!! And after 4 hours more on the phone Expedia told me that I cannot get my money back, because AirFrance don't want to speak with them! SO EXPEDIA, apart of they are LIARS, IS USELESS, because they will just leave you alone with your issues!!!By the way, each time when you calling to Expedia they switching you between the agents every 10 minutes (about 7-8 times each call) and you have to explain everything from the beginning again and again!!!        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
770	            Some months ago, I used Expedia to purchase return tickets for a qantas flight for my elderly grandparents to visit me in Sydney. The transaction was fine, until my grandparents reached out to me to see if I could change their return flight to an earlier date, if possible. I decided to call the Expedia agents to see if this might be possible — I explained the situation to him, and asked if he could let me know how much I would be charged for this. He told me this would cost me $4000, which was far too expensive for me — I told him that I could not go ahead with this, as it was too much money. We said our goodbyes and I thought that would be the end of it.That same day, in the middle of the night, I receive a call from an unknown number. It was the Expedia agent that I had previously spoken to. He tells me — there has been a “system error.” My original tickets, which I had already paid for, were GONE. He tells me he can fix this problem for me — If i give him $1500. I was appalled and confused. I said no, I will not give him my card details to fix a problem that was not my fault. I ask for the manager, who quickly backtracks. The manager tells me that it will be ok, I will not have to give them any further money, and he will try to fix my problem for me. Later that night, I receive another call from the manager — it’s the middle of the night and he has called me to tell me that my problem isn’t fixed, but he will call me back the next day when he’s fixed it.At this point, I was incredibly distressed and confused. It was completely unacceptable that my tickets were lost via the fault of a “system error”, and I thought it was very unprofessional to be called in the middle of the night and asked for further money to fix it. Unfortunately, the problem got much  much worse.I never received the call back that I was promised. Both the agent and the manager who I spoke to never called me back. I was nervous and stressed, so the next day I decided to call by myself, to see if I could ask someone else to please tell me what was happening. It was the peak season, and I spent at least half an hour waiting for someone to pick up. The agent who picked up the phone was baffled and had no idea what had happened — he puts me on hold for about 15 minutes and when he comes back, he assures me he try to find out what has happened, promising to call me back the next day. I was starting to become frustrated with being on hold, so I say “ok, please call me back.” The next day, he doesn’t call back. This same thing happened daily for about five consecutive evenings. I would repeatedly call, each time having to explain my problem to a new agent. Eventually it became apparent that there was no “system error” — the original agent who I had spoken to had made a mistake, according to one of the new agents that I spoke to. Each time I called, the new agent would promise to try and fix my problem, promise to call me back, and then would never call me back. I was completely panicked, because I had paid thousands of dollars for flights, and it seemed that I wasn’t going to receive what I paid for. I even started to doubt whether I was dealing with the real Expedia, as it seemed I was being totally scammed out of my money. After days of calling every night, I finally spoke to someone who told me that my tickets were secured, but that they had been secured for the earlier date I had asked for. I was so happy and relieved, thinking that the first agent who made the mistake tried to fix it in my favour and had simply forgotten to call me back. My grandparents made the appropriate arrangements for travel on the amended dates that this agent specified. I was assured that everything was fine, and received my updated itineraries. Everything seemed to have worked out just fine.By chance, some time later, I logged on to the computer to check my bookings. Without anyone informing me, without any phone call or e-mail — my flights were changed back to the very first date I had paid for. If I hadn’t noticed this, my grandparents would have packed up and left on the wrong date. I decided to contact Qantas to ask why my booking had suddenly changed, who notify me that it is the doing of an Expedia agent. This meant that Qantas couldn’t try to fix my issue for me, and meant more phone calls for me with the Expedia team. More hours spent explaining over and over, to multiple people, what had happened. I was completely confused and frustrated, and totally alarmed at changes happening without any notification. Again, none of the expedia agents I spoke to could really explain why this was happening. I decided to vent my frustration in the form of a Facebook post to Expedia. I explained everything I had been through, all the time I had put in and all the mistakes that the agents had made. As a result, I later received a phone call from Expedia — a woman who explained that she had seen my complaint, and would like to fix my problem for me, under the condition that I remove my complaint. Eager to have this problem resolved, I agreed.This woman took a further payment from my credit card, and then refunded it back to me, as this was (for some reason) the process for securing my tickets. She instantly sent me the refund, the receipt, and my new itinerary — which was a huge relief. At this point, I was sure this problem must be over. A couple of days before my grandparents were flying, I decided to contact Qantas to organise wheelchair assistance for my grandmother who is wheelchair bound. At this point, I had received a number of new itineraries with all the correct information, so of course, I was under the impression that all was ok. When Qantas sent me a document confirming wheelchair assistance for my grandmother, however — my flight date had changed AGAIN. I was completely confused. I had received so many correct itineraries, and randomly just received one document with a different date? Thinking it must have been a simple mix-up, I contact Qantas to let them know that the document they sent me had the wrong date on it. The Qantas agent looks into this for me, absolutely certain that there was no mix up. He asks me to look at my ticket numbers — and I realize that these new tickets sent to me by the female expedia agent who had seen my Facebook post, had the exact same ticket number as my previous tickets. According to Qantas, the correct tickets were never issued by Expedia!Furious, I call Expedia AGAIN. I explain what has happened, letting the agent know that my itinerary was re-sent to me by Expedia agents, but that the correct tickets were never issued. He can see this, and asks me to wait while he calls Qantas for himself in order to fix the issue. From what I can gather, the female agent who found me through Facebook had attempted to fix my booking, but hadn’t fully completed the process of securing my tickets — days before the flight.Anyone reading this, I urge you — please, please do not book ANYTHING via Expedia. I have lost so many hours of my time because of their incompetence. I have literally lost sleep, stressing over this bizarre, drawn-out transaction. Every Expedia agent I spoke to was totally polite and kind, and assured me that everything was fixed, when it wasn't. Do NOT trust them and do not involve yourself in this nightmare of a company. It breaks my heart to think what would have happened if it had been my elderly, sick grandparents trying to fix this for themselves. Expedia were a complete nightmare to deal with, and I will never do it again.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
771	            I booked flights through Expedia for a family vacation.  Shortly after booking I noticed that they had double billed my account to the tune of $900.  After and hour and a half on line with various Expedia reps (where I was told different stories) they informed me that it was a hold on my account that would be refunded in five days.  Since they already had my original $900 I demanded that the second billing be refunded immediately to my account.  They were very rude and basically said it was out of their hands.  In the meantime there had been no mention of them holding double what the cost was and I had already written checks against the $900 that was suppose to still be in my account.  I will NEVER use Expedia again.        	                2	1	Friday	expedia	negative
772	            Cancellation insurance is a scam.  Expedia will only let you cancel if the airline cancels.  How ridiculous is that?  OR, if you have a medical excuse. Guess what?  You don't need insurance from expedia for your trip if either of these things happen.  Buy your ticket from the airline directly, and they will reimburse if you get sick or if they do something to screw up your flights.  I will NEVER use expedia again.  Never.

She was had completed the ROC process and had her green card.  But her passport was still in her maiden name.  So we booked her under that name.  Then in January we start the process on getting a new passport under her married name and it came in in early March.  I have been trying to update her ticket through both expedia and EVA air.  Last night after 3 hrs on the phone with Expedia, they tell us that beside the $50 fee, EVA want to charge us the difference between the original ticket price ($650) and current ticket price ($1275).  Unbelievable, and I asked to speak to the managers boss.  They transfer me to corporate who said it was our fault for the name issue and that EVA will no longer do a name change for us.  And we have to buy a brand new ticket.  So for her to fly to PI now it has cost us close to $2,000.  Make sure you book tickets under the name that will be on a passport at the time you fly everyone...............Bank account a lot lighter than should be.French Family        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	neutral
774	"            I travel A LOT. Over the last decade, my most frustrating moments have been with Expedia. If you are are booking through them, PRAY that you don't have to change your reservations. Expedia is extremely unhelpful, the wait times are loooonnnggg, you eventually speak to a ""supervisor"" who can not help you. Through my experience, book directly with the hotel or airline, they are far more helpful and willing to work with you. I recently had a Delta flight that I needed canceled. Delta said they would refund the flight but it had to be approved by Expedia. I bought insurance but unfortunately it is only valid if it is a medical emergency. Expedia would not refund the flight. The only two times this has happened to me in 10 years was when I used Expedia. Lesson officially learned.        "	                1	1	Friday	expedia	neutral
775	"            This is a long story - but in short....  I had an issue with wanting to cancel 1 nights stay for 1 of my rooms (which was part of a large group booking). The customer service I received was awful - i had to explain my situation to multiple members of staff. I then asked to speak to a supervisor who told me he would speak to the hotel and return my call the next night (Monday). I had to call this ""supervisor"" back on WEDNESDAY for him to tell me he called me yesterday (Tuesday) and left me a voicemail???? LIES. I had to take time out of my day to once again call expedia back. In total i have spent around 3-4 hours within 6 days on the phone trying to sort this issue out. And still Expedia could do nothing more to help me. I find it completely unprofessional that a ""supervisor"" and his staff could not return my call and update me on my situation and then clearly lie to me as a paying customer of their service. It was so easy for the supervisor just to pass it off and say he had called me when he clearly hadn't - and told me he was too busy with other things to call me back on Monday. Although he PROMISED HE WOULD AS HE WAS AWARE OF MY CIRCUMSTANCES. An update that he was busy would have been completely appreciated - instead of allowing me to feel i was forgotten about.

783	            I have used Expedia for years, and been relatively pleased with them, but they seem to have done away with customer service.  With an upcoming snowstorm - I emailed them several days in advance to find out what I could best do for ensuring my trip would survive the storm.  No response.  Ever.  Then my poor husband spent about 5 hours on their customer disservice line only to have them book us on the wrong flight and then when he called back they couldn't find the booking at all.  I am really disappointed in them.  I understand they can't control the weather and that there were a lot of unhappy people on the line, but this was unacceptable, and the price guarantee?  That's a myth - what you have to do to get it - will never happen.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

However we have spoken directly to BA and the hotel and once we send medical evidence they will consider or circumstances. However Expedia will not ring back, ignore our emails (we have tried on 4 different accounts) and have had me in tears at the rudeness of one ""customer service"" agent.And I am sure that Expedia will reply to this to say ""our complaint is being dealt Escalations"" and the outcome has been shared. Or that they understand that we not happy. And Expedia please don't say that you have investigated our claim thoroughly and provided an out come. You have not.

792	            This is about an ordeal we went through for booking a simple trip at one of the most celebrated and popular travel company - Expedia.It all started from a friend expressing their desire to celebrate something significant at a certain place. They invited 3 of us as couples and we all decided to celebrate something significant there. Once our vacation leaves were confirmed we started looking things online. We narrowed our choice down to a package offered at Expedia. Our ordeal began at 10.30 pm and lasted till 1.00 in the morning just to book a simple trip for 8 people.First we were told that we can book only 4 at a time hence two of us were calling Expedia simultaneously. Every time they would give us a final quote and we would take 2 mins to decide, as 8 of us were together at a place celebrating Women s day, the price would change. By the time we would confirm they would take another long pause to confirm  and quote another price. This happened a few times. Once everything went through and we confirmed on the spot and gave all the details, they got back saying that it's full. The place I am talking about have hundreds of rooms per hotel and in a minute they were all gone while it's showing available online. The struggle continues which eventually progressed to an anxiety provoking situation making 8 of us stay awake till 1.00 in the morning on a snowy Wednesday night with work next day.The thoughts in my mind were that Expedia is nothing about vacations at a click (which I wouldn't even expect) but rather challenging  and manipulative. I could have given all the details here but I am maintaining my dignity.It was shocking that two of us on different calls to the same company were getting different quotes and the price was different from the ones showing online on Expedia. Every 5 mins the price would change and go up significantly. Its like being reprimanded for taking 2 mins to decide (conversions, budgets, sharing or other such details all to be decided in few minutes when the person is saying atleat a few times that they cannot hold for that long) to cut the story short we got two different prices, 2 couples at a certain price and two at way more. At the end of it our happiness faded in microseconds as we had started from a certain budget and made final bookings at significantly high amount.The process was not at all customer friendly, it created panic, ripped us off the right to make a decision as it was about saying a yes on the spot otherwise the price may go up again. How can the prices change every 2 mins that too when the customer has already been talking, how can you go ahead confirm take the details and then say that the deals goes for one hotel of our choice and take time to ask us to select others. In minutes 8 people have to select other hotels, rethink their budget and other things. It is ridiculous that customers are ripped off like this, I find it unethical that you hike up the rates during long weekends. How much greed driven it sounds as anyways things are full as more people would travel on holidays instead of offering discounts ( the way it's made to look on the website) the ripping of psychological thriller starts and takes away every bit of sanity and decision making from the customer. The two couples are first timers and thank God they didn't have to go through this by themselves.Will we respect Expedia - NoWill be ever use them again - NoWorst is that 2 of our friends couldn't even join.I understand that it may not just be you , that the airline company is equal partner in crime, but as young couples we are very upset by the whole process. It can be simple and streamlined.- by 8 disappointed customers        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive

If you can find their phone number, after you wait on hold forever, you are connected to someone in another part of the world who barely speaks English.  Their ability to complete BASIC tasks, like re-booking a flight takes FOREVER, and then they screw it up.My wife and I had to make a change to one of our airline tickets purchased through Expedia.  My wife spend 2 1/2 HOURS on the phone (and this was with a ""supervisor""), just to have this simple change made.  I was listening in, and could not for the life of me understand what the Expedia employee was doing on the other end of the phone.  What could be taking so long???  In the end, Expedia assured my wife that everything was taken care of, and that she would be getting an email confirmation shortly.  My wife didn't want to hang up the phone until she got the email, but Expedia told her that it could take up to an hour for the email to come through.  So, she took that in good faith and hung up.A few days later, when no email ever arrived, my wife called the airline.  The airline told her that Expedia had CANCELLED her flight!!!  My wife was practically homicidal at this point.  She spent another hour on the phone with Expedia, and we still do not have this situation resolved.This company is a JOKE!

I waited a couple of weeks for all the paperwork to get through and never saw a refund for that night. I call up Expedia and they are more than happy to refund that night but the hotel wants to know a description on the employee or the name of the person behind the desk. I wish I knew we had to write down name and description of the person because I would have in a heart beat. The hotel know who was working that night but they won't deal with it.

I booked a transport van with Expedia for a company called Amigo Tours in Mexico City.

Upon arrival to the hotel we were given a rum with single queen bed, and even though their records indicated two beds they did not give me the requirement two beds room because they did not have it at the time , the hotel told me that it was mostly Expedian's fault because somewhere in the add within Expedia website indicated a BEST effort  on two beds , but I never saw that print or it actually does not exist..  to cat the story short , Expedia blamed the hotel  like both pointing fingers at each other.

I booked a double-tree hilton recently through hotels.com and was charged way over what hilton would have charged me had I booked directly through hilton. I knew about the price guarantee scheme hotels.com runs so I simply made a price match request believing it was going to be a straightforward process. Far from it. After providing them with as much proof as they asked for they still refused to price match coming with the most ridiculous and bizarre excuses to avoid having to adhere to their price guarantee promise. It wasn't the refusal to price match that bothered me the most but it was their dishonesty and complete lack of customer care that bothered me the most.

811	            I am very disgusted and dissatisfied with the service I received. Booking my vacation and receiving my confirmation was the easiest part. The day of travel i arrived at the airport at the recommended time 2 hours before departure only to find out the flight was overbooked and I wasn't allowed to board. Strike 1. The airport make arrangements for me to fly out the next day but now I'm one day short of my planned vacation. I contacted Expedia to make them aware of what was happening and I need my check in date to be change to the following day and I would still like to spend 5 days so can they also extend the check out date to one additional day later, and I will pay the difference if necessary that phone call to 3 hours in which I was assured everthing was taken care of. That they had spoke to the hotel management and I'm good to go. I arrive at the hotel the next day and upon check in my check out day has not been extended and the hotel stated they never had an conversation about extending the check out Strike 2. Hotel advised that I needed to contact the travel agent again to get this settled. I spent 3 whole days of my vacation on the phone with Expedia for hours at a time at international rates still get no resolve. They just kept bouncing me around in circles Strike 3. So now I'm up to the last contracted day of my reservation and this still hasn't been resolved and every time I call Expedia it's like I never called before like it's a brand new issue. They would lie and say they are trying to contact the hotel while I'm standing right at the desk. This situation was handled poorly and I will never use Expedia again. I was ultimately forced to check out and find elsewhere to stay at my own expense since nothing was resolved and it was check out time. I have been calling before my departure spending countless hours on the phone. This was the worse vacation ever having to spend the whole time on the phone trying to get a resolution that I was told was already handled.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	positive

When you're supposed to be on Norwegian cruise line through South America, but instead you're back home in Canada with your children all because Norwegian cares to educate the cruise ship centres about not bringing a Samsung 7 aboard instead of educating their sales centres about proper documentation required to sail through South America. After being told we cannot board because of insufficient documentation, They left us stranded for 7 hours without any assistance, nobody came to our aid, when we were told we couldn't board. They told us someone would help us with computer access or phones to find other means of hotel or accommodation until we resolved the issue. But they never came. No free wifi. We had to use our own. And now our phone bills will be hundreds of dollars. They avoided us until the entire centre cleared out. They didn't bring us water, they just said sit here and someone will come help you. My 6 and 8 year old sat on a chair and waited and waited to hear anything at all. Nobody cared to offer them a drink or maybe some food? No. Nothing. No one came to offer us any help. They told us to find our own way to Uruguay and that the Brazilian embassy could issue a visa to us in 24 hours which was a lie. We tried, we tried a water bus, a bus station, all sold out. We were told it's a week to get an appointment and 3-4 days to receive the Visa. They said anything they could go just get rid of us. We waited 7 hours for our luggage, but Norwegian sailed away with our luggage. We were left there with nowhere to go, no clothing, and Norwegian cruise line offered us not one word of consolation. The agency I booked our cruise though, Expedia cruise ship centres has told me that Norwegian has not educated them on this matter and they weren't made aware by Norwegian. So who is responsible for our trauma, our stress, our tears? Who will make this up to our children who had one outfit, one underwear, and had to return to canada a week too soon without their winter clothing? Who is accountable? Not to mention Expedia for Td sent me a confirmation email that our flights had been switched to a sooner date out of Argentina since we couldn't get to Brazil, however upon arrival at airport Expedia had failed to issue our tickets and couldn't let us board. So we had to, out of our own pocket pay $10,400 for a one way ticket home and we ran through the airport seconds before they closed the gate. Had we not had the available funds we would still be in Argentina, stranded. To this date, I still don't have our luggage. The nightmare Norwegian started, spiralled and continued causing more and more of a trauma for us, for days on end. Tell me Norwegian &amp; Expedia , who is responsible for this.Family and friends feel free to share. We need to create awareness. How are we to know if our agency tells us we don't require any other documentation except our passport? Norwegian told me the previous week 80 Canadian/American people were denied boarding, and our week around 30 Canadian/Americans. They must be proud. And yet week after week this happens with the Brazilian visa and they create ZERO awareness. And ZERO solutions from Norwegian. I sure am happy for our luggage however, sailing the world without us. I'm sure the luggage will have lots of amazing memories to tell our children, those of which we were robbed        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	positive

I didn't realize this until I received my credit card bill a couple of week later. I spent over 4 hours on the phone (mostly on hold.)

821	            We are not long back from the most horrific holiday experience one could imagine, worsened only by the lack of customer support afforded to us by Expedia UK. We notified them immediately upon checking into our room that we could not navigate 30+ steep stairs with NO hand rail. We were told it was our duty to investigate this beforehand. However, I've never encountered a 10+ stairway in a 4-star hotel, or indeed any public stairway, that didn't have a hand rail so didn't anticipate a problem. So are Expedia are implying we should check beforehand if our 4-star hotel has pillows, sheets and dustbins? We were EVENTUALLY moved to a more expensive room (the fee would not be waived) which was supposed to be an 'upgrade' but the conditions were revolting and more befitting of a 1-star than a 4-star hotel. Expedia were terribly unhelpful. Did nothing to help us and offered us a measly £100 in post holiday compensation. £100 is like a slap in the face considering we spent £2000 in total on truly disgraceful accommodation. I will NEVER use Expedia for accommodation again and will pass the word on like wildfire!        	                2	1	Monday	expedia	positive

824	"            On Tuesday, May 24, 2016, I bought 6 (six) round trip tickets from Rome, Italy to Atlanta, Ga. for my friends in Italy to visit over the Christmas and New Year holidays. My reservation was booked and confirmed for Dec 24, 2016 thru Jan 8, 2017. The itinerary # 1136158612357, confirmation MMX41A (Alitalia), with a Departure on Sat, 24 Dec on Alitalia 7600 operated by Delta Air Lines Inc. and Return on Sat 7 Jan, Alitalia 7601 operated by Delta Airlines Inc. I also purchased the Expedia Flight Protection Plan. In early October 2016 my friends were finally allowed to reserve their seats. Five of the seats were reserved without problems, however one name had a letter wrong and needed to be corrected. On Tuesday, October 11, 2016 I called Expedia customer service to correct the name. They told me to call Delta. I called Delta they told me to call Alitalia, Alitalia told me to call Expedia my ticket agent. I called Expedia on Oct 11, 2016 and talked to Mr Chung. I told him I needed to correct spelling of a name on the reservation. He assured me a correction was allowed. After about 50 minutes on the phone he told me to expect an email or phone call verifying the correction with 72 hours. Sounded good! On Friday, 14 October, 2016 after not hearing from anyone like promised, I called Expedia customer service again. My agent said her name was Lenona. After over 3 hrs on the phone back and forth with numerous people she finally told me they could not fix it today because Alitalia system is down. She told me she would call me back at 11:30 CST on Sunday, 16 Oct 2016. I stayed home from church to take the call. Of course like before it never happened. At 12:45 CST on Sunday Oct 2016 I called Expedia customer service again with and my wife on the phone. This time I got a customer service agent who said her name was Maya. After explaining the situation that I needed to make a correction to the name she told me you can't change the name. I had been assured all along that name corrections were allowed, but when I tried to explain it was a correction and not a change I was cut off at 1:15 CST. Of course we called back to the Expedia Customer Service and contacted someone who called themselves Troy who gave us a supervisor named David who again assured us they could make the name correction. He said he was turning it over to a team that works those kinds of issues. He said it was logged into the system to track the results of the call and they would respond within 72 hrs. Of course they never did. We did call back again and whoever I talked to told me we could not use the ticket and would have to buy another one. He told me I would be able to get a refund on my original ticket after we had not used it. He quoted me a price of over $5900.00 for a ticket we originally paid $789.66. One word ""ABSURD""! That's when we decided to call the Alitalia airline direct and was able to purchase another ticket for the child, so our friends could stop worrying about it. The ticket we purchased was significantly cheaper than the quoted Expedia price. I contacted their Corp. office through their BBB office.  Their Corp. answer was  they had offered me some options so they considered the matter closed.        "	                1	2	Friday	expedia	positive

Flights were changed to wrong airline, time, etc. We had to have everything timed accordingly to get his remains to the funeral home and also pick up another child at the Atlanta airport along the way to take him on the next leg of the trip with us. Hotel booked incorrectly with only 1 bed. Car rental left off car seats. Spent 3 hours, very distraught on the phone with customer service, who while trying to correct it made it worse. Charging my card $5000 and first telling me the card was not charged, then that it was, unable to cancel. Had to call the bank on the other line to increase my daily credit limit and they said that Expedia needed to stop what they were doing because they were sending multiple charges (8 of them!). Begged, in tears as this was too much for me given my emotional state. to get someone to help him fix this. After 2.5 hrs he finally got a supervisor to correct things. He had to process 2 separate refunds. Thought everything was fine, the last portion to be refunded was due yesterday, but did not get refunded. Emailed Expedia and they responded that they could not find any refund due. Called today and they can't find the trip. Finally found it and they say they can see the refund is due and are attempting to process it again. Going to yet another supervisor to try to process. So far another hour with them on the phone.

I got the flight from Jan 26th - 29th and the the site specifically said I would get a flight booked ""departing within the hours of 10pm-6am"" starting on the 26th (so I assumed it would be a redeye). Instead, Expedia booked me on a Delta flight at 5:36am on Jan 26th, which no, is not between 10:00pm and 6:00am starting on Jan 26th. I called Expedia AND Delta and they played the blame game, both parties blaming each other for the site's mess up. Neither one would help me, they just kept telling me over and over that they can't help. I offered multiple times to send them the screenshot that I took to show them that I had no idea that the flight would be before 10pm on Jan 26th, but they wouldn't listen at all. I am appalled at the lack of help and the amount of stress that I was put through. I have since bought an entirely new ticket through Southwest Airlines and have lost the $321 I paid to Expedia.

834	"            Expedia has got to be the worst travel agency.  I just cannot think of any place that has worse service.  The agents are all like robots who simply read off a script without ever listening to what you are asking or explaining.  They boil everything down to the most simple concept and give you an automated response without actually listening to the specifics of your case.  You can provide them as much background as possible and in the end, they just say, ""Basically"" and boil your point down to nothing.  For example, I booked a flight for a family member.  The flight had a layover.  Unbeknownst to us (because Expedia never made any mention of it), the airport for the layover closed at night so the passenger had to have a Visa for the country where the layover occurred.  Because he did not have a Visa for that country, he was not allowed on the flight at all.  When I expressed the issue to Expedia, they transferred to me several different people who gave me the same automated response. ""Sorry, no refunds.""  When I expressed the issue and that Expedia had never gave us a warning that he would need a Visa for the layover country, the Expedia representative condescendingly said to me, ""Well, I normally check the website for the Airline before I book.""  It did not occur to me that an international airport would close and he would need a Visa for that country.  Expedia needs to provide a warning for their customers instead of cheating them out of their money and then blaming that Airline for the ""no refund"" rule.  Interestingly enough, when I called the Airline, the Airline stated that it was Expedia that didn't provide the refund, not the Airline.  I called numerous times in the past month trying to get a response because I was told by one of the Expedia representatives that if we sent a notarized letter from the departing airline's representatives that there was a rejection of the Visa, that the Airline would grant a refund.  I didn't know who to send the letter to and when I called back and tried to explain the background of the situation and explain that while I know that refunds are generally not allowed, this is a different situation with an exception (in small print) and that all I need to know is to whom to send the letter to.  Without even listening to me, the agent said, ""Basically you want a refund.""  I said, yes basically, but it's only because of the rejection of the Visa-trying to make clear that this was not a typical situation and there was an exception for it.  The representative puts me on hold for at least 25 minutes and when she returns she says, ""Basically you want a refund and I investigated and you cannot get a refund because there is a no refund policy.""  At this point, I have had it with Expedia and I told the representative I was aware of the no refund rule (as I clearly expressed to her up front so as not to have her waste her time).  I even had asked her to speak to a supervisor because I knew that the agents at her level were not able to handle the negotiation of the refunds.  Instead she decided to waste both of our time by not listening to me and giving me the same automated response everyone else had given.  I don't even blame her because this seems to be the rule at Expedia given by top management as everyone gives the same automated response.  Finally I am transferred to someone who seemingly cares and tells me where to email the letter as she will purportedly negotiate the refund.  I get a response from her within 24 hours saying that the Airline rejected the refund.  There is no mention of who they negotiated with and no response to my email.  She had even told me that when they send the letter to the Airline, the Airline does its own investigation of the validity of the notary and the letter.  I highly doubt an investigation occurred in less than 24 hours.  This email seems to be another one of Expedia's automated, fake responses.  This is the worst service I have ever experienced with any business.  I am usually very tolerant of bad customer service but this is completely unacceptable.  If there were 0 stars to give, that's what I would have given this business.  I am never booking with Expedia again.  Do not waste your time.        "	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

Thought we had a really good deal - turned up at Gatwick for the trip to Reykjavik on Icelandair - checked in fine, really excellent flight and service. Had a great few days in Iceland (my husband booked our hotel independently ) and then went to the airport to come back British Airways. Found out at the desk that our ticket home had no baggage allowance! Ended up paying £138 for two bags! Don't blame BA at all but I consider Expedia are ambiguous and deceitful in their selling and it's only when you look into the very small print that you see that there may be additional charges for baggage. At no place on our invoice does it state that the return leg was a flight only with no baggage allowance. This is a really deceitful way to sell you flights and I cannot remember ever being deliberately sold a ticket without a baggage allowance for the return leg of a journey! It's made worse by the fact that we had the normal allowance going out so didn't even consider that it would be an issue on our return.Still, lesson learnt and we will not use Expedia ever again and won't  recommend that anyone else does either!        	                3	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

They passed me on to another agent who after keeping me on hold for an hour says that she is trying to understand what I need to change in my ticket. After keeping me on hold for another hour, she said that she tried to correct the mispelling but for some reason Jetblues website is not showing the updated name. She told me to go to the airport and figure it myself. I asked her if she can provide an email interaction of this so that I can contact JetBlue or show it at the airport as I would need some proof that Expedia tried to correct the issue. She wasn't willing to transfer the call to a supervisor, give me an email interaction or even mention her full name (only mentioned that it was Juliet T). She kept me on hold for two hours and was very rude. She said that I booked the ticket from Jetblue, and Expedia didn't take money from the ticket so it is Jetblue who will fix this.This was the worst customer experience. I would never book a ticket from Expedia. If Expedia is not willing to take responsibility, then it should shut down, It cannot ask a customer to figure it on their own when it is something they are supposed to fix as per the airline's policy. Is Expedia not making money from its customers. Why does Expedia consistently keeps its customers on hold for an hour, 2 hours and sometimes more than that. Has Expedia's management and CEO ever tried to Google 'issues with Expedia', 'how to escalate issue with Expedia'.

Their ""Corporate Escalation Manager"", James Wright, only served to escalate our complaint further by being disengaged and lying. This included telling us that he didn't have a boss. That, of course is not true. Once we found the contact information for his boss, we came to realise that the problem was systemic and not with James himself. One missed phone call led to this quote in an email - ""  We have made several attempts to reach you in regards to this matter via phone"". Several does not equal one.

We were standing around and we weren't sure when the shuttle was leaving so I decided to take my own car since I drove to the airport. The next day, I called the airline to receive a refund and they said no problem at all and provided me with a waiver code to give to Expedia since I booked through Expedia. Called Expedia only to be put on hold for 20 minutes at a time because they had to call the airline to get a waiver code. I explained to the rep that I HAD the waiver code but they just didn't seem to comprehend what I was saying. When I kept saying I had the waiver code or asked them questions, they danced around the questions and did everything possible to not answer me. Finally after an hour on the phone, they said they were still trying to contact the airline and would send me an email with an update. I said OK and hung up. 1 week later I received the email saying they were still trying to get in touch with the airline. I let it go for another 3 weeks and finally called Expedia again to get an update. When I called, a rep told me they didn't have any records of my previous call or the email! The rep transferred me to a ""supervisor"". I had to give the phone to my husband because I could not hold it together anymore without threatening them to take them to collections. Same thing. Asking her questions, and she would dance around the questions and never provide an answer. She then tried to ""contact the airline"" for a waiver code. While my husband was on hold I called the airline myself because Expedia kept saying they couldn't get in touch with the airline. They answered my call right away, didn't even have to press any buttons to get to a rep. The airline rep said that there should be no reason why they are having a hard time getting in touch with them because there was only a short wait time. FINALLY, the Expedia rep came back on the phone and said she would issue the refund. Received an email about the refund so hopefully they follow through.

845	            I have booked many flights and hotels with Expedia in the past. Flights mainly because of the 24 hour free cancellation policy. Today I spent over 2 hours on the phone with 3 different agents. First agent had to call the airline to check with them. She did let me wait for 35  minutes without giving me any updates.Entire call lasted 58 min. Call dropped. Agent gone. No call back. Second agent&gt; Same after 35 min, Third agent&gt; Told me the previours agents did not make any CSR remarks in their system. So no track of the bad customer service. Or is it fraud on purpose? My flight has departed by now... and still no solution after calling Expedia for 2 hours and 30 minutes!Bad service, empty promises and fraudulent advertisement!        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

848	            Do read the small print if you buy Expedia Travel insurance. I thought we would be covered for delay due to a missed flight as on a three stage journey we failed to make a flight  connection and were stranded for 26 hours, having to stay overnight and a day , waiting for the next available one.  This policy only covers missed flights at the START of a journey, not connecting flights. Very disappointing and ineffective. Also read the small print as this does not cover existing medical conditions. Not happy - paid £90 for nothing!        	                3	2	Friday	expedia	negative
849	            I had an absolutely awful experience with Expedia where they essentially scammed $180 of my money and provided absolutely no services.  They verbally promised to repay, twice.  And then they emailed that they would not, and several weeks later have simply stopped replying to emails.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.  Awful customer services.   Here are my issues with what occurred:-          I rented a car through Expedia and Europecar-          Prior to arriving to collect the rental car, I called Europecar to confirm the car category 'VW Golf or similar' who said that there were no VW Golfs in this range ever available in this category, and in order to obtain a golf or similar I would have to pay an extra £15 a day.  To advertise a car category in which the car does not exist is misleading advertising at best on the part of Expedia.-          When I arrived in person to collect my rental car I was informed that 'at the manager's discretion, I was to be charged an extra £1000 deposit as I was a British citizen residing in the USA'.  This was not detailed within the terms of the rental, and has never happened to me before when I have used Expedia for previous car hires with Avis.  As this was a refundable deposit, I continued with the rental, accepting this ridiculous charge.-          I was then informed that despite having full auto rental insurance coverage through my credit card I would not be able to rent the car unless I took out Europecar's own insurance at an additional cost of £25 per day.  Again, this was not detailed anywhere in the rental agreement, and has never happened in prior rentals through Expedia before.  At this point I suspected that the sales representative was attempting to overcharge for services.-          The total amended bill was then produced, at a shocking £200 extra, plus a £1000 deposit.  Given that I paid $178 for the car, this made absolutely no sense.  I then said that I was going to cancel the booking and the Europecar representative agreed that this was the best course of action, and added notes to the file to detail why my status as a British citizen living in America disqualified me from being able to rent from them as I still carried a UK driver's license but US credit card.-          The Europecar representative then stopped me when I was about to leave, and said 'let me see if I can cut you a deal outside of Expedia, oh look it's £278 for the car rental, will we do this instead?'.  This is unprofessional at best, and I can only assume that this entire farce listed above occurred as they are on commission and would rather personally make a sale than have one made through Expedia. This entire situation made me incredibly uncomfortable, given that the sales team had clearly attempted to manipulate charges in order to gain commission themselves.-          With the affirmation of Europecar's representative that everything must be cancelled through Expedia, and all was ok on the end of Europecar I left without a car.-          I returned home 30 minutes later, and called Expedia's customer team.  The woman I talked to spent 45 minutes on the phone to me, and contacted Europecar twice.  On this phone call she confirmed that the refund had been fully processed and would be in my bank account within 5 days.  She was profusely apologetic for the experience which I had just endured.-          I then received an email from Expedia 3 days later.  This was completely unexpected given that the customer representative said that the case was closed, the refund was being processed and would be transferred within 5 days.  I am utterly shocked at Expedia's complete lack of professionalism as this should never occur.  A full two weeks after this first email this sham is still ongoing, with Expedia now refusing to refund on the grounds that Europecar will not refund the monies which they agreed to do when on the phone to Expedia's customer services representative.  I should not be party to any of these issues as Expedia agreed to refund me fully.  If a vendor then backs out of this it should be on Expedia to reclaim, not me.This has been a horrifically bad experience and I will never ever use either of these companies again.  I strongly recommend that others follow suit.Update: itin # 7228952935771Update: it's now more than a month since this awful experience and no one from Expedia has responded or contacted me after asking for the itinerary number. I think this very well sums up my Expedia experience. Do not use this company.        	                5	1	Friday	expedia	negative
850	"            Never book a hotel with Expedia. They mimic your hotels website and you assume you are booking with the hotel, in my case, the Red Roof Inn. Expedia or reservations.com adds a 14.99 fee that is NOT listed until you book. It is not possible yo see this added charge unless you call for an explanation. When I finally spoke to a rude ""customer service"" agent, she put me on hold for 40 minutes explaining she needed to talk to her supervisor. Finally she said they would remove the added fee and agreed it is unclear in the booking process. OK, at least, they listen and respond I thought. The next morning Expedia (reservation.com) sent an email from""Maria"" stating they wold NOT remove the fee as promised and then the next day, I received an email from ""Ian"" repeating the exact same email. It's not so much the money that upsets customers like me it is the fraudulent practice and the lack of consistency in their communication. Beware . Book directly with your hotel, and call the hotel's front desk. When I spoke to Red Roof's customer service they encouraged me to pursue this and agreed Expedia or reservationd.com is not a business to use. I never will again.And neither will anyone in my family.        "	                1	1	Friday	expedia	neutral
851	"            We booked several tours through Expedia for our recent trip to Iceland. Once we were there, bad weather forced the tour companies to cancel the tours; they promised us refunds, and told us to call Expedia when we got home.  For over a week, I have talked to Expedia every day, and 24 hours later, I get a note from them saying we can't have the refund, because the tour company says our reason isn't good enough.  But while we were there, they promised a full refund!Expedia is wimpy!  They just send a note saying ""Well, Gray Line said no ...."" and that's it!  That's not an advocate!  That's a middle man!  That's just someone carrying messages back and forth between people!We are owed the refunds, and I will have to contact the companies in Iceland myself to get them, I guess. I have always booked things for myself, and dealt with the local company myself, and have never had this much trouble.  So in the future, I will rely on my self, so I can retain control of it.

852	            Super Shuttle in Cancun pvt car was a no show for return trip to the airport so I took a cab in desperation after 25 min of waiting. $30 charge. Emailed Super Shuttle and the hotel called but still no car. Expedia claims they have no responsibility for a no service problem from their vendors. Not sure which was worse; no show car or all that time with calls/emails to Expedia only to hear they are not responsible. Wasn't the money, just hate to pay for no service. Moral is book the car directly next time. One call to CC company and the charge would have been reversed.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
853	            I had to change a flight with expedia. Cancelling the original flight was easy. To book the new one I first searched for the exact flight I wanted and then called expedia customer service. After 11.5 hrs on the phone (on 3 different days) they still have not been able to re-book the flight!!!Each time I called the took 3 hours to find the flight on the system!!! I'm not making this up. This is my 3rd attempt, my call time reads 1hr 34 minutes, and I'm still waiting for them ti find the first leg of the flight (Direct flight Hamburg to Dubai with Emirates)Twice I was close to book but the price they provided me made no sense. 1st they gave me a price U$D600 above market value. A few hours later they managed again to find the flights but where now U$D 1500 above market value. I went to emirates and the flights value had not change. It was 1500 below what they were quoting me!!!!  I can only conclude the customer service is intentionally bad to prevent me from using my U$D1350 credit...

855	            Expedia.com applies currency exchange to the currency of the payment card without notifying customers. If your card currency is not US$, check your bank details, you will see that Expedia has make the conversion in its favor with an unknown exchange rate much higher than you bank would have applied. If you complain to Expedia, they deny that they are making the currency conversion and blame the international system. In their conditions they say that they make the transaction in US$ but it is not the case. They think their customers are too stupid to understand what they are doing and why they are doing it. They want to make money taking the control of the exchange rate instead of the bank, without informing their customers.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

857	"            My name is Alana I'm a 28 year old Female ill  try to make a long story short myself and my fiancé booked are trip to the Poconos Palace  for the first time through Expedia myself and my fiancé both was talking to the repersenitive we let the repersenitive know what we was looking for at the Poconos Palace we wanted the champagne room and we wanted it to be All-inclusive we did not want to pay for anything out of pocket unless we had to after all we are going on Vacation away from New' York  city  we arrived at the Poconos Palace on 12\26\2016 and we left on 12\28\2016 when we got to Poconos Palace we went to the front desk spoke to a repersenitive at the front desk my self and my hunny bunny  was excited we was told if we smoke to not smoke in the rooms or we will be charged $250 and we said okay they gave us are room key and they gave us a really confusing map to read to help us find are room but non the less after asking a few people were can we locate are room we eventually found are room are room was by the beautiful  lake The moment we opened are room door and went inside to check out what we had asked for with the Expedia repersenitive  everything we asked for was all a Big Fat Lie  #1 I walked into are room and was like ""What in the world"" in the words of my daughter lol and that was not a good thing #2 the room stink like a wet Dog the room smelt old lol#3 me and my hunny bunny wanted the champagne room that we asked for and received a completely different room we was so upset that I went to speak to the repersenitive at the front desk and told her how upset I am that I did not receive what I paid for which was not cheap if you ask me $700 and come to find out nothing was all-inclusive as was stated we had to pay for Breakfast and dinner which was not a reasonable price I was so upset all the lady said to use was that she was sorry and next time we should not go through Expedia  if that is so then why say to me that a lot of people has been having the same situation such as myself if that's so then why do they keep on letting this happen I smell a scam if you ask me because the  repersenitive at Expedia  are charging  you for the best room price  and give you low budget rooms  we was so upset of course my hunny bunny wanted to make the best out of it and let this be a lesson learn because we could not get are money back so what's the point of wasting are hard earn money that being said  myself and  hunny bunny had no choice to make it work until we turn on the heart shaped hot tube as we was sitting in the tub I notice that the tub was leaking water to the point it was all over the floor so I called the front desk to let them know that the tub was leaking they did bring someone out fast to fix the problem so the fixer told us that it was an easy fix and when someone tells me how easy something is to fix I don't believe them because if it was so easy to fix someone should have notice this problem before we came but of course its all about the money so he fixed it we left out for the night to try to get are mind off the negative so far on are trip also to be fair they did ask if we want to change rooms to the same exact room and I told them no because it was not going to be are champagne room form the jump and I was so ready to leave I felt hopeless and I never felt this way before I felt lied to from the Expedia repersenitive and the conditions of are room the smell and the only good thing in are room was the hot tub so I thought  which was leaking really badthe next day in the AM my hunny bunny wanted me to relax in the Hot Tub with him so I did but once again the hot tub was leaking water way more then the first time I did not even bother to call the front desk   I just did not care I was fed up I had it  so we did not use the hot tube and used the towels to clean up the water  also the housekeeping takes so long to clean are room they need more workers to do there jobs in the AM and not the afternoonI remember only one worker maybe two works saying hi to us while we was walking around the resort the Pocono's palace did not feel invitaing especially since this was are first time here and we drove from New' York we was tired and ready to relax not fix problems I do have pictures of the leaking hot tub I don't know how to upload the picture herealso to be fair  I did call Expedia and asked to speak to the supervisor and I explained what happen with one of there workers and what is happening at the resort and she did apologize and said that she will send me $100 certificate which was nice of her because I could of got nothing but at the end of the  day I still felt like that was smack in are face if I told her about my bad Experience what makes her think I want to come back to try out my bad experience again your first experience is your last experience Poconos Palace and  Expedia   should take this advice its sad that I called the  Poconos  Best Western hotel to see if the had rooms available I was welling to throw $700 plus away to go to the best western I been to that hotel 4 times and each time they had me coming back with my sister and nephew with my fiancé parents and his little sisters and are daughter for there graduation  and the reason this hotel has me coming back #1 the price and discount if you been there before#2 it feels like home away from home #3 free and great breakfast #4 every worker you come across always seem happy with a smile on there face even if they are not and they all say hi how is your stay and strike up a conversation#5 what you pay    for is what you get that's how you keep people coming by following these steps I know I wrote a lot I'm tired lol I hope this can help for the company or an

I was then told that it was a web problem and that I should rent the car directly with Dollars and that Expedia would refund me if the rent was more expensive. I even got a mail from them to confirm this. I then got a quote from Dollars, which was more expensive, and mailed Expedia how they would refund me the money. No answer. Then I phoned them, and after much discussion they said that they had a problem with their web site which changed the return place, and they had made a mistake about offering to refund me what if would cost to rent the car directly with Dollars - and that I should just rent my car elsewhere. No help. No refund. No nothing. Just go elsewhere. And no recognition of the mail they had sent me. I asked to talk to a supervisor and was told that he/she would call me back. I haven't heard from Expedia since then. Just an email asking for a review of my interaction with them. !!! What do you think! I will never ever use Expedia again.

It recommends to use Expedia for airlines as they hide the policy only they mention full policy if we facing issues I told them I have obiit 5 m followers from different country's and I will advice them to buy from airline direct they but 50$ lower than airline but if once you face any issue you will lose hundred as I found as websides more cheaper than Expedia        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

864	            I saw flights I wanted at a good price of about £620 per ticket. I went through the Expedia booking process, checking all my details were correct before submitting. When I got to the confirmation page, I had been charged £1340 or £670 per ticket. I had no warning that the price had changed during my booking, and promptly phoned Expedia. When I re-ran the search on Expedia, the original price was still showing. I would've been happy to keep the tickets if they refunded the difference in fare ie about £100. But I was told I had to cancel in the next 20mins, and then rebook. Then the woman who I spoke to said the flights had gone up to £4000 for two and maybe I should not cancel and agree to pay £670 per ticket. This sounded like a big con to me, so I cancelled.  One hour later, the flights reappeared, so I contacted Expedia by phone and paid £618x2 as I originally wanted.Two days later, I had been charged £618 x2 for the tickets I wanted, and also £665 x2 for the flights I had cancelled. Expedia assured my these would be refunded. However, my account was overdrawn even though I had funds to cover these payments, and when I contacted my bank they said that Expedia had placed a further £1290 on hold! This figure was bizarrely one of the cheaper fares and one of the expensive fares ie £618+£670. My bank said the transaction would not go through as they had no authorisation code, but nevertheless I was £900 overdrawn, ruining Xmas!Expedia assured me the £665x2 would be refunded within 5 working days.  However, one week later, it hadn't been.  When I called them, they said that it transpired that the refund hadn't been processed before their midnight deadline.  Consequently, they would have to re-listen to the recorded conversation to confirm that I had been promised a refund, before they would process it!  The following day one of their representatives called to say that they had contacted Lufthansa to request the refund, but Lufthansa were only wiling to repay the taxes of £205.  Expedia said they would refund the rest inside 7 calendar days, but the amount from Lufthansa may take 12 weeks to be refunded.  Two days later, Expedia had refunded their share, and offered a £50 credit to spend with them – they agreed to increase it to £75 but the voucher is only valid for a year and has to be used with them, which I am unlikely to do following my experience this time.  It may be March before Lufthansa return the rest of my money, which is clearly ridiculous.That was my experience of booking with Expedia.  I travel fairly regularly and have had no such problems booking direct with airlines.  I tried Expedia as they offered the best price for the open-jaw, multiple-airline itinerary I wanted, but the experience was quite dreadful as you can see.        	                3	2	Monday	expedia	positive

This was not a problem for Alamo, who returned the money from the rest of the days that I did not use the car. They also told me (I spoke with 4 different representatives from Alamo) that getting my money back from Expedia should be no problem (Gosh are they wrong!). Expedia won't return the money and they are blaming Alamo, telling me they won't let them, even though Alamo told me several times the other thing. To make matters worse, Expedia promised to contact me within 24 hour again, after a supervisor of the supervisors had looked into the matters - now more than 36 hours later still no contact!

Same thing happened only this time I was on hold much longer. At midnight the Expedia associate came back on the line and said that he was having trouble getting through to the airline. I didn't need to wait on hold anymore, and they would email me the confirmation, or let me know if we had to try another flight. No email came. 2 days later I called back.

I spend literally all day for 2 days on hold with Expedia. United was willing to change everything and they suggested I talk to a higher up at Expedia to cancel the reservation. I spoke to James who was absolutely NO help. I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH EXPEDIA AGAIN and I will tell all my travel buddies about my experience! Folks: GO SOMEPLACE ELSE!!!

871	            I just tried to book an airline flight through Expedia, but the price increased by $75 at checkout. I found this interesting since another subsequent flight search turned up the initial lower price. I called and spoke to a representative who proceeded to tell me that the airlines change their prices often and that must have been what happened. I asked him why I was able to search again and the original lower price came up on my screen. His first response was that it was a lower price if I would be booking a hotel room as well. I told him I didn't do that kind of search. I was only searching airfare. He switched back to his argument that the rates had suddenly jumped, but he quoted me $100 more than the original price. I told him that my computer screen was showing me a much lower price. He said he couldn't give me that price. I told him I didn't trust Expedia if the price they were advertising wasn't the price they were charging and that I would shop around. I booked directly with Delta and guess what? I paid $5 more than the lowest advertised Expedia price, which actually saved me money because Expedia's advertised price did not include taxes or fees. I'm flying my son out for his grandmother's funeral. We didn't need this added stress. I will never do business with Expedia. My business will be placed with companies I can trust.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

874	            I have been an Expedia customer for many years, but no longer.  I had booked a trip to go and visit my mother who had a number of debilitating health issues.  Because of her poor health, I wasted my money on trip insurance.  Silly me, I thought that because their website says that the key feature of their trip insurance is that you can cancel or change one time prior to departure.  I also made the mistake of thinking that since I wasted the money on trip insurance that I purchased through Expedia that they would handle any change with my itinerary.  But NO!  My mother passed away.  I called to cancel the trip.  Had a great deal of difficulty understanding the person I was speaking with.  She read off a script.  Cancelled the hotel and rental car and said she was going to charge me an additional $200 to cancel my flight.  I asked why if I purchased the trip insurance was I not being refunded.  The script says this is the way we do it.  Said I could call Delta and the insurance company.  Asked to speak with a manager, same thing, asked to speak with her manager, had to wait another 20 minutes, same answers.  I did call Delta.  The people there were not too much better.  I have to mail or fax in a copy of my mom's death certificate and a letter essentially begging for my money back.  My calendar says it is 2016, but Delta does not provide an option to email the request and therefore, I have no way to know when someone might open the mail and consider my request.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative

880	"            I recently booked an Alaskan Airline package and have bought numerous packages in the past and always been satisfied. NEVER AGAIN!  Alaska Airlines recently outsourced their packages and they are now sold through Expedia.  After the recent death of my mother, my daughter and I decided to take a quick trip to get away from it all. I am not a fan of Las Vegas however the price was right, she's never been so we decided to go ahead and book a 3 day trip.  Upon reviewing the reservations several days later, I noticed my last name was incorrect on the flight. Credit card is in my name, AK mileage account in my name- everything was correct except for the ticket. I have NO IDEA how it happened. I first called Ak Air as I thought the package was through them, they directed me to Expedia saying that Expedia could put in a waiver claim to change my name. Expedia refused. Refused to EVEN TRY to put in a waiver claim. Just a flat ""no"".  I had 2 choices. Lose $550, just walk away from the package OR pay a $200 fee to cancel the package and buy a new package which conveniently has went up $150. I spent 3 wasted hours on the phone with the supervisor at Expedia who again, REFUSED to even try and take care of this for me. I even ask for a reduced penalty and again absolute refusal.

When I brought the car back completely undamaged and with a full tank, Payless charged me $584. Over $200 than what I expected to pay. When I questioned the cost, Payless basically told me they charged me a liability waiver charge of $155 that I never agreed to and that was not included in the original fees amount given to me. I was also charged $70 in tax. Basically this rental was a complete rip off. Expedia is clearly not reliable when they're working with companies that falsely advertise a lower price to bring in business only to overcharge their customers later.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

There were 2 options, one of them is accepting 8 hours, one of them changing flight. I had to change my flight from Lufthansa to Air Canada. Nobody told me that I need transit visa to fly. I learned it by myself and gone to consulate. Now it is 16 business days left to my flight and at least 19 business days I need the consulate officer told me. So I tried to change my flight but expedia said, this is your problem and you have to pay penalty to change. Even they dont let me to change to my previous flight. Amazing customer service !!! Never never again with expedia. I had to pay 160 usd for the change which was completely expedia's fault. (Sergin Urfalilar)        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

892	            Where do I start?Please, please, please thoroughly check all emails from this company to ensure your booking is correct. Be warned there will be many emails most of which will be attempting to sell you something.In September I booked two flights to Venice. On making the booking I received a confirmation email. All good so far. On paying for the flight I was advised by Expedia i was eligible for a discount if I booked certain hotels in Venice. I clicked through and found my preferred hotel was on offer at a discount to other websites. What could go wrong? I clicked through reaching the payment page. I attempted payment the first time but the payment did not go through. I made a second attempt (the price had increased slightly but was still reasonable) and was advised the accommodation had been reserved and to pay on arrival. I was surprised but the Expedia website must be right so logged out in the belief all was well.Come the night before we travelled and checked the numerous emails to find the flights confirmed but no mention of the accommodation! A two hour phone call later did not resolve the issue even though the Expedia representative, Jeff Jonathan, confirmed I had indeed attempted to book the hotel twice the same evening I had booked the flights. Jeff Jonathan took control of the situation and explained the issue would be reviewed and to resolve the issue new accommodation was to be booked there and then. Thew..... things are in hand. He advised the original hotel was unavailable and for my original budget began to offer me inferior hotels. Unfortunately for Jeff Jonathan I was on the Expedia website which was showing 5 rooms were available at my preferred hotel. Perhaps he was not completely up to speed with the Expedia website!? He rechecked and indeed was able to offer me the room I had originally booked but at an increased price difference of around £250.00. This is where things became sticky and some 5 weeks later remain sticky and unresolved. The end result was that I had to pay the full amount with the promise of a full review of the situation and contact within 24 hours. Sadly no review or call back in 24 hours. On my return from Venice I have made several calls and am now emailing customer services, specifically R Prabhu. Initially R Prabhu reviewed my hotel booking that was made under duress the night before I flew to Venice and was advised there was no issue and the price paid was the price quoted. I explained by email that they had reviewed the wrong booking and to please read the email which explained the nature of the complaint. Some two weeks later no response so chased up R Prabhu. I received a prompt response explaining an email had been sent on 01/11/16 and a thorough review had taken place. (I have since checked and no email was received) The review found I had attempted a package booking with a 'lower cost hotel' and an agent had advised there was no availability hence Expedia were not responsible. No name of the 'lower cost hotel' was given. I twice emailed requesting the details of the 'lower cost hotel' but to date R Prabhu has not been able to advise me of this particular hotel. I have only booked one hotel with Expedia so am not impressed with the result of the review or the length of time the review has taken. I am coming to the conclusion that Expedia staff are trained or at least prompted to stone wall customers when errors occur and to provide a reason why Expedia are not accountable. If the customer is persistent Expedia appear to drag the process out in the hope the customer will give up. Very disappointing. You only know how good a company is when something goes wrong. How that company deals with the problem is the true test. With Expedia they have been tested and found to be wanting in many areas and I will not be giving any more business to them based on the way my complaint has been dealt with.Expedia, if you are interested my complaint ref. no. is S-131032001.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

Should you find a lower price for the same trip at another website, we will refund the price difference and in addition, we will give you a fifty dollar ($50.00US) coupon good on a future booking of an Expedia Special Rate hotel or air plus hotel package on Expedia.com. Please visit the following link to learn about Expedia Best Price Guarantee. You: so then why would I buy from Expedia if a different provider is already giving me a lower price? Ashish Kumar: That is just policy, which I need to inform you. You: so u still didn't answer my question Ashish Kumar: I did. You: why would somebody buy from you if someone else is already giving a lower price Ashish Kumar: Well, if you are not willing to buy from us. Ashish Kumar: That is totally your decision. You: and you still didn't answer my question Ashish Kumar: Price which you can see right now at your system are the best available and discounted price. You: its best available on expedia.com.. I did find a cheaper price for exactly same resort, same flight Ashish Kumar: Sorry for that, but I think I have answered the question. Ashish Kumar: That is why I have told you about Price match guarantee. You: now u are just answering around the question Ashish Kumar: Okay. You: but why go through the hastle to match when someone else already gives me a lower price and they are giving it to me from the start... You: so what would be my incentive to go through expedia? Ashish Kumar: If you are getting deal cheaper than expedia I would suggest you to buy from there. You: wow u are a great sales person... ill make sure to put exactly that when I will be writing a review for expedia After being quiet for some time and Ashish typing some nonsense.. this sales rep just pulls up my itinerary w/o my permission... is that even legal? and then he tells me to cool down and that I am not ready to buy a vacation.  This is the worst customer service I have ever received. Expedia just lost a customer and I would suggest for them to get customer service reps that actually care, since clearly this guy didn't.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive
910	            Don't book anything via Expedia. They charge your credit cards as soon as reservations are made. If they made error, you will be given a run a round even when they give you confirmation a full refund is due and you will have it with in 7 business days charged back to card. Even if they double bill you. They also blame hotels for their error. After this crap, please do as i do and use their site to find hotels, plane tickets and the like, then call for your reservations personally, you get the same price as you would thru Expedia or any of their subsidiaries such as trivage, orbitz, hotwire or hotels.com. They actually don't save you any money by booking thru them.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

912	            I booked a hotel for Jackson Wy,  or at least I thought so.  It was really a hotel In Dobios Wy over a hundred miles away.  I did not discover the error until I reached Jackson. I contacted Expedia ( after a 20 minute wait)They said they would contact the hotel (Branding Iron) and would clear up the error.  They asked me to remain on the phone while they did so.  I waited for 45 minutes and the phone went blank.  I assumed they would take care of the issue as they said they.  I noticed on my credit card statement that they did no such thing.  I call them back today to try for a resolution.  Again I was placed on hold this time only 25 minutes only to be told that the Branding Iron had attempted  to call me, but could not reach me. (my phone with good conductivity was with me all the time)  So I am left holding the bill.  I will never use either Expedia or the Branding Iron hotel and recommend caution to all who use their services.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	positive

The refund request ended up getting denied from the hotel.  After a couple emails and a call to a supervisor they gave me a coupon towards another hotel stay.

917	"            I booked a flight/hotel package through Expedia.com to Pittsburgh for 2 nights last weekend.  The reservation was made at least a week prior and was confirmed and paid for.  When we (myself and my 2 children) arrived at the hotel at 11pm after a very bumpy flight (which made my younger one sick), we found out that our reservation was cancelled because the hotel was overbooked.  ""Didn't Expedia contact you?"" asked the front desk staff.  I checked my phone - no message.  I checked my email and found an emailed sent to me that evening informing me about the cancellation.  The email came in while I was already on a plane.  After many minutes of on hold with Expedia, I was told there are no rooms to be had in Pittsburgh.  By then it was round midnight, I'm sitting in a parking lot in a rental car with 2 kids, one of them still shaky from the flight, with no place certain to go.  So I explained to the customer service rep. that I needed a reservation for the following night, and I'm going to drive to my in-law's house in Cleveland.  I didn't want to go over complaints/compensation at that time. After returning from the trip, I called Expedia.  After talking to customer service and explained the situation, I was offered a $100 voucher to be used for future Expedia bookings, and that is the best they can do.  After all that myself and my children went through, I find that insulting.  And the voucher is worth nothing since I won't be booking with them again.

I submitted my phone number for a call back since the automated system said it would be a 12 hour wait on the phone. Online, it said I was guaranteed a call back within 45 minutes. That was at about 9 a.m. and we just got a call at midnight - waking my husband from a sound sleep. Of course, they were unable to help since there wasn't a manager available at the hotel to fix the issue... So, even after being awakened, we have no resolution. I will NEVER use Expedia again. When I told the rep that it was midnight, and 12 hours later, she said ""we're experiencing a high volume of calls""... Apparently so - this was crazy.

Insurance only if you are 'disabled' ...apparently sick with flu doesn't count (nor does a state of emergency and hurricane at our destination).  I had to cancel the trip but totally lost money!!!

I initially spoke with a woman from Expedia telling me I had to contact the airline directly to cancel and that she had no control over it. So I did just that, I called the airline and they told me the same thing. If I booked through Expedia, I would have to cancel through them. That makes total sense! I call back now speaking with a different person. He Pulled my itinerary up and I told him my concern and mentioned that I talked to another person before this. I told him I just wanted to cancel this flight before the 24 hour cancellation fee period. He told me there was no ""documentation"" of this therefore he didn't know what I was talking about. He couldn't do anything because there was no documentation and if I cancelled there would be a fee. At this point, I was especially furious because the First Lady who I talked to specifically told me to hold on, I'm documenting blah blah. Then Where's the documentation! I then talked to a supervisor who wasn't even helpful and made me give him a play by play of what happened and then called the airline himself with me on hold. Good thing I asked for that first lady's name...NOT. As much as I mentioned her name, he still acted like I was crazy because there was no record of this conversation on their computer. Why would I make this up to waste my time and your time? Anyway fast forward 2 hours later and it being 2AM. I got my refund. But would I ever use this website again? No. why not make a simple cancellation...simple?        "	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
924	            On Sept. 15, 2016, I was searching for airline tickets. I thought I clicked on the flight I wanted. I followed through with the purchase still thinking I was getting the tickets I wanted. From the time I clicked on my selection I did not see the ticket info until it was sent to my e-mail. When I saw it was not the tickets I wanted, I called Expedia right away (within minutes)  to correct the error.They informed me since it was such a great deal it was their  policy that they can pick the ticket times  and the policy of the airline (Delta) that the ticket can not be changed. I informed them that I do not consider the total of $34.70 saving on the purchase of two (2) tickets so much of a savings.  I can understand if I had waited for days before I called but like I said I made the call with in minutes. I explained to Expedia why this chose of ticket they made was not a good one for us. I was told I could cancel  the ticket purchase  but I would loose my money. I than called Delta Corporate Office. They said it was ok with them to change the ticket put Expedia would have to be the one to do since the tickets was bought through them. I have flown with Delta a lot over the years, and never had this trouble before. I contacted both Expedia and Delta several more times. NO SATISFACTION.  Most of the time I have not had to change or cancel a ticket. But it has happened and Delta has always been very helpful. I called several days later and tried to reason with Expedia again. I got the  same response. I than told them I would just cancel the ticket and loose my money.  That is how bad this ticket chose is for us. I was than told I can not even cancel my tickets even knowing I would loose my money. So people just be aware of the fine print  and read every word and make contact by phone to ask questions before clicking on submit.Very dissatisfiedCynthia Williams        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative
925	            Good Morning.It is not acceptable to expect me to wait indefinitely. I have been trying to resolve this since June. With all the technology available in this day and age, Expedia are unable to give a PROMPT and EFFICIENT response. Expedia is deliberately treating me in the most EVIL and DISGUSTING MANNER. You are keeping me waiting, not knowing what going on since JUNE. It's the most EVIL, NASTY, MALICIOUS way to treat anyone. How can i contact your CEO ? No doubt you will not give me this information. How can I make a formal complaint i.e. what is your Complaints Handling Procedure? - WE have this is England, its is a Consumer Right for me to ask for this. When I asked for your Complaints Handling Procedure many months ago, I was told that you are not authorised to email me. Yes I am FRUSTRATED. Yes I am very disappointed with the disgusting level of service. Yours Sincerely,Mr. P. VerdiT: 0797044240Good Morning.Itinerary : 110944805392 &amp; 110945252611Last Friday, I received an email from Expedia, advising that I should wait five more days. It has now been six days and despite being told IN WRITING via email that you would contact me in FIVE days, NO ONE from Expedia has contacted me. Its clear now that when I originally booked I was NOT told that Expedia cannot book NINE tickets together. That is why you have split up my Family for the return journey from Montreal to London. I have spent over TWENTY hours on the phone SINCE JUNE trying to sort this out. Most of the time Expedia simply keep me on 'hold'. I have sent many, many emails in an effort to get both families to travel together on both outward and return journeys. I have phone records and copies of my emails to prove. Quite simply its clear that Expedia have got my payment for the tickets: (£6000) and now simply don't care. I have been extremely patient and polite, throughout. It is seems that Expedia have a policy of deliberately  not being helpful. Your service is terrible. The worst I have ever encountered. Its clear that Expedia have a policy of deliberately keeping callers on hold - in the hope that problems with Travellers will simply 'go away'. You do the same with emails, deliberately either not answering or delaying you response. I am disgusted and will make every effort to MAKE PUBLIC how badly I have been treated. I will use TWITTER / FACEBOOK / TRIP ADVISOR to help other travellers avoid Expedia due to terrible service. Nine adults are due to fly on the 15th October and since JUNE Expedia are unable to get us all on the same outward and return flights, as I originally agreed with your sales staff. It cannot possibly take Expedia that long to resolve this matter. I have to assume that Expedia are deliberately spoiling my holiday and have no intention of making any effort to sort this out. I am so frustrated and disgusted with Expedia, words alone cannot explain.If you have the decency and any tiny sense of customer service you need to SORT THIS OUT NOW!!!Mr. VerdiMb: 07970442409.        	                2	1	Friday	expedia	negative

927	            I went to Kayak to book a room at the Quality Inn in Minden, NV.  Kayak directed me to Expedia.  It said the room rate was $82 and I was a member so I would earn points.  I also checked Choice Hotels and found the same room for $82 for 4 people.  I clicked on book it to see what total rate was and it was $81.59 plus 10% tax for Douglas County.  I trusted Expedia and booked it through them.  I put in 2 adults and 2 children, but when it was booked it said 4 adults and the room rate was $81.59 plus Expedia charged me an extra $20 for an extra guest (room max is 4 and that is what I had) plus they charged more than the county room tax of 10%, they charged over $13.  I called Expedia and after much hold time and much transferring I was told it was the Quality Inn that set the rate and that they could do nothing since I got the non-cancellable room rate.  I drove down to the Quality Inn to talk to them and they said they had many phone calls from Expedia but that they charged me the $114.80 for the room because they have to charge what Expedia sends over.  No one can do a thing about my $25 overcharges.  Quality Inn said that Expedia tacked on the $20 and also commission fees and that there wasn't anything I can do.  Expedia gave me a $50 credit to be used on their website but who would want to use them again, buyer beware.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

I just spoke with a customer service representative supervisor named Gerald about canceling my non-refundable reservations (which was made on the wrong weekend by accident). The amount of patience and above board customer service that he displayed was beyond anything I have ever experienced. He waited on hold (on two separate occasions) with hotels, emailed the managers, and helped me to get a full refund. Although it was a long process and I had to speak with a few other representives before I got this level of service, Gearld himself earns the company 5 stars.

933	"            Booked a trip for 4 to Jamaica.  Problems began with airplane mechanical delay resulting in missed connections.  Spent two hours on phone with Expedia's foreign representative (literally had to ask dozens of times to repeat what she was saying because it was not understandable) who should have told me from the beginning to contact the airline directly to resolve my issue.  After two hours, mostly holding, was connected to airline and problem was immediately resolved.  Secondly, had a problem with hotel booking as well, again had to call Expedia (you are left no option but to call).  Again connected with someone who spoke very poor English and spent over an hour on hold, only this time using expensive international minutes.  They say they will call you back if you are disconnected, which they do not - as we were in a remote area and lost connection twice. This time, Expedia did have to make the change for me, but charged me $179 to do so when it should have cost nothing.  I was actually due a refund because I was charged for an upgrade I did not receive.  I have requested this refund and have not even received a response acknowledging my request.They take advantage of the fact that you are at their mercy once your travel begins.   The entire trip was nothing like what I was ""sold"" on their site.  I will NEVER NEVER NEVER book through Expedia again!

944	            Booked a week away to the Algarve with Expedia. They seemed good to deal with. However when we got our bill  by email we had paid €15 euro more than we were quoted for holiday.The strange thing is that when we booked with Expedia  it was over the phone and was the same price as online. We phoned Expedia back to tell them they overcharged us and they said we will have to download and send proof by PDF. What is P.D.F. and we have not go no joy after sending various emails.  I know it is only €15 but they seem to be overcharging a lot of customers. We will never use Expedia again. Well done Expedia.        	                9	1	Friday	expedia	neutral
945	            I've made countless reservations for hotels, flights, car rentals, etc. I know how to shop online and I'm very good at price comparing between sites. Expedia is the first and only company that I feel grabbed my money right out of my hand. While trying to book a hotel where their rate was the same as another site, I proceeded to enter my payment info in order to get the final price with taxes and fees. The other website was already showing me the rate and the breakdown of fees before my payment info. Well no sooner did I do that and click the button to go to what I thought was a confirmation page than it said my booking was complete! The charges went well over $300, whereas the other site was $291 including all taxes and fees. And since it was a non refundable rate, they couldn't do anything for me. Neither could the hotel unfortunately. Never use Expedia or their affiliate reservations.com        	                2	1	Wednesday	expedia	positive

948	"            Worst customer service ever. I had a hotel booked for a Bruce Springsteen concert in VA yesterday 9/3. We were informed yesterday a.m that concert was rescheduled to 9/5 due to inclement weather from Hurricane Hermine. I called Expedia 5 times yesterday to change the hotel to the new night. The first time I called it was a 3 hour wait. The second time was a 2 hour wait (I left my number for them to call me back.)  The third time I called it was a 5 hour wait (left my number again). So I went online to customer service and left my number online for them to call me (it said ""we will call you within 15 minutes.) The fourth time I called was a 6 hour wait. So I went online to customer service again and left my number again (it said ""we will call you within 20 minutes.) And the fifth and final time I called was a whopping 10 hour and 16 minute wait. Are you EFFING kidding me????  So from 9:30am until almost 5pm i continuously tried to contact them with no response. I called the hotel I was suppose to stay at to explain everything that was going on and they apparently had no authority to change the reservation since expedia booked the hotel and I paid for it already, but they told me to call back today to talk to their manager. So i was furious that I was potentially going to lose $103 all because Expedia doesn't have the decency to help their customers. I understand you're busy, but to hear that its going to be a 10 hr wait after I had been calling since 930 am was just beyond ridiculous. I should have been called back after the 2 hour wait time since I was ""in line"" as they say. It's just ridiculous. So I called the manager of the hotel today and he said that he would honor my reservations since it was already paid for and since I still wanted to come. So luckily I did not lose my money but I will never use expedia ever again.        "	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
949	            Well I have to hand it to you expedia you are a finely tuned machine of screwing the customer for money. Working in a cabal with the airlines to double screw us poor unsuspecting customers.I purchased 2 round trip tickets only needing 1 for myself and a 1way for my fiance to the US. It just was cheaper, I called expedia who then informed me that it was okay to just no show for the first half of my fiancee flight. Upon checking the airline rules for myself I found out that if one customer is a no show for the first half of those flight the rest of the flight WILL THEN BE CANCELED. I almost went through with this, can you imagine me and my fiance ready to go back to the US only to find that her ticket had been CANCELED?! Omg. Now after 2.5 hrs of phone calls with CS expedia couldn't help me find a cheap ticket to my price range I bought them for. And now look the flights 2 months away and the prices have doubled. Hmmm sure would've been helpful to know this months ago when I first bought the tickets for cheap. Now I'm stuck paying double or changing my dates to further out to save more money. Never again expedia.Customer service was as helpful as they could be they don't make the rules they just have to deal with us irritated people. Sorry to them. They don't deserve it. And worst of all most of them love in poor countries and this is the best job they can get. So just remember to treat your CS rep with respect, they are just trying to make a living like you.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	positive

Rather stupid of Expedia as I still have the original confirmation of the booking ""including the original Kings Cross hotel address""!!!, from Expedia to me ""as evidence"" sent to Expedia &amp; the CEO well over 50 times -  thus the CEO is aware of the FRAUD &amp; seems to support it, which is a criminal offence carrying a prison sentence.2) Expedia is, ignoring ""the"" email sent to me informing me that you (Expedia) had changed the hotel address from London Kings Cross to Harrow (over 13 miles distance!!!) only hours before I was due to check in.  Evidence of deception.I have sent copies of these two emails to Expedia, well over 50 times (and kept a record of all communications). Further evidence that Expedia ignores customer complaints.  To summarise. Expedia:-1) tried to deceive me (the customer) for financial gain.2) is trying really hard to cover the deception3) have ignored my complaints &amp; evidence emails included in my communications.

On August 12, 2016 I happen to call Dynamic Airway to make sure our flight was still on and I found out that our return flight was canceled.  Nobody made us aware of this cancelation.  I spent the whole day on the phone with Expedia and they told me that there was absolutely nothing that they could do for me, they told me my only 2 options are to cancel my trip all together or get half of my money back and figure out how to get back from Punta Cana, D.R. on my own.  Expedia said that even though I booked my whole trip through them they are not responsible for what happened and tried to help my group to find a returning flight but told us we would have to pay $500 each extra on top of what we already paid for the trip just days before we were suppose to leave.  Obviously we could not afford this being that since March we've gotten our passports, shopped for the trip and saved up money for our excursions.  I had never booked with Expedia but the others who I was traveling with have used them in the past and never had an issue.  This is why we thought we would be okay flying Dynamic Airways even though we had never heard of the airline, at least we knew our booking was through Expedia and they were a pretty reputable company.  Needless to say we were wrong, tomorrow we should be on an airplane flying to paradise to relax for a couple of days celebrating me being cancer free and graduating nursing school but we aren't and not because of something on our part because we did what we were suppose to but because Dynamic Airway dropped the ball and Expedia takes no accountability for the situation.

When I mentioned that her agent just told me he saw the reservation I booked was for Sun 14th she denied it and promptly re-ticketed me and tried to conclude the call.

The fact is no one called the fact is this unethical conduct; ticketing me for what you have instead of the itinerary requested ( BTW AA listed the flight 88 on 14th as unavailable when I purchased the itinerary on Expedia) things will happens and go wrong but be honest with your clients and hire people who can resolve conflict not escalate it.I have one more already purchased flight itinerary with Expedia but it will be my last.

I was ready to book online when it gets to the final page, website say cannot book online please call Expedia so I did.Told the agent what I wanted and he advised that he CANNOT book premium economy class (not because is not available) is because Expedia cannot get this booking, what he suggested was that I book this as economy class then he would transfer me to a Sales Support Team who WOULD able to upgrade my tickets to premium economy, yes I know I would have to pay extra for the the next class that was not an issues, however, once I'd got transferred thru to the  Sales Support Team the agent asked if I'd contact the airline directly?!?! Why would I contact airline direct when I'm told Expedia can upgrade me to premium class??? So it turns out Expedia CANNOT book any other class apart from economy!!!! Even if their website gives you that options and pop out a price!!!!Sales Support agent said this will now class as a ""change"" to tickets and it would mean additional fee to change my tickets which is not what I asked for in the first place. Sales Support agent said ok it is their sales agent providing faults information he would issues me a full refund on the same day as this booking so I assumed everything would be fine.Naive I did not get a reference number, two days later I contacted Expedia again and was told I should get my refund back into my account with 48hrs. Two days later still nothing so called expedia again, recap the whole experience, was provided a case reference and again the promise the case and refund will be look into, 48hrs later still  nothing, called Expedia again, re-cap everything above and I'm told they cannot get hold of the hotel reservation due to time different to get a refund, I'm now having to wait till Monday and will be spending my Monday morning calling up expedia again and each time I spent an hour on the phone with agent who promises they will  personally deal/handle this case, not so because no action was ever taken unless I call to chase it up.Expedia agent who provided faults information in the first place i'm entitle to a full refund so WHY do I have to wait for Expedia to get confirmation from hotel to receive my refund????I was told two days ago my flights was refunded but I'm still waiting for this to reflect on my credit card!!!!!To be continue ........

978	            I got booked into a Howard Johnson in Austin. After checking in and getting to my room, I noticed the room was filthy and smelt moldy. It was late, so I consigned myself to suffer the night. At 11:45 I went down to the lobby to pick up a pizza I ordered, only to be cursed out by the lobby attendant, and threatened to be thrown out of I didn't leave the lobby immediately. I was only there for two minutes. I called Expedia, because this was unacceptable. After being transferred to 4 different agents, I found out, not only could I not cancel my reservation, I couldn't get a refund, and I was put on hold for almost 20 minutes while the looked for a different hotel for me to stay in. I eventually just gave up and slept with the door locked. I'm reporting the Howard Johnson to the corporate office and the BBB. This was the worst experience ever only compiled by the booking companies inability to help put me in a different hotel, as the one I was in was not as advertised.Expedia is worthless.

For some reason, this hotel was booked as a ""guest"" and not under my name and therefore never showed up on my itinerary.I have now spoken to 3 people through Expedia who don't speak English well and I've had to tell this problem over and over again.  I was also told by the 1st agent I spoke to that I would be fully refunded.

982	            I booked and paid for a trip in January that I took in May. I paid extra for insurance since I knew in that time plans may need to change a little due to my husband's work schedule. I called to change a flight and they charged me $400 per flight (his leave and return), and claimed they would return $200 each since I had the insurance. Turns out they cancelled our original booking entirely and changed all four of our flights charging $400 per change ($1200 total) and put us on flights that were fully booked in addition to being incorrect times/dates! Luckily I checked this before heading to the airport. They admitted the mistake but I was on the phone with them for over 6 hours the day before we were supposed to leave trying to fix it. I FINALLY reached someone helpful who booked us on new flights which I paid for (another $2000) that they claimed they would provide a return for. I received nothing back and had to call them again when I returned and it took three days and a lot of arguing to get all but $200 back, which I honestly just gave up on because between the four days I had to deal with their customer service I was on hold for 24 hours total!I was a gold member with their credit card but all has been cancelled, I have used them for years with only minor issues but after this I will never book through them again, even if they are the cheapest.

They said to try back later.  Today is the next day which is later and the flight went up 45% because of me trying to book the flight ( which should be illegal).  Since their site glitched it cost me a lot more money so I called CS back to tell them what happened and instead of even trying to help or give a future discount they just told me ""No we will not change any price even if our website glitches"". Use a company for years and will not even fix something when it was their error.  Very poor and sad customer service to say the least.  They lost a customer forever because part of having a business is to the support you offer and they lack all support when they need to come to a resolution on something.  They should go out of business and people should stop using them for any of their travel needs.        "	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative

985	            I recently double booked with Expedia, when I called before the 24 expiration, they say I can only cancel the air fare but to get the hotel cancel they will have to contact the hotel since it's a no refund or cancellation. I receive a email that the flight was cancelled and it's almost a month and the money not in my account. When it comes down to the hotel I called Expedia everyday to see the status on the hotel cancellation. One agent say that I was eligible since I booked for the same timeframe and the same hotel so it should be fine. Even in Jamaica, I spoke with a manager at the hotel and she said i would receive the refund. When I return home I got an email from Expedia that the hotel say I wasn't eligible to get a refund. Now I'm paying for the hotel twice and I only stayed once. They didn't even give me a credit for year for the extra booking. Expedia was even charging my card $1 four times and when I asked they had no reason for it. Now My credit card company is involved.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	neutral

We get there and the gal informs us there is no vacancy and that Expedia overbooked our room. Call Expedia and the representative says its not their fault and the hotel is lying! The hotel has a ""no vacancy"" sign. Then he tells me he will refund the money and it should be back in our account in 5 days! Then he says he is emailing me a $50 coupon to use Expedia again... Well the coupon never came through and the next cheapest hotel on Expedia was $350!!! Even with a $50 coupon that's $150 more than what we originally wanted. We were needing a place to shower and change BC it was our 10 year anniversary. It was already 7:00 when we got to hotel with no vacancy + an hour on phone with Expedia (ridiculous)... Then by the time we left and drove 45 more minutes to another hotel that was cheaper(and not through Expedia)... It was almost 9:00 pm before we got showers and left to eat!  I tried calling Expedia again  to talk to a manager and was left on hold for 30 plus minutes. I finally hung up...

988	            We booked Expedia last year for hour holiday in Asia when an unexpected event happened. We ended up spending our holiday in a hospital. My husband was adviced for confinement and his release was uncertain. I called Expedia and ask to cancel our booking because my husband will still be in the hospital on the date we're supposed to stay in a hotel we booked thru Expedia. But Expedia told me they can't cancel my booking because it's less than 48 hours and it's hotel policy and there's nothing the can do. Expedia told me to change the date or have my relatives stay on the booked date. I disagree with their options because my case was emergency and they should bend that policy. Expedia told me there's nothing they can do. I was fortunate that my sister-in-law happened to have an email address of one of the hotel manager. I contacted the hotel and explained our situation. My request for cancellation was granted and was told that what Expedia did to us is not the way they do business. I have to call Expedia again to give them our cancellation confirmation. It was very stressful for us emotionally, mentally and financially and Expedia was inconsiderate. We travel every year and used to use Expedia but I will avoid booking this agency again even if there's $100. difference. It's not worth it to book with them.

Both companies are fail to be honest with what was covered by my reservation! I will never book anything through Expedia again! They were not sorry or wanted to admit thrifty rental does not except there coverage that is charged as part of the reservation.

998	            I booked a special trip for a surprise. I couldn't find direct flights on line so called Expedia and spoke to Khartik on the 17/7. I also was looking at excursions and he lied saying they would be cheaper to book through him. I asked for specific days however he said there was no need as they were valid for the duration of my trip wrong another lie. He then proceeded to book 2 trips on the same day for the same time on a day I was flying into Rome at a time that I was in the air and not even in the country never mind to places at the same time! I only knew this when I was sent the confirmation not what he promised. When I called Expedia I was left to tears of frustration as Dham and then Veejay both so called managers refused to amend the mistake until they'd listened to the call. After many hours of arguing they eventually agreed to email the vendor and promised to call me tonight as you guessed NO CALL. Then on top of everything the shuttle I booked with imbecile Khartik emailed me yesterday directly to advise me that Expedia had missed all my details from the booking. I was then subjected to another call yesterday to get you to put this right. The lady I spoke to put that right and said you'd received confirmation that the bookings had been amended. She also submitted a second complaint. Then today the excursion company emailed me and told me they were confused as they had 5 bookings for me and could I let them know the correct dates and times again Expedia made a very big mistake which I've had to again amend myself.I'm also upset as the excursion company very kindly moved the Vatican trip to 9am as Khartik couldn't be bothered to tell me when I was worrying how far the Vatican was and thought I'd need time to get there that my accommodation was actually only 300 yards from the Vatican entrance. I have therefore lost money as the 9am tour is £20 cheaper.I am disgusted with Expedia and the way they have handled their mistake or the lack of handling it.I have had no communication or apology.I will never book with them again and that Khartik should be sacked what should have been a happy time has been a nightmare        	                2	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

1001	            I booked a Vacation package with Expedia 7/6/16 Itinerary No.: 1139794051931.  The package promised $400 in 'Resort Credits'.  When I called to verify what a 'Resort Credit' was, I was told on arrival you will receive $400 in vouchers.  Satisfied I booked the package.  Later that evening while reviewing the confirmation email my wife noticed the Vouchers were not mentioned. We called back and were informed that we misunderstood and that the 'Resort Credit' was really a discount on the room rate.  We immediately requested a cancellation.  We were told we should see the refund in about 7 days.Two weeks later I noticed the airfare portion was not refunded.  I called customer service 7/18/16 4:00pm and after answering several questions was told the original reimbursement was not entered properly and instead of me waiting online 40 minutes for a 'supervisor' to correct it, they took my number and promised to call back.  Two hours later after not receiving a phone call I called again.  This time I was told it takes 'my bank' two billing cycles to show a refund.  I stated 'you don't know where I bank' so how can you tell me my bank's policy?'  I was then put on hold to await a supervisor. An hour later a supervisor came on line and told me to be patient while they worked on it and then promptly hung up on me.

Only one room at another hotel was available so I made the reservation which was confirmed and an itinerary number was received. When he arrived to the hotel about midnight, he was told that the Expedia reservation didn’t get accepted. The hotel was sold out and he had to search for another hotel to stay for the night.The full charge for his 3-day stay was already pending on his credit card the next morning. I called to get the charge reversed and the Expedia agent put me hold for over 30 minutes. When she finally got back on the line it was to tell me she was unable to reach the hotel desk. She then told me she would send an “email to the support team” to continue to contact the hotel before Expedia would reverse the charge which could take up to 24 hours. After waiting another day, I called back, was placed on hold again while the agent attempted to contact the hotel. Another 30 minutes passed before my case was escalated to a 2nd level supervisor who finally was able to process the refund.This process took 4 days to be resolved which is completely unacceptable.

When I entered my check out date the website jumped ahead several days.  I fixed it twice, then checked to see if multiple nights were required to reserve.  Multiple nights were not necessary, I fixed the check out date and entered my reservation.  On my confirmation Expedia booked me for 3 nonrefundable nights when I only wanted 1.  Within 4 minutes I was on the phone with an Expedia representative.  I explained the situation, waited a while on hold and when he returned I was told that he had spoken to a manager and then ASSURED me that this would be taken care of and that they would send me a $50 certificate for my trouble.  Very, very nice. Easy.Two days later I get an email that the hotel is holding me to the reservation (not their fault). I email Expedia to explain, they tell me to call 1-800-EXPEDIA.  I call, request a supervisor, get put on hold for 10 minutes, then get disconnected.  I call back, request a supervisor and the representative says, ""IF WE GET DISCONNECTED, IS THIS THE NUMBER YOU WOULD LIKE US TO CALL YOU BACK ON?""  After 24 minutes of holding, I hangup.  Within a minute, the representative CALLS ME BACK.  I ask her to have a supervisor call me and again, I email Expedia to explain and ask for a supervisor to call.  NO JOKE, I get an email back saying that supervisors cannot make outgoing calls!  Really?  Representatives can make outgoing calls, but supervisors cannot?  I requested a direct number to speak to a supervisor.  No response.  No help.  They tell me to call the 800 number.Expedia does not want to stand behind their product.  They will not admit to a computer error.  They will not stand behind their original promise to take care of the situation, and they are making no attempt to rectify the situation.I always did all of my travel bookings with Expedia.  The site is easy to use and fortunately never needed help from them.  Now that I needed help with THEIR mistake, they are unwilling to help.  It is a scary world right now.  You may need to change plans.  It would be nice to know that Expedia has your back.  If you are away, are you going to want to spend 25 minutes on your cellphone trying to get through to Expedia?  By the way, there have been 17 emails back and forth, most of Expedia's are auto generated from telling me how much they value me and to call the 800 number. Are you going to want empty promises?  Before you book, do your homework and book with a company that provides excellent customer service.PS- They never sent the $50 certificate either...big surprise!

It means i can only travel between Mon-Thu and not between Fri-Sun. I argue a lot but he keeps telling me its airline rule.... I told you charge penalty and airfare difference then why i cant fly during weekend and the answer was simple from them is - Airline policy don't allow you to fly... what a ridiculous answer from their specialist.4. I called airline - Emirates - I had agent in 1 min, she got all my data in 2 min and my call ended in 5 min with the clear answer that Emirates don't have anything for my ticket which prevent me to fly in weekend.5. I called 4 times and every time i get a message from their 800 that - We are getting frequent  call from your number and we are prioterizing your call to directly with our specialist. I keep hearing music for 45- 60 min to wait specialist and nothing happen.Right now, i am putting real-time feedback where i am on call with agent who took all my details in 45 min. and waiting for specialist. when i ask how much time will it take for specialist and she checked and told me around 45 min to 1hour. this means if i will get specialist today and HOPE my ticket change plan will get resolved then I may end-up spending almost 3 hours continue on phone with Expedia..... my ears are paining with their waiting music !!!!Never ever use Expedia, better go directly with airlines where you get better and clear answer.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive
1011	            They are polite. However, they are also very inefficient. For a simple name change, I was on the phone with them for over 3 hours during the span of 2 days. I had to call the airlines and call Expedia back to make sure they filed the appropriate paperwork to get this done. The airline told me it could have easily been done sooner, but Expedia's help center seemed to be clueless about name change procedures. Even their supervisor, who took down my contact info did not call back when I got disconnected. We'll see how the rest of this goes, but already a rough start. Even if you get in touch with a representative in less than 3 minutes, what use is it when they constantly put you on hold to go ask their higher up questions for 15 minutes at a time?        	                2	2	Tuesday	expedia	neutral
1012	            This was my most frustrating Trip book on Expedia. First, I have booked my trip 2 months prior the date of depart.  On the day of travel while I was at the airport Expedia sent me an email that there was a problem with my reservation. I called in and one of your representative told me that everything was fixed and I can proceed to destination. On arrival to hotel, I found out that nothing was fixed. The hotel told be to contact Expedia. I spoke with at least 7 people from Expedia. Everytimes, I am on hold while they are talking to the manager, I was transferred to a new agent and have to explain the whole story again.  While they are talking to the hotel manager, the line get disconnected. I spent 5 hrs in the hotel lobby (in Mexico) with 2 crying infants and 2 children who were starving from the long trip.None of Expedia agent has an extension to be reached back in case of disconnection. None of then call back when their calls were disconnected or when they have finished talking to the manager. Even after talking to 7 people at Expedia trying to resolve the issue, nothing was done. They did not even try to amend their mistake and get us a second room but was trying to place us in a different hotel.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

1015	            Expedia has proven to be totally incompetent in handling my travel plans.  I had to cancel a flight and rebook it.  They have totally mismanaged this efffrot and cannot get my reservation correct.  Moreover, trying to deal with their customer service is infuriating.  Currently I am on Day 3 trying to get this issue resolved.  Day I was 1 hour 45 minutes; they said everything was in order.  I never received an email confirmation so I called the airline only to find out Expedia never completed the transaction.  Day 2 was 1 hour 30 minutes; after which they stated all was well.  Next day I get a notice that my flight has been cancelled due to inaction on Expedia's part.  Today is Day 3.  I expressed my dissatisfaction and my need to speak with a manager.  Currently I have been on hold for 1 hour 5 minutes; and still waiting.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative

The hotel (Quality Inn and Suites, 3200 West Broad Street, Richmond, VA, 23230) was described as Very Good! 3.6 of 5 (719 Reviews) on the Choice Hotels website, but was far from it (caution tape around the exterior of building, ceiling tiles falling off, filthy room and bathroom). After some knucklehead pulled the fire alarm at 8:00 am, we checked out two days early. Neither the hotel management nor Expedia provided any refund, nor offered anything other than ""Sorry - that's how it works.""

For the other 2 I had to go through a process:- Call expedia, an international call that cost a lot of money and took several minutes;- Be told that I need to deal directly with the airline;- Call the airline, another long international phone call.One of the airlines (Eurowings) sent me an email with a refund receipt 6 days ago, but still no refund.The other airline (Wow Air) simply refused to give me a refund. I called Expedia again and customer service said they can't do anything.

1022	"            I just do not learn my lesson!!!!!! Expedia is by far the worse travel booking company in the world. Let's start off with my first bad experience from my Las Vegas trip June 2015. So my flight leaves me bc they changed the departure time with absolutely NO email stating this changed from Expedia. THEN I had to wait 12 hours in the Las Vegas airport bc Expedia could not help me what so ever in booking a new flight. Every time I called the phone call dropped or they would leave me on hold for OVER an hour. Ok that was my first bad experience which should of right then and there been a red flag, ok I didn't learn me lesson yet. Second incident... I booked a birthday weekend getaway with my friends to Curaçao in April unfortunately my close friend passed away and I could not make that trip but the rest of the girls were still going. So I called Expedia to cancel ONLY my flight (since everything is always booked under my gold status Expedia account) but guess what their GRADE A customer representatives cancelled the whole trip when I specified I wanted to cancel MY flight ONLY. And all she could say was oops I canceled everything. So I had to deal with  having to ""patiently"" wait for the representative to fix the mess she made while being an emotional wreck and on my way to one of my closets and dearest friend's funeral... You would think that would be the end of that but NO. Strike three... Yesterday July 1st 2016 my flight to Tampa (booked through Expedia) got delayed 3 times before getting finally getting canceled. I called Expedia to see what can be done because it was highly important for me to make it to Tampa in the am. I called and the call drops two times... Finally on the third call I get to speak to someone who then gives me the only solution according to them for me to make it on time... Pay 800 dollars for a new flight leaving in the morning!!!! The nerve when I had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that the flight got cancelled. The people working customer service in Expedia are THE WORSE!!!!! Please do not book through Expedia they do not care to help their customers at all even when you're a loyal customer. You'll be wasting valuable time, money, and patience. They are rude and inconsiderate. Be warned DO NOT BOOK with EXPEDIA!        "	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

They messed up on out tickets on our way there making me slend 10 hrs on the phone trying to reschedule a flight, from the airport after our first fight. Then on our way back home them said they had our tickets confirmed and it eas not! So we had to a hotel to wait for another flight!

1025	"            I have been trying to book a hotel with Expedia for over 4 days now. I have been back and forth with Expedia ""customer service"" for the past 2 days. If you try calling them, the machine hangs up on you constantly and you can't even talk to a real person. My issue? I was given a $25 off coupon if I booked through the mobile app. I went to book through the mobile app and it just said ""Sorry, but we're having a problem. Please try again"". Not only is the error bad English, but the responses I've gotten from their customer service are equally as bad. They don't even READ your concern! It is as if they just get a general idea of your issue and copy paste something from a help book. I told them I was having trouble redeeming my coupon code, so 26 hours later I get a response of how to put in my coupon code. Really helpful. I sent another email, 28 hours later they sent an email explaining why I might experience issues booking on their website. Like....are you serious?! I feel completely ignored. Talking to their customer service is like talking to a wall. You don't even get any sort of intelligent response. It's absolutely ridiculous. I booked with a different website, and said screw the coupon. Stay away from Expedia, these customer service reps never graduated grade school. Also, Orbitz seems to be owned by Expedia or vice-versa. So might be in your best interest to stay away from both. Thanks Expedia, for 4 days of headaches.

1030	"            Expedia customer service is appalling!! I booked a roundtrip ticket from Australia to the States for my fiancee to come visit. We decided to extend her stay a bit and contacted Expedia to change the departure date. This is where the ""Twilight Zone"" music should queue in... First off, they had absolutely NO record of her departing Australia, so at first they told us that they couldn't change her return flight because they didn't have record of her boarding her departure flight from Australia. After I suggested that they contact United Airlines (the provider of the flights), they gave out a heavy sigh and said, ""Fine"". Then they got back on the line and said they could change the flight for an OUTRAGEOUS amount of money...(I literally choked when they told me). I said, ""There has to be some mistake....a fare difference couldn't be that much. What I need you to do is to check all K Class tickets for such and such a date.""....again with the heavy sigh and ""Fine"". When they got back on the line, they quoted me a price that was ALOT more reasonable (funny how I know their job better than they do, huh?) Because I didn't feel like dealing with the representative's attitude any longer, I asked to talk to a supervisor. NEVER ask to talk to a supervisor, unless you want a 2+ hour wait on the line. When the supervisor finally got on the line, they informed me that there would be an additional $50 Double Agency fee because they had to contact United directly to CLARIFY THEIR MISTAKE of not having proper record keeping. I said, ""excuse me?....you are going to charge me $50 for YOUR mess up?"" They informed me that the fee came from United. Again....me doing their job, I suggested that they communicate the issue with a United Supervisor fully about WHY they had to contact United in the first place, in order to get the fee waived. At which point, the SUPERVISOR of EXPEDIA suggested that I talk to them myself, and before I could say a word, they put me on hold and when someone picked the line back up...it was United. NOT a United Supervisor, but just a regular ticketing agent....and this Expedia SUPERVISOR had literally just blew me off. I spent 30mins directly with United and got everything sorted out with a price that was HUNDREDS of dollars cheaper than what Expedia was offering. HORRIBLE company, with bloated fees, and HORRIBLE customer service.        "	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

I travel a lot and have always done my own booking for flights, cars, hotels, etc...My wife and I were headed to Mexico for a little over a week and I thought I'd give Expedia a try...mainly so that all the bookings could be done in one place to make it easier.First problem: We booked about 3 months ahead of the trip. Everything seemed to be going together well. A couple of days before the trip I checked in online with Expedia to check our itinerary and found that the last leg of our return flight had been changed...by several hours. We had not been notified of the change. I then spent several hours on the phone with their service reps trying to fix the problem. At one point I told them they needed to fix the problem and then call me back with the solution. They did call back but had no solution. Seems they had received the flight change notice from American a couple of months ago but neglected to advise us. I escalated the problem in writing but never heard back from them.Second Problem: For the return trip I could not get the check in process to work. I again escalated the problem and never heard a word from Expedia.So...now I've used Expedia once and will never use them again. They are not reliable, and don't answer escalated requests.

Expedia booked for a 5 seater vehicle instead! How they think 9 can get into 5 seats I do not know. Rang their customer services (which is an Indian call centre) and they suggested that I cancel the booking. I am travelling in 2 days time!!!! That is the only suggestion they can make. I have looked for availability and there is none. They now suggest I get 2 cars. How I am meant to drive 2 at the same time is anyone's guess. Totally unacceptable. Never book with them again. I would have arrived with my passengers expecting to pick up a 9 seater and been stranded. Incompetent idiots. How do they get away with it! I will not be cancelling my booking and I will be taking this matter to the courts for compensation. Let that be a warning to anyone who is thinking of using this company.

1034	            I've been a Loyal customer of Expedia for some time now however I won't ever be using their services ever again!!! I booked a flight from Chicago to Tokyo and another flight from Tokyo to KL. However when I reached the airport in Chicago I was not allowed to board the Air Canada flight as the check-in staff told me I needed a Canadian visa to transit in Toronto, which came as a shock as I was not given any notice or advice regarding this from Expedia. So having missed my flight I contacted customer service looking for a refund or for them to put me on a different flight instead I was constantly told it had been my fault for not reading the T&amp;C when it is standard practice for any airline to inform you of any visa requirements. After about an hour of arguing, I hung up in frustration. After a while I got a call back from the supervisor with more bad news, it seemed that because I didn't manage to catch my flight in Chicago my other ticket to Kuala Lumpur was void as well, however the supervisor assured me that They will try and work with the airlines to get a refund. After catching a different more expensive flight to Tokyo. I had waited 2 days however I was not contacted at all and decided to call up again, which turned out to be a complete waste of time as I was put on hold or transferred for 1 hr and got hung up right as I was talking to the supervisor. Frustrated and angry I called back and was put on hold and transferred around for 1/2 hr and just as I was being connected to a supervisor they hung up again on me. So I decided to go a different route and try emailing them instead, it was an even bigger waste of time as I got an automated response telling me that they would respond within 72 hours, It's been a week and I haven't heard anything from them. In summary even if the tickets are slightly cheaper don't ever use them, they don't care at all about the customer and will throw you under the bus if any problems arise.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

I would be traveling with my family myself, wife, a 4 and 6 year old. Both children like to sleep with my wife and I while traveling. I was told the reservation was set for  a suite with a king size bed so we all could sleep comfortably together and I and my wife could do work after the children went to sleep. When I got the confirmation the room was for a suite with a queen size bed and if possible a king size bed at the discretion of the hotel. I then called back George from Expedia who told me that he was sorry and told me that Charmain was one of Expedia's weakest employees and he apologized profusely for her actions and told me he would get me a supervisor ASAP. In the next 15 minutes while I waited for a supervisor I had called the same hotel and booked a room for a suite with a king sized bed and was giving my credit card number without the help of Expedia when Gilbert Z. a supervisor from Expedia came on the line and I ask him to hold so I could finish giving the hotel my credit card number and he told me if you do not want to speak to me I am go to hang up. I then canceled my reservation with Expedia and completed my travel plans on my own with the same hotel that Expedia set up for a lower charge than Expedia was going to charge me. I then called Ray another supervisor at Expedia to ask for a phone call from a live person to express my concern and she stated she could not assure me a live person has the time to call me.

1038	            We booked our last minute weekend getaway through Expedia to the MGM grand hotel Las Vegas, Nevada. We did have an issue with our return flight missing our connecting flight due to delays, and the AA helped us get on WestJet direct flight to Toronto or we would have to wait for another day which would not have worked in our favour. Expedia gave us $100 credit to use within the year for our inconvenience. (thanks, Expedia, and American Airlines.)From Toronto, Ontario the cost of the trip with the flight and room for three nights was $1000 Canadian! Great deal, but the bed in our room, in the West Wing, was not up to our standard. (poor pillows and sunken mattress). No fridge in the room and the AC vent was right next to our head embedded in the night table. The next day the MGM Grand Hotel service representative April was awesome! She upgraded our room to a larger room for $15 a night. Total $30 US dollars! Not bad for a better room in the newer part of the hotel! The hotel is only a $12-13 taxi ride from the airport. The taxis are available around the clock as the airport is fairly busy, but they have many drivers and taxis available for transport so we moved through the line quickly. We did get buffet free for two people for one of our days stay at the hotel. The buffet would have cost $60US for two people. (not bad price but nicer that it was free with our Expedia package!) Overall, a fantastic hotel close to Vegas Strip, airport, clubs and has a lot of activities. It was a great price for a last minute getaway (thanks, Expedia!).        	                1	4	Wednesday	expedia	positive
1039	            Expedia kept me waiting for 2-3 hours for 3-4 times for change of BA flight. Not accepted to change it and instead ask me to book fresh booking  with no credit to offer for my existing booking. I talked to BA airlines and they have done it. worst experience.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	neutral
1040	            I HATE Expedia! Those people are the most inept, uneducated, bunch of cheats I have ever seen! I've spent at least 7 hours total on the phone with at least 5 different representatives over the past three days. I got charged $1400 for NOTHING!!! They can't even tell me what the charge was for! Not to mention the 14 charges for $0 on my account. It was so bad the bank locked my account!Nothing at all was booked. They keep telling me it's only pending and will disappear from my account within 5 days! The bank is fully aware and watching. Expedia has lied to me and the bank repeatedly. All they had to do to fix it was to send one FAX to the bank, which they promised me they did, three times, with three different reps. Tomorrow, my bank is going to dispute the charge if it hasn't been removed. Meanwhile, the vacation I had planned is most likely being booked solid and I won't be able to reschedule it. Hubby saved for over a year for a vacation and I am fit to be tied! I wish those idiots had a local office I could visit. I'd go over there and bang some heads together. I've never used them before, but they are supposed to be the top travel agency online. Even the bank says they were usually reputable. The reps can barely speak English and refuse to let me speak to a supervisor! BEWARE SCAM!NEVER AGAIN!        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

1042	            My wife and I recently traveled to Italy and bought travel protection plan at a cost of $159. While there, we had a death in the family and needed to return immediately. Called the number on the protection plan after purchasing an international phone to talk to Expedia and the doctors. Called Expedia 4 times, and each time was put on hold and then the call dropped, eating up 60 of our precious 90 minutes on the newly purchased phone. On the 5th try, they finally claimed that the return flight in our package was virtually worthless and that the airline would charge $300 per person to change flights so we were better off just buying another flight. I explained to them that a one-way return flight on our currently booked flight was $2700 each while the new one-way flight was $988 so how could that be. They apologized but said there was nothing they could do. Never once did a single customer service representative ever acknowledge the loss we had suffered or the frustration with their service. After more than 15 years of only using Expedia for all our travels, I will never use them again for the way they treated us and their deceptive advertising. Its clear to me now that travel insurance is an oxymoron and Expedia does not care about its customers. Go elsewhere - there are plenty of options!        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

1044	            I booked my trip to Paris for my 5 year anniversary 8 months before the actual vacation start date.  My husband and I were looking forward to this trip because it was going to be our first time out of the country together in addition to the fact that we would be celebrating our 5 year anniversary in Paris.  We head to the airport only to be told that the tickets we bought had the wrong departure.  We thought we were flying out of San Jose, California but the e-ticket said it was from San Jose, Costa Rica.  It would've been an easy mistake to catch had Expedia written out San Jose, Costa Rica in my e-ticket.  Instead they abbreviated and said SJO San Jose.  How am I supposed to know that SJO stands for San Jose Costa Rica?  It would've been nice if on the e-ticket they said San Jose, Costa Rica or San Jose, California.  If I had known that my ticket information was wrong, I would've corrected it immediately after purchasing.  I had to find out the hard way that what I purchased was wrong.  I was freaking at the airport for goodness sake ready to take off to celebrate our 5 year anniversary only to be told that to make our trip work, we would have to pay an additional $4000 on top of the $3300 I already paid.  Customer service was also horrible.  The person helping me was giving me the run around and said they couldn't do anything to help me out.  My trip is non-refundable.  First of all, the emails given to me with my itinerary did not give a slight indication that my trip was flying out from San Jose, Costa Rica.  The little trace of evidence was the abbreviation SJO, which only experienced travelers would know.  But my husband and I rarely fly out to be able to know this.  There was nothing Expedia could do.  Even Hotwire doesn't do this.  Since I'm a loyal customer through them, they allow me to cancel car reservations or change the date on them.  But Expedia refuses to provide such a service, and will probably not get my business back because of how they treat their paying customers.  No loyalty, but just crumb snatchers.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive
1045	            I booked a recent trip in May via Expedia, their website showed 2 suitcases as my luggage allowance. When I got to the Airport, the airline forced me to pay for the second suitcase and was adamant that the allowance was only one case. The trip was made under Itinerary Number: 1133964002996. I reached out to Expedia three times via their online support desk and called their hotline, after a long wait that exceeded 90 Mins, I was forced to hang up. Their supervisor called back and left a message to simply call again and wait to talk to her instead of taking action to fix my issue.        	                6	1	Thursday	expedia	neutral
1046	"            If I could give 0 stars I would.... On 14th May I called to change only the DEPARTURE flight of a roundtrip, after holding for 1 hour the agent was laughing, singing and talking with other agents during our call. We said 3 times that we only want to change the DEPARTURE flight. We got a confirmation email saying the departure flight has been moved. On 1st June we discovered the return flight had been CANCELLED. I contacted Expedia to reinstate our ticket, I waited for 1.5 hours and the agent linked me to a ""supervisor"" who had NO authority. She contacted Corporate Office and said ""You will be contacted within 5 to 10 business days after they listen to the recording and determine whether to reinstate the tickets or not"" I was not allowed to speak before which she said ""Don't worry they will contact you"". In this situation, Expedia is COMPLETELY at fault and this PROCESS is entirely in-transparent because I have no say in this ""DECISION"". WAITING FOR 10 WORKING DAYS meant the ticket prices will go up in that time and if Expedia does not reinstate our tickets then we need to book highly expensive new return tickets. EXPEDIA SHOULD OWN UP to its MISTAKE and FREEZE the TICKET PRICES on 1st June because it is EXPEDIA'S ""PROCESS"" and NOT MY PROBLEM if their agent's can't do their jobs. I called the customer care number the next day waited again for 3 hours to be put in touch with Manager Micki Rebd in the Corportate Office. She said my case is number 5 and I will get a call the next day morning. I enquired about cancelling she read the policy and said I could cancel the flight to receive $1800 refund not the $2600 that I had spent so far. I DIDN'T GET ANY CALL so the next day I called to enquire and waited for 1.5 hours on a ""special priority line"" where NO-ONE answered. I called in the evening, the ""supervisor"" took my card details to reinstate the flight by charging new flights and reimbursing it immediately. He transferred me to Corportate Office and the manager said ""OUR PROCESS IS that this will be resolved within 72 hours and YOU CANNOT CANCEL THE FLIGHT TO RECEIVE $1800 REFUND BECAUSE THIS IS OUR ""PROCESS"". I think Expedia's customer service is abysmal and I STRONGLY discourage everyone from using it because they add NO VALUE to my experience. My issue is NOT resolved and I want Expedia's Managers in particular to be held accountable for the loss of time, effort and money that we have had to put on their stupid staff and in particular on incompetent MANAGERS, ""SUPERVISORS"" and their ""PROCESS"".

1047	            I called to cancel a package deal with Expedia I was within the 24-hour cancellation policy. For some reason the lady only cancelled the hotel and left the airline tickets. I went ahead and rebooked the trip and of course I got charged for two plane tickets for three people. When I called them they made me wait 2 hours for the supervisor and then they told me that I probably left the tickets because I wanted to stay with a relative (of course the other reservation was booked with them which included hotel plus airline). Finally, they told me they had to review the conversation which would take 7-10 business days. They called me the next day and left a message and said you agreed only to the hotel sorry. When I asked for the recording of me saying please only cancel the Hotel and nothing else they refused to give it to me and sent me to the legal department (no phone) only an address and one lady actually told me the tape had been erased.  SHADY!!!!!! and by the way their call center is not even in the US who knows why they are handling issues from the US on the other side of the world, that is probably why it takes 2 hours to get ahold of a supervisor.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	neutral

1050	            Booked several tickets through Expedia. I was sent an email from one of the airlines that the one of the flight segments was cancelled and for me to contact the travel agency (which is Expedia) to make necessary changes to the flight segments. I called Expedia and spent almost 5 hours on the phone and the issue has not been resolved till now.I was put on extremely long holds with Expedia customer service. Even when an agent was to respond, they would put me on hold for an extended period of time and get back to me only to put me on hold for another extended time. When i finally was fed up with the extended holds and what is apparently inefficient and untrained customer service agents, i asked to speak with a supervisor. That made the whole situation even worse!I was on hold for more than an hour the first time i asked to speak with a supervisor. After waiting for more than an hour, the line hung up (coincedence?!!). I called again and when i was finally able to speak with an agent, i immediately told them i want to speak with a supervisor but before transferring me for this extended wait, i asked the agent for his name and employee ID details. The agent was only able to give me his first name (Mike) and refused to give any further details. He did tell me flat out that they were extremely busy and that I will be on hold for an extended period of time. I asked him to take my number and get the supervisor to call me directly when he or she is available. He flat out told me that they do not provide this service and that i needed to wait on the line!Obviously the above is beyond ridiculous, so i asked for the customer support email address so i can handle this by email instead of wasting hours on the phone. I explained that i cannot find their email address on their website for some reason. The agent (Mike) told me that he cannot provide me with the email address since they have recently updated the system and that he has no access to the email address!!!!!!!!!        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
1051	            Expedia.com has an unacceptable customer service. Their flights might be cheap sometimes - not always (make sure to check other companies)- but be sure to read ALL the fine prints before booking (these instructions are never revealed again). In addition, talking to their customer agents is like talking to robots - no ability to help whatsoever. I am done. K.        	                2	1	Saturday	expedia	positive
1052	            What a freaking nightmare it is to get your seats confirmed through these Expedia bookings. My flight was half Emirates and half Air Canada.

1053	            In 2015 I booked a flight from Los Angeles to Montreal with Expedia.  I cancelled because I found cheaper flights through another company.  I was given a credit and told that I needed to use it prior to a year of the booking and it would cost $200 per traveler, total $400, when I rebooked.  I paid $1,177.62 but actual credit really was $777.62.  I called on 6/1/16 to rebook a flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo and was told that the rebooking price was $800 as the original booking for departure and return were each paid separately.  Let that sink in.  When I booked with Expedia they charged departure and return as separate bookings, which according to their policy, allows them to charge $200 per traveler for departure and return.  I have never paid separately for a roundtrip fare so I never would have known to tell them to make it a single charge.  So, instead of a $777.62 credit, it was $377.62.  Expedia operates fraudulently and needs to be stopped.  I read a lot of the complaints on this website and their standard operating practice appears to be screw the customer at every level.  I would love to get my hands on their training manual and scripts. My husband is an attorney that handles class action lawsuits at a federal level.

1054	            So to be clear with everyone: I called Expedia on March 9th to cancel a trip to Puerto Rico. which was 9 days off. I waited 1 hour to get to speak with a service rep. who then put me on hold for an hour to get a hold of a supervisor, who then took an hour to cancel my trip for my 2 hotel rooms and flight.  I asked that they retrieve the service voice recording to show that the Sale Rep stated no less than three times that the trip could be cancelled with 7 days notice. and to have this escalate to an officer of the company to call me back. They stated they would have someone get back to me immediately and the recording would take 5-10 days to pull and they would follow-up with me. They did nether. Now things go further downhill  I get my AMX bill and they only cancelled one of the rooms on March 9th.  I am now considered a no show at the hotel. It gets worse. They never canceled the flight and now Jet Blue considers me a no show. In the service notes read by the service rep is documented to cancel the whole reservation. How do only then cancel part of the trip??  Who would you say is at fault here. What would most companies do in this situation. They would reimburse me(you) for the cancellation and take ownership of their mistake. Expedia's response it to say I did not show up for the Hotel and Flight and I am responsible - of course I did not show up because I cancelled the trip. What do they do next? They ask me to stay on the phone to call the airline and hotel to ask on my behalf if they will reimburse me. Have you ever heard of a company calling one of their vendors to ask for them to reimburse the costumer for their mistake and blame the costumer for their issue.  I went through the same absurd discussion with their corporate service department with similar wait times. Can anyone help me here or tell me how to turn on the comment sense light for the Expedia service department.        	                2	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
1055	            Expedia made a duplicate/triplicate booking for our family holiday to Sri Lanka charging us over £2600 twice and putting a further pre-authorisation on our account for another £2000 - amounting to £7200 for a £2,600 holiday. Some 15 telephone calls later and over 16 hours of calls over a three week period we still do not have the full refund. Every time we call, we have to repeat the information regarding the duplicate booking only to be told that it is our fault (its not, they made the booking over the telephone for us), that the money has not been taken (it has and I had to produce my bank statements to prove it), and that it will take up to 12 weeks to refund the air tickets and 3 days to refund the hotel. We are continually lied to about refunds having been authorised only to find that they have not been. We have now been refunded for the hotel (over two weeks late) although to add insult to injury they decided not to refund it in total, keeping £15, I can only assume for costs purposes. This, despite it being their fault. The airline tickets remain outstanding and we should expect them to take up to 12 weeks to refund the remainder of the money to our account. This is money that they have taken and which will not be returned to us for up to 3 months leaving us struggling to pay our monthly bills. Be very, very careful of booking with this company. If you have an alternative way of booking that costs you a few extra pounds, do it. I estimate that this problem has cost my husband and I over £500 in lost working hours dealing with it, and in ancillary expenses like phone calls and securing alternative finances whilst we wait for the refund...and it is still ongoing.        	                2	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

1058	            So back in October of 2015 we booked 4 nights in Amsterdam with Expedia. Paid for it and thought all was good. Got to Amsterdam on May 7, 2016, after 9 hours on a plain and was told our reservation was for 2017 by the desk clerk. The Hotel did not have a room that would take 4 people and would not have one till the next day. They did have a room for two people and charged us for putting two cots in it so it would sleep four. The manager of the hotel told us that he would only charge us $60 for the difference as he would honor the reservation. Well that didn't happen. Expedia stated that it was not their problem. The hotel did end up taking the money from the booking but they charged up $570 for one night in the too small room. When you book a room with Expedia, which I would not recommend their program pushes the date ahead. They said that we were the ones that changed the date. I got on a computer and started to make a reservation to see what would happen and it pushed the date ahead by a year. I will never us their services again. They gave us numbers to call back that did not work and ended up having to call a North American number to be told it was not their problem. So they did nothing for us but take our money.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive
1059	"            Not to use them.  I booked 3 legs for Aegean Air for a triangular trip.  Two on Expedia, one on Aegean Air.  Aegean sent me a proper receipt with the fare class (Flex) and when I went to the airport I had indeed one bag max 23k included.  The two legs booked on Expedia showed no fare class, and I was charged by Aegean 45 euros for luggage one leg. I spent 3 hrs over 3 days of vacation trying to get the right information from Expedia for the final leg.  They kept bouncing me around, and even said once I had one luggage for 23k included and would send a receipt.  The next day the email only points me to the baggage policies.  After a few international calls, always taking 20-30 min as they ""look"" for the reservation, without giving you any id # for keeping a record of the call (other than a meaningless first name, ""Alison"" in the last call), they pushed me to Aegean, who claimed the fare was only GoLight.  Yet I had booked all three legs within the same hour back in Feb and knew I'd pay more for luggage if I didn't book it in advance.  Why would I pay for the one leg and not the other two?  It is impossible now to see what the $109 fare equated to way back when.  I had to go online quickly to Aegean and pay 30 euros to prepay the luggage.  Expedia screwed me yet again.  NEVER will I use them, and you'd be a fool to use them yourselves.        "	                7	1	Monday	expedia	negative

I have never had a problem doing this with other sites in the past so I figured it wouldn't be an issue with expedia.  We were scheduled to arrive on Saturday at 4pm... so our plan was to lay by the pool all evening before our 3 days in the park.  The hotel I booked as a mystery guaranteed a pool, free parking, free breakfast, and free shuttle.  Nothing else I really cared about so I was ok with that.  Well.  We got to our hotel, the Days Inn at Disneyland Park.... (looked nice enough from pics I wasn't worried)  To find out that the pool is torn apart for renovation.  The floors were dirty and hadn't been mopped, and there was toothpaste on the sink and I don't even want to know what the brown stuff was on the bathroom door and shower.... I didn't expect a fancy place for the price I paid but regardless of stars you should never have to clean your own hotel room before you even use it.  When contacting expedia to get a refund/or moved to a new hotel as our contract guarantees because of the promised amenities... we went on hold on 2 separate cell phones for 5 hours... arguing and getting tossed between very unprofessional and uneducated people in the Philippines...  the guy my now is fiancé was on the phone with was rude, refused for 2 hours to let us talk to a supervisor, would not give more than his first american name, and argued and got angry.  My fiancé argued with him for 5 hours.  He told us he could get us into another hotel and that we were okay to check out where we were at, but my smart fiancé called the other hotel to confirm before we left and they said they had no idea who we were or what room reservation we were referring to.  If we had taken his word and left we would have been stranded with no where to go.  I had no better luck.  I spoke with 4 different people all full of excuses.  When finally getting to a supervisor I think... they then told me their systems were down and couldn't be fixed.  So we went to dinner frustrated and starving at 1030 at night on our first day of vacation after spending hours on a plane, with no food.  Clearly no relaxing by the pool was to be had.  There was NO resolution.  Did I mention we had a 2 year old with us????  The next day my persistent fiancé called repeatedly during our day in disneyland (yes... wonderful to have to deal with them in the happiest place on earth).  Somehow after another 2 hours on hold he got through to someone that seemed to speak better english and understood the problem and they were able to move us to a new hotel.  It did not have all the amenities we were guaranteed but it was better than where we were so we took it.  Supposably expedia will be sending us reimbursement for the parking we had to pay for at the new place... good luck with that.  Either way.  Who wants to spend 2 hours on hold in Disneyland?   It should have never had to happen.  We then had to leave the parks, go pack our stuff, move to a new place, settle in, then go all the way back to the parks and try to make the most of the expensive park tickets we paid for.  The only upside to the whole day was that I got proposed to that night during the fireworks.  0 stars and I will never ever ever book with you again.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive
1063	            There non-refundable hotel bookings policies  are close to criminal.   Make a mistake, and pay full price.  No recourse, they even challenged my denial of payment with the credit card company, with lies, that I never challenges the charges.

1064	            I had an absolutely horrible experience with Expedia and I do not plan to ever book through them again. I made my initial Washington, D.C. flight/hotel booking online.  About a week later I decided to change hotels. I had put in hours of research (literally) to make sure I picked the perfect hotel for my trip. I called and talked to someone but was disconnected right before they could book the new hotel. When I called back I talked to a different person. During this call I could hear children playing in the background. People were singing and clapping. It sounded like there was a party going on in the background. This made me a little uncomfortable when I had to read off my credit card information because it did not sound very legitimate. Due to the second person not being able to find the hotel I was referencing, I was on the phone for over an hour.I received a confirmation email that specifically said I did not need to contact the hotel or Expedia to confirm my reservation. The day before my trip I called the hotel to ask about an early check-in. They did not have a reservation for me in their system. I called Expedia and they verified that somehow, the reservation did not go through to the hotel. They also told me the hotel was now completely booked up. I was very upset because, like I said, I had put hours of research into picking what I thought would be the perfect hotel for our trip. This is why I had changed it in the first place. I spent over two hours on the phone while they tried to find me a new hotel with the same amenities. The hotel the rep finally decided on did not have nearly as good of reviews as the one I had picked. I voiced my concern about this but he assured me the hotel would be even better than the other. Before booking, the representative also assured me it had a shuttle to/from the airport. Once I finished my call with Expedia I called the hotel to verify the information. I was told the hotel does not offer a shuttle to the airport. This caused me to spend another 40 minutes on the phone waiting on hold for and talking to a supervisor. She reimbursed me $50 so I could use a cab. This seemed fine until we got to the hotel. Part of the reason I wanted the hotel I had booked was because the shuttle to/from the metro station (and airport) ran from 6am-12:30am every day of the week. The hotel we had to stay in had a shuttle to/from the metro from 9am-9pm (but it did not run between 2-4:30pm) Monday-Friday. It did not run on weekends at all. This was very inconvenient and caused us to use a cab many, many more times than we had expected. The hotel itself was not very clean and was very outdated.  I was not pleased with the hotel at all. I am so thankful I called the hotel the day before the trip. I cannot imagine having to deal with all of this after landing in DC. We would have lost an entire day trying to find a new hotel. I spent almost 3 hours on the phone the day before my trip. This took way too much time out of my schedule seeing as I was preparing to leave for five days. This experience was absolutely horrible and I will never book with Expedia again. I plan to put as many reviews about this experience on as many websites as possible to warn others.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive
1065	            My friend and I booked two international flights from US to China recently through Expedia, and Air Canada was intended to take us to Toronto and Vancouver as two transit cities before bring us to China. However, we were never informed by Expedia that we actually have to apply for a transit visa to enter two Canadian airports (if we only enter one airport, we don't need a visa, tho). As a result, we stayed in our departure airport for two hours, only to find we were not allowed to check in. When we called Expedia customer service, the guy told us it was not their responsibility to take our nationality or visa as consideration for booking, we can only get our $1400 flight tickets into flight credits with additional fine of $500 and other strict policies if we want to use them!! How funny it was!!! So we missed the flight and my brother's wedding. We were not able to apply for a transit visa in time or use those credits to book another flight with Air Canada (their recent flights all require a transit visa for Chinese). Eventually, we have to book another flight with different airlines, and so far we have spent more than $3500 on this trip. Compared to other agencies, Expedia sucks as well!!!! My pals are all using Student Universe to book flights, and it does provide details instructions for customers in advance, including visa advice, if they need to enter Canadian airport as a transit place. I used to be a loyal customer, and have been using Expedia for two years, but I will never use Expedia again. Never!!!        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	positive
1066	"            Terrible experience with Expedia.ca on our return flight #3 of 3 from Montreal to Vancouver (en route from Europe). A few weeks prior to our trip, Expedia had sent us an ""updated itinerary with a flight change"". Today we arrived in Montreal from a long transatlantic flight to check in to our last flight to Vancouver and Air Canada informed us that Expedia never submitted the flight change to their system, our names were not on the flight list and therefore we didn't have a spot on the flight because it was full. We spent over an hour on the phone with Expedia who provided us with a false boarding pass reservation number assuring us that we would get on the flight - it was a standby reservation # and we didn't get on the flight. We then called again to inform the agent that we didn't get on our flight. The Expedia agent informed us (after lengthy hold periods) that all the flights today were full and the best they could do was get us on a flight tomorrow at no extra charge. They said this was a routine and normal occurrence and no compensation for meals or hotel would be issued. This completely messed up our work schedule and family schedule for tomorrow. When I asked again, what about hotel accommodation or meals as we would be spending an additional 13+ unplanned hours overnight in Montreal? The agent told me ""I don't know"". I said, ""but it's Expedia's fault"". He said: it's not our problem, it's the airlines problem.Bottom line: beware of booking mishaps and absolutely terrible customer service from Expedia. This is the last time we use Expedia for our travel needs.On a more positive note, kudos to the Air Canada staff at the Montreal airport. When they realized what had happened, they stepped in and gave us a hotel voucher and meal voucher. We appreciate their kindness and going the extra mile for their customers.

1067	            I write positive and negative reviews. The experience I had with Expedia's customer service has been THE worst I've ever dealt with. It's taken nearly a week to get refunded money for a trip cancellation due to a death in the family. First the rep said I was charged a 500 cancellation fee. Took about two days to clear that up since I definitely had trip protection and canceled before the flight even took off. I don't know who they're outsourcing too but they need to revamp the personnel to fully understand travel insurance and customer needs.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	neutral
1068	            made flight reservations, tried to cancel, expedia customer service said systems down, call back in 2 hours.  called back, they said call back 2 hours.  i can work with some of the language barriers but poor customer service is poor customer service, had automobile booked as well.  they refused to help in dealing with auto company in canada.  finally asked to talk to the car rental.  told the guy my flight, comes in 2-3 hours after the time that was arbitrarily assigned by their website, the manager says i can't do anything, then relents and agrees to make changes, after he understands the reservation time period makes no sense.  expedia operator refused to hold the line.  so called back, asked for supervisor placed on hold for 40 minutes, called with different phone, placed on hold as well, two calls now going on to 1 hour.  very poor customer service.  finally a supervisor comes on, she doesn't understand what doesnt make sense about a car being booked hours ahead of the arrival of a flight.  tried to explain the situation, she finally understands. however she places me on hold, before i can explain that i spoke to the car rental, and i am calling back to make sure that, expedia didnt cancel my original car rental, and to confirm the agreed upon changes.  make sure to ask the agents his/her name, customer service id, list down the date, time you called, and if possible location.  if they refuse to provide customer id number, don't talk to them, nothing to hold them accountable to.  First agent that didnt give me her agent id, the line is still on hold, waiting for a supervisor, that was 1 hour 10 minutes ago and counting, the second call, when i received the agents name, and id, the supervisor came on the line, still took her 25 minutes.  will opt out of using expedia in the future.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

1070	            I like to book on expedia and do it quite often. However if your trip needs some changes and you try to contact them their customer service will not help you. My hotel recently was overbooked and when i got there I had no room. Called expedia to get a solution. The customer service representative didn't speak good English and decided that i wanted a refund for my entire trip, so she almost canceled my 3 days reservation. Instead of staying w/o a room one day I almost ended up without a room at all. Then when it was 2am and I was still on the line waiting for solution I decided to find a room myself and asked her not to call me back which she ignored and called me 5 more times between 2am and 3am just to let me know she didnt find another room for me. I called the next day to complain and sent them an email... nothing, not even an email to apologize for that terrible experience.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative

1072	            I just had the worst experience with Expedia. They called me to tell me one of my flights was cancelled and that they had to put me on a  different one. The only one they could put me on was a 10 hour layover that would have me spend my first night of my honeymoon in an airport!!!!! I told them that would not work and they said they would work on it. It took them 5 days to call me back and had the same result. I asked to cancel my flights. I was put on hold for more than 45 minutes. When someone did come back to the line it took her another 20 to cancel my flight. I also had the insurance on the flight and wanted to cancel that she tried to cancel but said she couldn't but would give me a $25 credit so I could use it in the future!!!!First off I will never be using expedia again so take your damn credit and second my insurance I paid for was $88 not $25 so that doesn't even cover the cost. I was then told I had to speak to a manager but it would be another 40 minute wait.... this is after I have been on hold for over hour for this call already. After a 20 more minute wait I finally spoke to a manager that refunded my insurance! What a terrible experience.

The customer service representative, whose first language was not English, was happy to process the order in two transactions as that is the only way the system could handle it. Well he typed my email address with one letter wrong. The result was that I did not get a confirmation or the points added to my account. I spent three months, 10+ emails, 2 phone call including holding for 15+ minutes, trying to fix it. I even emailed the CEO. Ended up just where I started. I purchased 17 nights of hotel rooms for almost $4,000 and they did not care enough fix the fact that they created a duplicate account. They kept saying I needed to email from them account that I do not have. That yes my name is the same and the email is one letter different, but that I am not allowed to have two account. To which I said GREAT, fix it! Oh, well we maybe an online company but we don’t know how to combine the data from two account. F-Off Expedia!        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive
1076	"            On our honeymoon, back in September, we booked a $932 flight through Expedia to get from Corfu to Paris with a layover in Prague. Then the plan was to get my dress and our wedding luggage in Paris and then catch our flight from CDG to SFO home! When we checked our luggage in Corfu, we were told our luggage was booked straight through to CDG. We arrived in Prague and had a 6+ hour layover, so we wandered around the airport a bit and happened to stumble across our luggage in a far corner of the baggage claim. We gathered it up and went to speak with someone, who told us ""sometimes that happens"", but that we couldn't re-check it until the kiosk opened. We went to the kiosk at 6AM as soon as it opened to re-check the luggage for our flight to Paris, but we were told by Czech Air that ""there's no ticket for us"". I showed her my Expedia printed ticket, which said clearly on it that ""this was an e-ticket that could be used for boarding"". In fact, the only reason we went to the check-in kiosk at all was to re-check our luggage which was supposed to have gone straight to Paris in the first place; otherwise we would have tried to get on the plane with those tickets we had! We were told firmly that Expedia had made a mistake and that there was no ticket issued for us on their side, and that we should never have even been allowed to get on the plane to Prague because there wasn't a ticket for that either, and they didn't know how we got on that first leg.I stood at the kiosk and tried to explain to the lady that we needed to get on that plane because we were picking up my wedding dress via courier at CDG and then catching our transcontinental flight back to SFO. Meanwhile Kevin stepped aside to call Expedia using the only possible option: our cell phones. We had already lined up the maximum international roaming plan through AT&amp;T, but calls are still $1/min. and Expedia kept us on hold for literally hours that morning, blaming Czech Air for the problem and saying they had nothing to do with it. Expedia said there was nothing they could do for us and that our $932 flight tickets were simply lost somewhere in the communication, but that they wouldn't do anything about it. So I called. I got someone else who said that they would try to get to the bottom of it. We heard nothing back. Obviously we missed that flight, and our intercontinental flight home as well.Evening came, and we had to get a hotel. We had to take an Uber to the hotel, at which point we had no idea what to do. My sister got on Twitter to say that we were stranded in Prague and couldn't get ahold of anyone to help. We immediately got a call from ""Addison Anderson"" in the Tier 3 department, who stated that she was going to help us, that she'd get us home, that let's not worry about itemizing the consequential damages at this time but that she would take care of that after we were safely home. She outlined a flight that would leave the next morning at 11AM through Lufthansa. We said YES YES YES get us on that flight, and she said she would call us back when it was confirmed. Evening turned into night and we had not heard back.The next morning, I woke up early and packed up everything. We took another Uber, got to the airport and called Expedia again because we hadn't heard from them or gotten any email with our tickets for the Lufthansa flight, so we needed to get our tickets from them to get through security to catch our flight. After again being put on hold, we spoke to an extremely caustic male individual who stated that there was ""no way"" that Expedia would ever give us a return flight home and literally said that he did not believe me and accused me of making up the entire story. He said he had no record of any phone call with anyone in Tier 3 and that there was absolutely no flight booked for us out of Prague. We tried to get ahold of someone else to no avail, and eventually watched our second flight change from ""on time"" to ""boarding"" to ""closed"" to ""departed"" on the ticker.We went to McDonald's to cry over some fries. Finally, my cell phone got a call. I spoke with a woman whose name I don't remember who told us she'd get us home on a different flight. I explained that my dress and wedding luggage was now stranded in Paris and to please check if we could layover through CDG so we could pick it up. There were no flights through CDG in their price range that they were authorized to cover, she said, so we ended up with a flight through LHR with a 10+ hour layover and a second layover in Chicago. We said OK, just get us home. I tried to get confirmation that she would be covering the consequential damages because of the missed flight from the day before, and she said she could not promise anything that wasn't already promised by Addison Anderson yesterday.We took the flight, and had to get another hotel for our 10+ hour layover in London. We went through Chicago. We eventually got home. Months later, we had to have personal friends take taxis to pick up our stranded items in Paris from where they had been stored for a few months and then check them in their luggage back with them to Seattle. Then it had to get shipped back down to us in San Francisco.We submitted all our records to Expedia for reimbursement as soon as we got home. This included the two nights in hotels, the Ubers to get to the hotels and back to the airport, the minutes used on international calling to get ahold of someone to help us, the storage for my dress and luggage, and reimbursement for my friends' expenses in recouping my items in Paris and the shipment from Seattle to us in San Francisco. Expedia says that they will not cover anything besides the first item. Not the Ubers, not the storage for the dress or luggage, not our friends' fees to pick up our stuff or check it back, or to ship it back to us. Not our hundreds and hundreds of dollars of AT&amp;T fees to get ahold of someone to get us out of Prague. Why? They said that ""their records show that they specifically booked us through London so we could pick up the dress"". As you all know or can see from my profile picture, our wedding was in PARIS, not in LONDON. The London layover was chosen because (a) they never booked us on the promised Lufthansa flight, and (b) it was the only one left that they'd pay for.I tried to explain their misunderstanding back in November. They have refused to respond to my messages since. That last communication was in November - six months ago. Expedia has completely stopped answering my calls or emails to Addison or anyone else in Tier 3. They have never reimbursed us for even the hotels that they did say they'd cover. They say that if we had wanted reimbursement we should have gotten it authorized before we accepted the flight in Prague (this statement comes after Addison told me specifically that we should worry about just getting home and they'd pay for everything after we were back). They have just gone completely radio silent in the hopes we'd go away. I've even offered to take some of the compensation in Expedia points if that was easier for them to get authorized. But nothing. I'm fed up, and I thought all of you should be aware of how they treat people.        "	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive
1077	"            We booked a car rental with our Visa travellers points that must be used through Expedia, it was an add on to our flights. Our points were taking and the car rental should have been completely covered. Our rental from the ""Miami airport"" was with Economy rental cars, and was in fact ""off site"". After wandering the airport aimlessly and passing the thirty name brand car rental companies, we called to discover we would be shuttled off site to pick up the car. Upon arrival at a shady, scary location, we had to wait 2 hours for the car to be ""cleaned"". We sat and watched the terrible service and every customer walking in the door being told they had to pay more, had to take their insurance, it was their policy, or in our situation and one other lady, we had to pay AGAIN! Every customer was argued with, by the ignorant staff. We are a family with young children, and four suitcases that have now been trapped in a scary desolate location. We paid $400 US, for a vehicle with no GPS. That was an additional $9 a day, which they charged us 4 days on a 3 day rental. What a huge fail for Expedia. This entire ordeal is fraudulent.  I will challenge and demand that Visa (that my travellers points are with) to reverse payments to them.

At one point they told us they had called the resort and arranged it through them to give us the $75 per person, per day deal.  Since we are going in 3 days, I wanted to confirm that Expedia arranged that with the resort...they hadn't!  The AI   charge through the resort was going to be twice that amount.  I think the agent we talked to just said he'd arranged it with the resort to get rid of us!  There was no record with Expedia of our call that day either.

Finally they admitted that the ticket agent screwed up but told me that the flight is sold out and there are no seats.

I called back and after another hour they told me they are closed and call back tomorrow. Well it's tomorrow and here I sit on hold.  This is a nightmare and completely unacceptable.  I will never deal with this company again. I always dealt with Orbitz before and never had a problem. I thought I'd give expedia a try.

1086	            A simple trip turned into hours of frustration.  The website is terrible and the customer service is even worse.  You can have the trip you want, as long as it is what they want you to have.  I called customer service to add a rental car and spent 20 minutes listening to up selling. When I asked for another customer service rep he told I would have to call back.  I asked for a supervisor and he hung up.  Since Expedia bought Travelosity and Orbitz it has only gotten worse.  Do yourself a favor and go to you local travel agent.  This company will only waste your time.        	                3	1	Monday	expedia	negative
1087	"            I have to travel frequently for my job. In fact, because my company's travel agency charges a premium, my boss suggested to me that I book my tickets via Expedia to save time/money.Instead of saving time and money, I have gained stress, frustration and countless headaches dealing with them. While their website is adequate as a directory, I always thought it should be easier to work with a human being. Long story short, I don't know where they hire their people, but their personnel department should be fired and replaced for doing such a bad job in terms of picking people to staff their phones.Let's take a moment to look at their broken process. Instead of looking at flights, they ask you to book your hotel first. That should be easy enough, but I had to tell them ten times which hotel I wanted and had to reiterate to them that I wanted a non-smoking room with a king sized bed. Something tells me that they forgot that ""little"" detail. If that wasn't bad enough, then came the most important part - booking the tickets.Since I went to their site previously, I knew exactly which flight(s) I wanted and simply wanted them to order the tickets for me. You'd think that would be easy -- if anything, it made me want to take the phone and throw it out the window. The representative argued with me saying that flight did not exist. I kept saying that it did and she said she couldn't find it. I got to the point where I said that if I book this ticket online, I will contact her supervisor and have her fired. I guess being scared that she would lose her job finally woke her up when she told me I should log into my account. I fail to understand why I would need to do that if I was going to work with her, but I humored her, logged in and went through the steps of booking the hotel, flight, etc. It was at that point she *FINALLY* saw the flight, but even then by the time it came for me to confirm the price, the price had already changed. In other words, the price changed within less than 5 minutes after I entered it into the system. The representative didn't have a good answer for me. It was at that point I demanded to speak with her supervisor. Fortunately it was a short wait and I explained the situation. The supervisor was unable to help me saying that it was ""too late"" to get the lower price and that the only way she could get it for me was to book the higher price (in other words, accept being ripped off) or have them escalate to their helpdesk to get that lower price. I came up with a third option - combining the two - they charge me the higher price, but then work in the background to credit me the lower price AND give me a reserved seat (something that i still find hard to believe that I have to pay extra to do). She then put me on hold, only to then push me to a new customer service rep that had absolutely no idea what was going on. I asked to speak to a supervisor to complete the transaction and then was put on hold for 30 minutes. Out of frustration, I hung up and called back, forcing me to speak to a fourth representative. It was at that point the price DROPPED to even lower than what I was originally quoted. I asked the representative to book that for me and after some hand wringing she was able to get me that price.One thing is for sure - if I have to book a trip ever again, I will NEVER use these clowns again and suggest none of you do either - they may have been good at one point in time, but clearly they lost the recipe somewhere along the way.AVOID AVOID AVOID.

1088	"            Expedia charged me over $50 for a so-called ""Travel Protection Plan"".  But when I had to cancel my flight due to unforeseen circumstances, I was told that I couldn't get a refund unless there is a death in the family or there's a medical condition for which there has to be a note from a doctor to show that the traveler is unable to travel.  So, prospective travelers, unless you do expect a death in your family or some serious medical conditions during your planned travel, don't spend a penny on that useless ""travel protection plan"", and better yet, don't use Expedia for your travel needs.  Instead, contact the airlines, rental car companies, and hotels directly.  With those merchants, you tend to have greater flexibility.        "	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative

It seemed straight forward: enter dates, airport, arrival time and Bob's your uncle.  Nope, nope, nope.It took three hours to straighten it out and it was ONLY possible because I got the name of the company (it doesn't appear anywhere on the Expedia website) and spoke to a wonderful woman who fixed everything. She had taken a call from the rep I was talking to and said she finally just hung up in frustration because of language difficulties.  Here's the bottom line: book directly with the airline, the resort, whatever---that way you're dealing with the folks that are invested in helping you. Maybe you'll spend more, but read the horrible reviews from people who have lost money, time and entire holidays and ask yourself if it's worth it!        	                4	1	Saturday	expedia	neutral

1094	            I booked online a hotel that had two pools for the kids. Got to the hotel there were probably over 50 people partying all over the hotel. Got to my room it was so dirty we could not take our shoes off! Heaters were broken off the walls! Insulation was stuffed in the holes were the broken heaters were. So I went to the hotel front desk they tell me they can not do anything as I booked through Expedia! Now at this time its 8pm I just drove with kids for the past 5 hrs! We just want to go to the pool at this point but can not because of the room issue! I call Expedia and after telling my issue I get put on hold for 20 min the another agent gets on the phone and I then tell what is happening again!I then get put on hold again! Another person gets on the phone again! I then have to tell my story again! The agent argues that I should agree to drive back the way I came another 30 min to get a hotel with a pool because this town has no more room for the price they can match for! I explain I paid 40 dollars for the park pass to stay in this town and that we just want to get a room where we can actually take our shoes off! As well we have kids! So why is this such a party hotel! Now its been 1 hour and 30 min and I request a manager! I then get delayed! Then the manager says okay I got a hotel with a pool! So I say book it please as during this whole time we have been sitting in our truck! Waiting to get a room! I then get told the original hotel we booked was cancelled so I am now obligated to go to the new hotel with a pool. No big deal! I confirm I was not charged for the first hotel booking! He assured me there is no charge! I get to the new hotel the supervisor who I have been on the phone with now tells me we are good and he will go. I ask once again that everything was taken care of and he once again assures me it is all good. I get too new hotel noe 945pm so no swimming for the kids because its bed time! I check in ! And ask where is the pool for the morning? They explain we are sorry there is no pool! Now I am so broken about this trip! I say okay lets just go to bed and we need food and sleep. I order food from my room down at the restaurant! Go to pay and my credit card is frozen! I call get told because of the two hotel fees the credit card company put my card on hold! So yes now we have lost our first night on our vacation! There is no pool for the kids! And to top it all of my only source of money is frozen! This has been the most horrible experiance and I will be seeking legal advice for the misleading ads they have posted on there site for the rooms as well as telling me there was a pool and there actually is not a pool!I am devastated!        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	positive

1097	            I booked a flight for my mother through Expedia from the U.S. to Europe.  A day before the flight I received a message from one of the airlines that the flight has been cancelled due to a strike in Germany.  I called Expedia and after being placed on hold for about 45 minutes the Expedia agent simply hung up. After reaching Expedia again I was informed that all flights are confirmed and still valid.Several hours later I received a call from my family in Europe asking if I have rebooked my mom’s flight since all the Lufthansa flights have been cancelled.  I called Expedia and the agent was completely unaware of the cancelled flights and insisted that the flight would go on.  In a meantime I have reached the airline and the airline confirmed that the flight has been officially cancelled more than a day earlier due to a strike.  Upon my insistence, the Expedia agent went on Lufthansa’s website to confirm the information.  Minutes later I was placed on hold… for another 40 minutes.  The call was disconnected by Expedia while I was on hold. All in all I had to call Expedia five times and the last time I was told that the flight was valid and that my mother should proceed with her travel.  Have I trusted Expedia, my 80-year-old mom would’ve ended up stranded in Frankfurt.Eventually I called the airline directly and the agent immediately informed me that the flight from Frankfurt has been cancelled.  The airline rebooked the flight within minutes.How was it possible that Expedia’s call center and its so-called “customer service” didn’t know about a massive Lufthansa strike that has been prominent in the news already for days? Expedia’s own system was showing flights as valid even a day after they were cancelled by the airline.  Expedia’s gross incompetence and complete lack of customer support makes it perhaps the worst travel booking agency in the world.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1098	"            Myself, my boyfriend and two other friends booked a trip to Mexico through Expedia. It was a nightmare from the start, but losing our trip and $4000 was the biggest nightmare of all.The original date (April 26, 2016) which we booked happened to not work for my boyfriend due to school (which isn't a reasonable reason for the trip insurance we purchased), so we called and asked about canceling and rebooking on another flight ($250 a person). That alone was alot of money, as I work full-time and my boyfriend is a student. I told them that I would have to think about it, little did she tell me that I didn't have long to think about it becuase in a couple days it went from $250 a person to half once it was 45 days before our trip. So when we decided that we were will to spend the $250 each and called back to rebook, they told me I could do so for $900 a person, trying to fly on another air transat flight wasn't a option becuase they only fly a few times a year out of St John's NL. So instead of losing $1800 they said if we booked from another airport and got ourselves there we could switch flights/airports for three days earlier than our original flight for a extra $100 a person. Not including the cost of plane tickets from St. John's to Toronto and back. So we switched our vacation to start out of Toronto and then booked flights with Air Canada the day before to get to Toronto. Unfortunately every flight on Friday April 22nd was canceled due to zero visibility fog. We needed to be in Toronto for 3am to check in for our Air Transat flight. So when it was obvious there was no way for us to get there on time I started calling Expedia. Having to talk through them in order to talk to Air Transat when I was upset this was making the situation more frustrating. The only options that after paying $4000 that I was given was to get our own flight to Mexico, and then come back on the original booking, or pay a extra $244 a person in order to book a one way ticket to get on the Air Transat flight out of Toronto the next morning to the same resort. We did not want to fly on a different airline and then have to get a cab from the airport to the resort in Mexico that doesn't seem safe given travel warnings for Mexico. We also did not have another $500 to lose a day and then possibly not be able to get to Toronto the next day either. They told me that becuase it was 24 hours before our trip it was non refundable so they were doing me a favor even giving me any options. We paid you $4000 for a vacation we weren't getting becuase of weather. The supervisor of Expedia offered me a $200 travel voucher ""out of goodwill"" I would never book through them again. Nor would I fly with Air Transat ever again.Air Canada went out of their way to try and do everything for us becuase our flight was  cancelled. She tried everything to get us to Toronto so we wouldn't miss our flight. She was also mind blown that Air Transat wouldn't put us on the flight on Sunday. Then when there was no flight that would get us for our Air Transat flight she totally refunded the money we had paid for the flights with them.I work hard for my money, but having to save for this trip and booking time off of work made this vacation very important to us. Losing $4000 (not including costs of items for the trip) and not getting a vacation, and having to go back to work on Monday instead of being on a beach in Mexico was definitely not what I paid for.

Two months later, and a  month before is time to go, Expedia emails that American Airlines has cancelled the flight.   What? The internet says the flight is still available.  American Airlines told me ""we have code share responsibilities"" and ""we can not speak to what Expedia does"", inferring that they would not cancel a sold ticket if the plane was still flying.   So....it appears that Expedia overbooked this flight, though they claim that it was American Airlines who cancelled.  Who do you believe?

1102	"            I have yet another example of Expedia's abysmal customer service.On Saturday 2 April I made a booking through Expedia for return flights with Ryanair from London to Malta for my family and I. I received a travel confirmation from Expedia in relation to those flights on the same day. Shortly thereafter, I received an e-mail from Ryanair confirming our return flights from Malta to London. However, I didn't receive any e-mail from Ryanair in respect of our outbound flights. Accordingly later in the day on 2 April I called Expedia to find out whether there was a problem with our outbound flights and was told that it sometimes takes a while for the ticketing to be confirmed and that I should wait for 24 hours before getting back in touch.As I had still not received a confirmation from Ryanair, on Sunday 3 April, I called up Expedia again to speak with a representative. After several frustrating calls, I was told to wait for a further 48 hours to see if Ryanair confirmed our outbound flights and, if no such confirmation had been received, I should make my own booking with Ryanair. When I expressed concern about waiting for this period and the impact that this might have on the price (and availability), I was told that Expedia would compensate me (within 7 days) for any increased cost, as well as the additional credit card booking charges. I had been lead to believe that this process would be straightforward and efficient. I also asked why Expedia couldn't go ahead and action the original booking, but the Expedia representative was unable to provide any sensible explanation.As I had still received nothing from Ryanair by the afternoon of Monday 4 April, I decided to go ahead and make a booking with Ryanair direct. However, given the intervening period of time since my original booking through Expedia, the cost of those flights had increased significantly. Given the increase in cost, I sent an e-mail to Expedia on 4 April, with a copy of the travel confirmation that I received from Ryanair in respect of our outbound flights, requesting compensation on account of the increased cost of our flights (and a refund of the £20 credit card fee that I had been charged at the outset by Expedia that I had not been advised of).Later in the day on 4 April, I received an e-mail from an Expedia representative (called Alam) confirming the reservation of our outbound and return flights. This e-mail dishonestly suggested that our outbound flights had been successfully booked through Expedia as per the original Expedia travel itinerary. This was categorically not the case.On 7 April, I received an e-mail from another Expedia representative (called Dipenti) indicating that the claim in my e-mail of 4 April could not be processed as the e-mail from Ryanair was not considered sufficient proof on account of the fact that it is editable. As explained to Dipenti in response, I had received no other communication from Ryanair in relation to our outbound flights. Accordingly I re-sent this e-mail as an attachment, together with a pdf copy of my credit card statement showing the payment made by me on 4 April direct to Ryanair.Later in the day on 7 April, I received an e-mail from yet another Expedia representative (called Deepti) saying that two attempts had been made to call me to discuss my claim. This was an outright lie (my mobile phone was with me throughout the day)On 10 April I received an encouraging email (from Dipenti) indicating that my refund would be processed within 5-7 days. However, despite several further emails to Expedia asking after the whereabouts of the refund, no refund has been forthcoming. I am presently dealing with, you've guessed it, another Expedia representative - Hemant. I have no hope of getting my compensation any time soon and am therefore considering making a legal claim against Expedia through the small claims court.My opinion is that Expedia do everything they can to frustrate customers' attempts to obtain compensation/refunds. Interestingly, the Expedia representative that I spoke with on 3 April said that the problem that I have experienced occurs in ""only"" one in twenty bookings. Given this terrible statistic, my experience (and those of others) should serve as warning of Expedia's poor service and utter disinterest in customer satisfaction.

I was then placed on hold for 45 minutes. I must add that my mother who was in a wheel chair was also travelling with me. Next, I get an ""supervisor"" that tells me I can get on the 10:40 flight. Firstly, the flight was sold out, secondly, I had no boarding pass to get on the plane, thirdly, by this time, it was 1030 and I had no chance of making the flight if I did have a ticket. Get put on hold for another 45 minutes before they disconnected my call. By this time, my cell phone was dead, so I get on the payphone that is charging me 25 cents per minute. I promptly tell them I want to speak to a manager, I got put on hold for 45 minutes. When I finally get a manager, they have no idea of my previous phone calls, and put me on hold for 45 minutes. When they do get back on the phone, I am told I will have to spend 800+ dollars per ticket (2) to get home. I finally just purchased 2 tickets at 800.00 total from the airline because I had no other choice. I also missed a day of work because the only flight was the next day. So I am finally home, and when I check my email I get an email asking me to review my 10:40 flight out of Las Vegas (this was the flight they cancelled without my consent). Today, I have called Expedia because I did spring for travel insurance, and they tell me they show me flying out of Las Vegas at 3 pm today- I AM HOME!!!! They put me on hold for 45 minutes before we are disconnected. I decided to send them an email because I do not want to be charged for a third flight, and my email is returned as their website is down. I urge everyone to not use Expedia or you will be out 100's of dollars along with time and energy. I am currently in the process of contacting my credit card company to block anymore charges from them. I have also contacted 2 of my local TV stations to see if they can help me. I have documentation from the airline that proves that Expedia cancelled this without my approval, and I plan to fight this with the BBB and Attorney General. I urge everyone to spread the word so that no one else has to go through this!        "	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

1114	            Expedia is probably one of the most unprofessional and misleading companies I have ever worked with. Despite the fact that I paid for travel protection, I paid more in total fees for less expensive flights than my original reservation, even when factoring in the additional cost of travel protection.When I did call to make a change to my travel day (because you cannot do that online), I was told that I had a $200 penalty for each ticketed flight. I had to tell them that I had paid for travel protection, and they only reversed the charges by inquiring with the airline.Finally, even though I called well in advance of to change my first reservation to a different travel day, my first flight wasn’t even cancelled by Expedia. It eventually became a no-show, which Expedia would not take responsibility for. I found out about that three weeks after the date of the first flight, and only after being on the phone with Expedia for over 2 hours.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1115	            the most appalling and unsatisfactory 'customer service' I have ever encountered (and being worse than Talk Talk takes some doing).  The personnel seem to have no idea at all how to resolve queries.I made a combined booking (or thought I had) for a hotel and flight to Jersey for 3 nights.I was comfortable I had provided all details, but realised after a day or so that I had received no confirmation.I signed up to the web site to check my booking and found the itinerary reference for the outgoing flight. When I phoned them to check the details against the itinerary I was told the trip was for Mexico! I carried on the discussion with the representative who then transferred me to a Spanish speaking person (if they really do keep recordings, this took place around 12.30 on Monday 11th April 2016 / so could be checked)!I checked back later to find that they did not recognise my itinerary reference and they disconnected me without further assistance.By this time I had had enough and asked my wife to ring on my behalf.  Verbally they confirmed that both the flight and hotel bookings were confirmed. However, again, no email confirmation was received, so I have been trying to check this out again this evening. Out of a total of approx. 1.5 hours (at 10p per minute) I was purposely disconnected 3 times in the middle of the discussion. I hung on and spoke to another representative who said she would try to help but that she herself was in a queue to get an answer from a colleague. She kept me hanging on for 20 minutes plus after which time I had to give up.Following the aforementioned fiasco, I checked for myself with the Airline (Easy Jet) and found we did indeed have a reservation. I went onto telephone the hotel directly and they also confirmed the booking we had.I don't think it was too much to expect a simple confirmation by email of the package I had booked. This episode has caused completely unnecessary heartache and even if they had the cheapest offer in future  I would do my best to never use them again and would pass that message on to friends and colleagues.With this attitude and approach they deserve no custom at allUnfortunately 'no stars' is not an option        	                2	1	Monday	expedia	neutral
1116	"            I reserved a room with these clowns. It all went smoothly.........that is until I tried to change the date. First I went to ""change date"" on their janky website.  Wouldn't let me no matter how many times I tried. I decided to call customer service and have them sort it out. BIG MISTAKE.  The first csr (customer service representative ) I spoke with had me give her a bunch of info then made me hold for 30 min. After that she transferred me to india, where I had to give this car the same info. She put me off and on hold several times. Had a difficult time understanding her as her accent was very pronounced and the connection was awful. Constant static, fading in and out. Another 30 min passed and suddenly I was transferred  to another lovely Hindu lady. Again, I had to answer all the questions. Was on hold forever. When she got back to me she said,""i spoke with the hotel and the manager will call us in the morning. We will email you, thank you, come again!"" Oh yeah also the last 2 ladies I spoke with were pretty condescending.  Anyway a couple days pass and I just call the hotel myself. Within minutes I had the date changed, no problem. In the following days I received emails stating that the snake charmers at expedia were still working hard to get it changed. So that pretty much tells me they were just jerkin off and eating vindaloo. The day before my stay I called the hotel and confirmed my reservation. All good. Later that night I got an email from from the expedia sweat shop saying they changed my room but I was being charged a penalty by the hotel. There was no penalty. The hotel didn't care but that whole situation must've been hard to grasp while worshiping cows. Next time I just call a hotel myself. Expedia was little to no help; all they really managed to do was stress me out. They're either incompetent or apathetic or both. Expedia sucks.        "	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

I have now tried to cancel that since November 2015 I have sent 24 mails and called but I am apparently still a member according to the monthly statements.  It amazes me that they are so determined to keep a member that clearly wishes to have nothing to do with them. I can only advice others to think very carefully before signing up.

1121	            Yesterday, April 6th, 2016, I called Expedia to change the date on my departing flight (from JFK to LAX) from April 20th to April 21st. I was very specific and repeated several times throughout the call that I did not want to make any changes to my returning flight that was set for April 24th. Unfortunately, expedia's telephone agent made a mistake and as he changed my departing flight he CANCELLED my returning flight. (After I had paid for an upgraded seat in Virgin America, which I now have lost). He was not able to fix the issue so I had to wait for TWO hours on the phone while he communicated to the support team. Then, I got to speak to a supervisor, who very honestly explained the situation and took responsibility for the agent's mistake. He gave me a case number. However, he committed to calling me in two hours (meaning at 11:00 p.m. NY time last night) or writing an e-mail if he couldn't reach me on the phone, which he didn't. I woke up this morning with no solution to the situation. In a nutshell, I waited two hours on the phone (which was very upsetting), I spoke to a supervisor who promised a solution in a two hour time frame and it's the next day and still no solution or no communication from anybody. I have to reach out to Expedia for them solve their mistake instead of them reaching out to me. I have to have the uncertainty of what will happen to the money I paid for my TWO WAY ticket or even the uncertainty of my trip because nobody from Expedia is giving me a solution. I know there is no need for an intermediate party these days. I rather deal directly with the airline which unlike Expedia gave me a great speedy service when I contacted them yesterday        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive

Guess what they sitll havnt replied anyway. I also emailed the 'right department' myself at least twice.After reading so many 1 star reviews on this site, of people saying exactly the same thing as me im going to report this to watch dog or something because this company cant get away with ignoring their customers like this. i would encourage all other people to do the same, then maybe Expedia will finally change its disgusting ways.The reviews say it all!        	                2	1	Thursday	expedia	negative

I said how can that be he said mam it's not me is out system.... so i said ok please hurry and go I confirmed over and over sir are you saying my total would be $2090.00 he said yes he would process the payment. log story short he took out of my back account $ 3058.00 i told him what was going on and all he said was let me look into this and ended up transferring me to another department with notice.

1124	"            Bought a roundtrip flight from NY to Miami, they have a best price guarantee program, which means in 24hrs or less from booking a flight you see same flight for less you get refunded the difference.... well it took 3 separate phone calls (45mins each) to get that difference of $45. I even had to speak to a ""supervisor"" because they just couldnt believe I had found a cheaper flight, which thankfully I had taken a screenshot of. Had to send emails and speak to a bunch of different people to actually believe me. I finally got the refund after a month of hassle. Fast forward another month I ended up having to cancel that trip very last minute, so I received a credit for it. Now we are 5mths since receiving that credit... to book another flight using that credit you must call online (with multiple hold times and many technical issues). Spoke to a lady for about 40mins to get onto a new flight using that credit. They sent me an email about confirmation of the charge for the difference of $3 for the new flight. she said I should receive new itinerary within 24hrs. Its been 5 days now....no itinerary. I am now on the phone with them and they are so ""very sorry"" but whoever I spoke to never booked my flight....now I am trying to rebook but that flight I originally wanted is no longer available.

1140	            I booked car hire, packaged with flights using Expedia.com.  When I arrived at my destination I was told that I could not drive the car that I had booked as there was no level of basic insurance on the car in order to make it legal to drive on the roads.  I was presented with three options by the vendor, Europcar: (1) pay €5000 and sign an unlimed liability document for the total value of the car of €25000 - summarised by the sales assistant as 'if you so much as scratch it you own it', (2) pay €560 in insurance fees €56 X 10 days (to place this in context, the total car hire booking was approx €130), or (3) abandon the Expedia.com booking altogether and open a new sale direct with Europcar at rack rates for €460.   Expedia had a 40 minute call queue. I got through to an agent who billed $100 to my MasterCard for alternative insurance which would fix the problem.  When I returned to the car hire desk, the insurance I had paid for was null and void.   I was left stranded in the airport and an Expedia 'expert' cut me off on the next call by transferring me to a Payless.com representative who I was told had a solution but in actual fact she told me that there was 'nothing she could do'.  It was approaching 1.00am at this point.  The rental desks then all closed for the night.   Luckily this all happened in Dublin, Ireland, a familiar and safe city but I would have been in a potentially quite dangerous situation if this was Nairobi.

1148	"            Dear Expedia.com,I've been a customer/user of yours for a good number of years now.  Recently, however, I experienced an encounter with your Customer Service Team that has left a very sour taste in my mouth, an encounter that will probably keep me from using your services ever again, unfortunately.My wife and I recently took a trip to Europe to celebrate our honeymoon.  We booked our tickets to Paris, our hotel in Paris and our flight back to the US all through Expedia.com.  While in Europe, we traveled around to a few different countries, specifically the UK and Italy.When planning our honeymoon, we had originally thought to fly from London to Venice, staying a few days in each city.  However, when trying to book plane tickets through Expedia.com to Venice, the website wouldn't work.  It took us to an error page whenever we tried to buy the plane tickets.  So, we adjusted our plans and bought tickets through Expedia.com to Florence (from London) instead of to Venice.  The website worked for us this time around and we received a confirmation email from Expedia.com shortly after purchasing the Florence tickets.Now, fast forward to our last night in London on our honeymoon (March 12).  That night, we received an email from Expedia.com notifying/reminding us of our upcoming trip to Florence the next day.  We ALSO received an email from Expedia.com notifying/reminding us of our trip to Venice!  This was news to us!  This was the first time ever hearing anything about Venice after our initial failed attempt to purchase tickets through Expedia.com, for which we did not get a confirmation page on the website nor did we receive a confirmation email like we did for the tickets to Florence.  So, as far as we were concerned, we never purchased tickets to Venice.We made a very expensive call to Expedia.com Customer Service from London to try to remedy the error.  We spoke to a Representative who admitted to the error on Expedia's end, but would not refund us anything, citing company policy.  When I asked to speak to a Supervisor, the Representation refused to let me do so.  I flat out asked, ""So, you're refusing to let me speak to your supervisor?""  To which the Representative responded, ""Yes.""  That alone was enough to ruffle my feathers.  I ended the call then since it was clear I was getting no where with this Representative.I emailed my father in Ohio, asking him to help since I couldn't afford another pricey international phone call.  I gave him all the information I had and asked him to call Expedia.com on my behalf.  He did so and ran into the same opposition I did earlier.  However, he was a bit more forceful and eventually was transferred to a Supervisor.  Then, after some more conversation, my father was transferred to that Supervisor's Supervisor.  Please note that this whole time on the phone my father was being told again and again that there was nothing Expedia.com could do EVEN THOUGH IT WAS YOUR FAULT.  So, after 4.5 hours on the phone with Customer Service, Expedia.com finally agreed to give me a full refund.  The Customer Service Team, after exploring it further, agreed that the error was due to their website and that we were right in asking for a refund - something we had been trying to tell them this whole time!  I am pleased with the outcome but completely appalled by the path to that outcome.  A customer should be taken seriously and listened to.  I was not treated this way.  Also, this matter should not have taken 4.5 hours to resolve.  That is time that my father will not get back and time that should not have been taken from him.  This experience also put a lot of stress on our honeymoon, a time that should have been relaxing and enjoyable for me and my wife.When all was said and done, we were very disappointed in Expedia.com.  We still are.  I doubt we will ever use Expedia.com again and will discourage our friends and family from using it, too, citing this negative experience as a reason why.  I hope you take this email seriously and implement changes to your Customer Service Team as a result.  Maybe allow Representatives to make more decisions on the front line or encourage Representatives to allow customers to speak to Supervisors, not purposefully denying customers when they ask.  No one else should have to suffer through what we suffered through to get a refund for an error caused by Expedia.com.Sincerely,Ben        "	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

1150	"            I was in Buenos Aires, Argentina 3/2/16 through 3/8/16 and booked a round trip transfer from EZE airport to downtown hotels with Gray Line Tours of Argentina, through Expedia's website. Count #1: False Advertising - To begin with Expedia advertised as follows: ""Private Towncar: Ezeiza Airport (EZE): Roundtrip for Hotels."" Well on the day of my arrival, there was no Town Car as was advertised. Instead there was a Fiat econo-box that I could barely fit into given my height (hence the rationale for the Town Car). Count #2: Breach of Contract/Failure to Perform - Now, the major headache I experienced was on the return leg back to the airport. Several attempts to contact Gray Line Tours of Argentina to confirm the transfer back to the airport proved unsuccessful, both via e-mail and telephonically, via the hotel's concierge. I even sent several e-mails to an Ezequiel Perez (e.perez@graylineargentina.), the person with whom I confirmed the EZE pickup with originally, as well as to reconfirm@graylineargentina. but to no avail. However, in spite of these failed attempts, on a whim I waited for someone from Gray Line Tours to pickup me up nonetheless at the time, 5:00 p.m., that I specified. I then had to hail a cab at the last minute, lest I missed my flight back to Washington, DC.  And attempts to collect the money, $250.00, I tendered to Expedia.com, the ring leaders in this mess, has been fraught with utter frustration. When I contacted Expedia, the rep. stated that she couldn't get ahold of anyone at Gray Line, for it was too early in the morning according to U.S. Mountain Standard Time. Now this is utter nonsense, for on the voucher, Gray Line stated their business hours as 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, daily local time. When I was talking to the Expedia rep. about a refund, it was 10:57 AM, Buenos Aires time. The real disappoint here is really with Expeida.com, for they should do a better job of vetting these third-party providers. I have done exactly $17,498.08 worth of travel business through Expedia.com and will not do another penny with them after this experience, not to mention Gray Line Tours. Really, I thought the whole point behind going through companies like Expedia was to lessen the likelihood or even eliminate the possibility of this kind of stuff happening. Never again with either company...        "	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

1152	"            Booked NY to Cancun trip on phone Feb 22 Itinerary because I had called to ask a simple question before pressing button to book on line, but agent insisted on booking for me. She was supposed to match exact itinerary &amp; price on my screen. She said yes, but after 45 mins of questions re: personal info, told me price had changed &amp; was more $. Booked anyway since I had already wasted all that time w/her. I didn’t get confirmation email, had issues w/my account and called twice about this (every call was 45mins). The second time I called I thought it would be fare that, with all the trouble I had gone through with my account, that they should credit me for the extra money I paid by booking on the phone when on line the price was $100 less. After being an 1hr on the phone, finally supervisor agreed to give me a ""voucher"" that could only be used when booking packages. Not what I wanted (I wanted a credit in my card) but I was exhausted of being on the phone, so I accepted. The day before my trip, I realized the original phone agent didn't include the roundtrip airport transfer that was part of the package she was supposed to book. Had to call again (another 45 minutes- 1hr!!) Manager said they couldn't included it and that I had to book through Expedia &amp; that they will refund my credit card. I did that and got an email from the manager saying I will be getting the refund. Got the airport to hotel transfer, but the hotel to airport transfer was misteriously  ""cancelled"". Had to call Expedia from Cancun hotel. After 30 minutes of waiting, spoke to another manager who gave no explanation for cancellation&amp; said I had to book again through Expedia. I was in the lobby of the hotel with no computer!!! I insisted they refund me w/receipt I get from the airport transfer provider directly. After at leats 45 minutes on the phone, he agreed. Called Expedia when I was back in NY and a manager told me they can't refund cause I didn't book through them even though the previous manager gave me a Ref#475843 so that they ""know what to do"" when I called. I said they need to listen to recordings to confirm the manager agreed to refund with receipt, but new manager said they don’t have recorded conversations. After over 2 hours, I got to a supervisor who told me to email the receipt of airport transfer payment to expedia.com. In my frustration of 2+ hrs on phone, I didn't realize that’s NOT an email address. So, I had to call again Expedia for an email address, which is not easy to find on the website (or is not there at all!). The customer representative din't know the customer service email, so it took like 10-15 minutes (really?!!).I found out from my Amex that Expedia didn't request payment for the  onlinebook of the transfer (which I did), so the charge on my credit card was cancelled. Expedia didn't collect the money from Amex, so they didn't pay the transfer provider. The provider, in turn, cancelled my airport transfer. This was Expedia's idea of ""refunding"" me for cost of the transfer!!! And Expedia won't admit it. I;m still waiting for the supervisor to get back to me on the refund of the transfer cost I booked directly with the provider. Expedia needs to stop lying and take responsibility for what what they say/do and deliver honest service to their customers!!!        "	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	positive
1153	            First off, i wonder if writing a review on Expedia will make a difference in any way?  I have dealt with expedia multiple times and they screwed up to some degree many of those times, but they made it right each time and the best price speaks volumes.  This last time they emailed me indicating my resort could no longer honour my reservation, but they would offer comparable accommodations in my final destination or two other locations.  I took one of the the locations, paid a 800$ upgrade and then  ( once it was booked)  was told i could not alter my flights in any way.  WHy offer other locations knowing i could not alter my flights?  After multiple calls and over 6 hours on hold over 3 calls ( one call 3 hours 38 min. 1 second on hold) They said they would fix the the flights and i though things were resolved....they they called back and said they changed their minds and I get nothing...I kid you not. A Corporate supervisor overturned customer service's decision to make things right.  So I paid over 1700 more not to lose my vacation.......I am feeling anger...and this is all I can do about it. Unsatisfying to say the least.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	positive
1154	            The day after I booked a hotel, this exact same room was available on Expedia for over $10 less a night.

After researching he couldn't understand the reasoning for this second charge for $70.00 and after I was told that, he then put me on hold again to ""investigate further"", he stated, then I was hung up on AGAIN after waiting a another 30minutes for him to get back with me to explain this bogus charge....total joke!!!I'll never use them again !!! Worst customer service ever and Expedia is getting away with ripping people off by overcharging customers , hoping we won't notice the separate charges on our accounts...horrible company!They need to be investigated, this has obviously happened to many other customers after looking at their reviews online , wish I would of done that first before dealing with Expedia...never again.

1158	            The price guarantee policy is very misleading and they ask you to submit a screen shot and web link to the company that has a cheaper price. You will then get rejected if your screen shot does not have all the information that they requested that is on another link that you have to go to. They request the web link that contains all the info but will not review that.  If you get rejected you can not resubmit. If you call they put you on hold for a long time and come back with sorry...nothing they can do. Saying sorry just does not cut it. The difference was not that much, but if you are looking for service when you need it....don't hold your breath.

1160	            I have just had an absolutely miserable experience with Getaroom and Expedia. My wife and I are on the last day of a mini-honeymoon and spending the night in SF - when we arrived at our hotel, they told us that Expedia had cancelled our reservation and they were fully booked, and we needed to work with you on a resolution. After 5 customer service professionals over 2+ hours, they FINALLY rebooked us at another hotel (after repeatedly telling us you didn't have our reservation, couldn't refund us, making me prove my credit card was charged, and couldn't confirm us at another hotel, then asking us to pay an additional $200 to switch us to another comparable hotel. After watching our horrible experience (and participating in it - Expedia called them three times, and they were also on hold with you for 30+ minutes) the hotel whose lobby we were using recommended we just book with them directly next time. That is probably what we will do in the future, and encourage all of our friends to do. This was an awful experience - the worst I've ever had with an online booking. Finally, I got a receipt showing a charge for $389 after Expedia representatives told me there would be no additional charges - I have told my credit card company to block any charges just in case.        	                2	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

1165	            Easy-to-use website and generally things have run smoothly in the past with expedia. However, this time there was a problem with my flight and how it was handled was very disappointing compared to other agents. my flight was changed and I wanted to apply for a refund, which they didn't make obvious was a possibility but I knew from the past and other agents. I had to call them and speak to them 3 times for this refund. their whole customer service department seems to be in India. the second time they said they had no record of my call and had not applied for the refund. the third time they couldn't explain why they hadn't refunded me the 3 pound admin charge but would refund it now. then on checking my bank statement I realised that they had charged me 4.88 pounds extra that didn't appear on the receipt and is not clear what it is about. so they charge you a different amount to the authorisation from the bank. unfortunately, after 3-4 emails to their customer service department they would not answer this question but kept sending me confirmations of the 3-pound refund for their own admin charge. I have never been ignored like this before. I will be discussing this discrepancy in payment and refund with my bank and I will be filling out a form to Trading Standards as well. in addition, their staff in India are obviously not native speakers of English but one of them was laughing at me on the phone for not understanding him. Unfortunately, I made a new booking with them before I became aware of any of this. It will be my last one.        	                5	2	Saturday	expedia	negative
1166	            I can't believe expedia is still in business. Worst customer service team I've EVER had to deal with. First, they lied to me about their policy; team is inconsistent with their training. Also based in Philippines and constantly put you on hold to verify information with airlines! When rebooking my trip, it would literally take 1-3hours to get this done. I had to book 4 different flight credits. During this time, they would put me on hold for 25-30 minutes to confirm codes of something with the airlines “SOMEHOW” lines would hang up!! With no exaggeration, it happened at LEAST 4-5 times. Of course they do NOT call you back, even though they say they will. So you have to call and wait 15-20 mins, then tell them again what you want to do, they have to verify with the airline (and if you’re lucky and the line doesn’t magically disconnect- by the way, lazy representatives will hang up if its not a simple rebook) Then you finally get to speak to a ‘Supervisor’. Whom you have to tell the WHOLE thing to (names of the passenger, date of births, where and when to fly- OH wait they have to check a damn AIRLINE CODE. Another hold and cross your fingers they don’t hang up. I’m sure you get the point. Extremely unprofessional and unappreciative of their customers.  I think the most frustrating thing was the repetition of EVERYTHING to agents who have absolutely little authority. This poor customer service is also reflected the lack of a good CRM (customer relationship management) program where they can document the clients previous calls and discussions with other agents. ALSO they can’t even transfer you to agents you have spoke to in the past. Each and every single time I called I was starting over in a process where the agents know less than I do. EVENTUALLY.. the only way I was able to rebook is getting very angry and dealing with the airline myself. HA! So they actually need other companies to service their clients. That how terrible expedia’s customer service is. I won’t deal with them again and strongly urge you no to either.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative
1167	"            1. You get what you pay for. Expecting the same caliber of service when paying half the price is usually your first mistake2. Learn how to read and understand terms and conditions of a contract BEFORE you enter it.3. When you book a NO CANCELLATION, NON REFUNDABLE reservation, don't have a meltdown when you're held to the legally binding terms you agreed to when booking. Hotels recover the lost revenue these cheap  Expedia ""guests"" bring by retaining higher amounts of what you've agreed to pay when you decide to cancel at the last minute. Yes, often that cancellation fee is 100%. Had you read your booking , you would've known this BEFORE you agreed and signed..4. If the terms for the deal offered at the incredibly cheap price you want to pay dictate that amenities are NOT guaranteed and are subject to availability upon check in, then that's how it is.The best advice to the cheap people who are only interested in freebies and discounts?

I spoke to customer service and was told the cause of this was a glitch. No reminder emails were sent for this booking. No check in status emails were sent for this booking. The supervisor of the call center whom I talked to on 3/9/2016 at 10 am CT agreed that Expedia offers an inconstant level of customer service in these matters. Overall I am super frustrated with Expedia and will frankly never use them to book another trip.

I have called them 5 times over the space of 5 weeks. Every time I call, they say it is being escalated and someone will get back to me. And nobody Ever does.

1170	"            I booked a weekend trip through Expedia over two months ago. Our reservation was for a three night stay in a single room with two queen beds at the Columbus Marriott Northwest in Dublin, Ohio. Three days before our trip I called the Hotel to confirm our reservation. We were informed that Expedia had only booked us for two nights instead of three. Our confirmation email that we received months ago confirmed that we had been booked and PAID for three nights. I called Expedia and the woman I spoke to assured me that although there had been an error on their end it was fixed and we would be set to check in for the correct amount of days. We got to the Marriott at 1 am on the night we were supposed to check in (due to a snow storm) and were informed that there was no reservation for us until the next night and that they had no available rooms so they had to turn us away. Not only did they say that but they also informed us that they had to turn away MULTIPLE people that night who had booked through Expedia for the same reason. Once again I spent about an hour on the phone with Expedia trying to fix this situation since we had to be up early the next morning for our trip. Then ended up sending us to another hotel close by for that night which was extremely inconvenient because it's now 2 am and we had to unpack everything to get ready for the next day and then repack by the next morning to check out which wasted time on our short vacation. We asked if Expedia would just switch our reservation to that hotel for all three days so we wouldn't have to waste time and part of our trip moving to the other hotel in the morning. They told us that we would be responsible for cancellation fees and that they would only cover what we paid for the Marriott since the hotel they CHOSE to put us in was more expensive. I think that this is AWFUL customer service. If your company makes a mistake not once but twice on someones reservation the least they can do is cover the part of the trip that they messed up. Not only did they refuse to give us any consolation for the hassle that they caused us, but the woman I spoke to got annoyed with me for being upset about the situation and informed me that she didn't have to fix anything if she didn't want to. Terrible business move. So we decide there's nothing to do expect spend one night at one hotel and then move to the Marriott the next day. Morning comes and we are all packed and ready to get our trip started. I run into the lobby of the hotel to hand them our keys to check out. The woman at the front desk informs me that Expedia booked that room for TWO nights (that they already told me they won't pay for) and we can't checkout because there is a 24 hour cancellation policy. Once again I find myself wasting time on the phone with Expedia because now we have TWO hotels for the night. I'd like to point out that every time I called Expedia I was transferred multiple times and had to reexplain the situation over and over again. Expedia tells me that if we chose to stay at the Hotel that is more expensive (even though they booked it for two nights because they screwed up...again) that we would be responsible for paying for that night. So an hour later of just sitting in a lobby on our vacation Expedia finally cancels the one hotel and sends us on our way to the Marriot. We checked into the Marriot and got into our room with two double beds, not two queen beds. This wouldn't have been an issue normally but we had two larger people on the trip who could barely fit into the bed together. We called the front desk to see if there had been yet another mistake and they informed us that they don't even have rooms with two queen beds. So the information that was on Expedia was not true. At this point I was so worn out with Expedia that I decided to just let it go and our friends had to make it work with two uncomfortable nights. I never write bad reviews for places. I am very flexible and laid back but this was just unacceptable. If I had a business and my employees screwed up THREE times for a three day weekend trip I would do anything I could to make sure that customer was happy. I wasn't expecting them to pay for our trip but I do believe we should have at least been given the curtesy of staying in the nicer hotel for three nights with them paying the difference between what we had already paid. Instead we had to move around while we were supposed to be out enjoying our trip. I spent a total of three hours and fifteen minutes on the phone with them during this ""vacation."" This added so much stress to our trip and set us back with our arrival times that we missed half a day at our convention that we paid to be at because of them. I will NEVER book through Expedia again and the three others on the trip feel the same way.

1172	            Booked on Expedia for a hotel that was advertised at 125 plus tax but ended up paying 189 plus tax and was told that the rate was non-refundable by Expedia they call the hotel and again the response was nonrefundable.  Bottom line do not book with Expedia as they advertise prices that are incorrect.  I've never had any problems like this with any other travel website and usually book with Priceline or hotwire.        	                2	1	Sunday	expedia	positive
1173	            Wish I could leave zero stars. Where to begin. Last year we booked a trip through EXPEDIA on memorial weekend. They took our money and we drove 6 hours to our destination to find out they canceled our reservation with no warning and no refund. It was memorial weekend so there were no hotels available and EXPEDIA did not care at all and did nothing about it. So dumb of us we tried to book another trip with them where they so called do price match guarantee.. False advertisement!!!!!!!! We sent them 5 emails and they kept declining it with no reason. We canceled the reservation with EXPEDIA and will never book anything through them again!!!! Be warned they don't price match and they only care about taking your money.

It is a rip-off. talked to 2 supervisors Don, and Mike, for over an hour (in the phillipines, i think). thought i was getting somewhere with this problem, and then they hung up. 2x.

Thought we were covered.Would not honor their agreement...I would go so far as to call it a scam...Never use expedia/(thieves)!!! unless you like being on the phone for 6 1/2 hours hoping for the best...hope I can save you this nightmare...wrecked our trip        	                2	1	Saturday	expedia	positive
1178	            The website directed me to BOOK NOW having completed my details and filled in my credit card details (£9,000 credit available). Website didn't process the transaction and advised me to wait a few minutes and press 'Try again' button. After the fourth attempt, I was advised by the website that I should try a different card for payment. Somewhat confused, as the holiday was less than £6,000, I phoned credit card company to be informed credit limit was reached with two exactly the same payments of over £4,000 having been sent to Expedia but not yet taken by them. The nightmare began as I then spent one hour on the phone to Expedia customer services. They couldn't explain why the payment wasn't taken the first time and even suggested that it may be because the price I had been told I had to pay had been increased, therefore it had been bounced. I asked for my money back to my credit card company. I was told this would take 72 hours.Next day the money was returned, to then find out there were two further transactions totalling over £8,000 waiting to be rejected by Expedia, and that I couldn't have any credit until this was done. Credit card company advised me that to have it done immediately, all Expedia had to do was send a short fax explaining they were not going to take the £8,000 and that my credit could be restored. Expedia then proceeded to bounce me via three Customer services reps, who refused to send a simple fax to explain the company would not take my money. Utterly useless and without a doubt the worst company I have had the pleasure to deal with.Booking a holiday should be a pleasure and something to look forward to. Well done Expedia for completing destroying that for me and my family......SLEEP WELL, IDIOTS.        	                2	1	Friday	expedia	positive
1179	"            I booked a roundtrip flight from Detroit to Vancouver with Expedia. Several weeks later, I got an email from Expedia saying that the airlines had changed their schedule (which I am now skeptical of) and that I needed to contact an Expedia representative. My original outbound flight involved a 2 hour layover. They tried to put me on one with a 7 hour layover instead. I had to argue with them about that and explain that I didn't pay for a 7 hour layover, only 2 hours. So they agreed to put me on a flight with a similar layover to the original and I thought I was all set. Only a mild inconvenience.Then, as my trip got nearer, I attempted to log into the airline's website and make sure everything was set. It turns out that in the process of the Expedia agent changing my outbound flight, they also changed my inbound flight to also be a Detroit to Vancouver route. So somehow, I was supposed to fly from Detroit to Vancouver and then Detroit to Vancouver again to get home a week later.I called Expedia back and spent over 2 hours on the phone, being passed from agent to agent, getting disconnected, and having to reexplain their error multiple times to them. This was made more complicated by the fact that none of their agents are native English speakers and just provide scripted robotic responses to everything. So, after 2 hours, they finally put me back on the original flight I had correctly booked. They said I'd be able to view the reservation within 24 hours.So I check after 24 hours - nothing. I give them the benefit of the doubt and wait another day. Still nothing. So this morning, I spent another 2 hours on the phone with them, was passed around to different agents, was disconnected, etc. At the end, the last supervisor said he'd give me a refund for my inbound flight. So here I was thinking, ""Finally, the hours I've wasted are being recognized and compensated."" Wrong - the guy just meant that Expedia was going to be a responsible business and not charge me for the rebooking of the flight that was made in their error. I had to explain to the (non-native English speaking) agent that a refund is not the same as not fraudulently charging me twice for something in their error. I asked him what they could offer me for the 4+ hours of my life that I had spent fixing their mistakes and he could only offer me a $50 credit for a future Expedia purchase. Not a chance I will ever do business with them.Do not be lured to Expedia by the prospect of saving $5 or $10 on a flight. It is not worth the time, energy, sanity, etc. that goes into the process. I will never make this mistake again. I'm back to booking my flights directly with airlines, as I have for years without hassle.        "	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative
1180	            Booked a holiday in Rome with them. They managed to get me a flight (wait for it) arriving at Fiumicino at 10.30pm. Paid for it. The hotel owner sent me an email confirming my booking and offering taxi service. When I explained that I had taken care of it and what time he should expect us, he mentioned that there would be a 50 euros surcharge for late check-in and that this should have been picked up by Expedia. Back to Expedia, Mr. DIPENDI supervisor sent me a curt reply saying this was CLEARLY stated on the booking page. So clearly that I didn't see it. In other words they had got my money, now who cares.

My family and I booked a room at the Royalton White Sands Hotel, Jamaica through Expedia.  The Royalton did not give us the right room, did the BAIT and SWITCH routine, gave us a much smaller room, tried to call it an upgrade, etc.  Ruined my family's vacation as we were very cramped in this room.  I called EXPEDIA while in Jamaica, they gave me no help.  I wanted my money back, and EXPEDIA said they had to have permission from the hotel to give me my money back and the hotel wouldn't give it.  And that was it.  EXPEDIA will not advocate for you.  DO NOT BOOK THROUGH THEM.  USE A TRAVEL AGENT!!!  We met people at the terrible ROYALTON WHITE SANDS HOTEL  who also got the BAIT AND SWITCH routine, who booked through a travel agent, and their travel agent forced the terrible ROYALTON WHITE SANDS HOTEL, JAMAICA to make it right with them.

1190	            I recently booked a flight to the US and the onto Honduras with Expedia and let me tell you it was the worst thing I have ever done.A week after booking my flights there was World Health Organisation warning of a virus that has potentially life changing side effects for couples planning to have a baby that had affected large parts of South America including Honduras. I contacted Expedia to ask if I could change the second leg of my flight (and was happy to pay for the new flight) or just have the US as my final destination due to this warning as my partner and I are planning to have a baby later this year. Firstly I was told that it wasn't within Expedia's power to change the flight and I had to contact the carrier which I did, they told me it was only Expedia that could do any changes as I had paid them my money. I phoned again, was cut off twice and then when I did get through to someone they promised to call back and never did. The call centre staff are obviously not based in the UK and therefore failed to understand my concerns and questions.  Sadly Expedia's customer service department is totally customer unfriendly has no flexibility and is unprofessional in the extreme. Maybe Expedia is big enough that it really doesn't care or need my money but in day and age when customers have a range of choices on who to spend their hard earned money they should care more. I will certainly be recommending to my friends, work colleagues and anyone else who might be looking to use Expedia to seriously consider not doing so..Please please please find another more customer friendly organisation to spend your money with other than Expedia.        	                6	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

I called up their call centre and they advised me to pay the difference of fare and amend the tickets and then they connected me to IVR. This is where the issue started. Their IVR never works and after trying for couple of days and being put on hold for hours finally the agent says sorry we can't amend your flight and I left with no other option as to cancel my flight and book a fresh ticket directly with airlines. This way I had to pay additional amount from my pockets. Just boasting world's best travel service provider doesn't work. They need to have functionality to do amendments online as well and if not then give alternative to customer when your IVR doesn’t work. Totally unacceptable and must be avoided.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	neutral
1193	            As a frequent customer I’m writing in regards to a very distasteful experience I had with your company.  I booked a flight to Paris for 3 days and then an ongoing journey to New Delhi, India from Toronto on Dec 23rd, 2015 through Expedia.Com.   As loyal customer who frequently utilises the services of Expedia and going by the previous excellent experiences I have had with them, I decided to book a month long vacation for 2 countries from Expedia again.The first leg was from Toronto (YYZ) to New York (JFK).  I left for the airport at 9:30am in the morning as I had 2 bags to be checked in. When I reached American Airlines counter (operated under BA) they did not let me board the flight BA 5239 which was scheduled for 12:10pm, reason being that Expedia changed my itinerary without informing me to a flight in the evening that was scheduled to depart at 6:30pm. This change in itinerary made no sense because there was connecting flight on the same day from JFK to Paris CDG BA 1534 which for which the departure time was 5:15 pm. After an hour on hold I felt a little dismayed, and after two hours I felt disgruntled.  At one point someone answered, but I was quickly put back on hold. After hours of calling Expedia and British airways simultaneously at the airport and no cooperation from the call centre, the airline crew made me board the AA 4710 flight to New York  LGA that was originally scheduled to depart at 11:50 am but got delayed. The flight did not leave the airport  until 2 pm due to a technical problem at LGA airport where the flights were not able to go in and out of the airport. By this time, I was panicking and stressing as I had to land to LGA, wait for my luggage 2 checked in bags, collect them and then take a cab to JFK.  The flight landed around 3:45pm. I quickly got out and ran towards the conveyer belt to collect my luggage which was out by 4:10pm. As soon as I got out of LGA, I saw that it was pouring cats and dogs and I got an idea about the bad traffic. I took a cab to JFK from LGA, called up the airlines on my way and explained my situation and they asked me to contact Expedia since it was Expedia’s fault since the beginning. This was happening for the nth time and I was just feeling helpless. I still decided to go to the airport knowing that I was not going to make it for my 5:15 pm flight to Paris which was scheduled to depart on time. It took me an hour to get to JFK due to terrible rain, causing more traffic for which I had to pay the cab driver $65 US Dollars.It was past 5 and I went directly to the rebooking counter of AA as my flight BA 1534 was operated by them. The waiting for time for me to get to the counter was 2 hours.  At this point I was exhausted as I had been in transit for more than 8 hours and I had to wait for 2 more hours in the queue.  Finally reached the counter at 7:10 pm. Luckily the agent who was helping me out was very nice and efficient and got me another flight to Paris through Air France AF0007 that was going to depart at 8:35 pm. Not only that, she also asked a porter to help me out from terminal 8 was to terminal 1 for Air France which made my travel easier and faster. I finally made it to the Air France counter by 7:25 pm. By this time I was hoping that they would help me out in quick security process for which I could see a good an hour queue. As soon I reached the counter, they took 10 mins to see whether they could give me a seat since it was a request made by AA. After this was sorted, they said me to pay $100 US Dollars as they have one bag check in policy. I was flustered and asked them to contact AA and help me out with this but they refused. I also asked them to help me out with the faster security process and the agent refused and said the flight will be delayed by 15 mins so I don’t need to worry. It was already 7:50pm and I have had a terrible experience with Air France already within a span of 25 mins. I went ahead and joined the queue and requested each of one of the passenger standing before me to let me go through the security so that I could board my flight. Thankfully that worked out in my favour and I made it to the gate on time. I reached Paris CDG after 11:00 am on 24th December. 3 and a half hours later than my original scheduled flight. Since I had made a prior pick up booking from the airport to the hotel, I had already missed my free shuttle provided by the hotel as the flight got delayed and there was no way to contact the hotel due to no battery in my phone.  I had to incur another $67 US Dollars to get to my hotel in Paris from the airport by arranging a cab for myself. On my way back from New Delhi to Toronto, I had to extend my trip by 7 days due to an emergency and I had informed the airlines 7 days in advance about changing my trip including the method of payment I’ll be paying for the change. Few days later I did get an email about the trip change that said clearly that I don’t need to contact the airlines for reconfirmation.  However,  on the day of my travel, I called the airlines to help me out as I was unable to check in online. BA again told me that my flight wasn’t confirmed and it was again Expedia’s fault and I had to contact them again. I called Expedia and requested them to contact BA and they put me on hold for half an hour and came back saying that I need to call them. Finally I called them again and went through the entire process of telling them the entire story and they asked me to go the airport as soon as I can since they couldn’t confirm my flight as it takes at least 4 hours to generate a new ticket. I reached the airport and explained my situation to the agent on BA counter. She was very helpful as she spoke to the call centre for about an hour and asked me to pay additional charges upfront and issued me a ticket right away.  I had spent over $ 250 in additional costs like expensive airport meals, paying baggage fees and cab travel expenses.  These costs add up, but what really is more hurting is the way that I felt like Airlines and Expedia handled the situation. The amount of stress and waste of time I had to go through due to these failures. At times, the employees, rather than helping, were simply passing us along without the help that Ineeded.  It was a series of problems, one on top of another.  Not just a single failure to perform, which can definitely be understood.I do understand that mistakes happen. However I don’t understand the lack of customer service that I received consistently.  I felt disregarded and unvalued.  I realize many customers experienced delays and similar problems, but I still felt like things could have been handled better.  I would like to be able to continue to fly with Airlines and use Expedia, but as I’m sure you understand we have hesitations now due to this horrific experience.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	neutral

1196	            I was looking up a trip using Expedia.ca and found one that was perfect for me... Or so I thought. The flight was a round trip with British Airways from Toronto, ON to Rome, Italy with a layover in London the hotel was Hotel Ivanhoe and was for a 6 night stay. Expedia.ca quoted the trip at $1,166.95 Canadian Dollars. After filling out all the necessary flight and payment information I went to click confirm and the browser closed. I assumed it was a glitch and tried again with no luck. I decided to call the 1-800 number. The agent found me the same hotel and the same flight and wanted to charge me $2,600. WAIT WHAT!! After asking the agent why their was a discrepancy they told me that hotel prices can go up. Having my computer in front of me I hit refresh and the prices did not change. I asked why this was and did not get a response I was told to book now and if I was right about the price they would refund the money and give me a $50 voucher so I win!! I declined this offer as I don't win when the price of my trip magically increases by over $1,000 with no explanation as to why I'm not see that price online.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive
1197	            In November we very excitedly booked a Family Vacation so we could celebrate the end of chemotherapy for our Family Member. With the outbreak of the Zika virus, two of our daughters were advised by their Doctors not to travel to countries affected by Zika and provided Doctors Notes to substantiate same.We notified Expedia for TD that we needed to change our destination or cancel. This involved 15 days of lengthy phone calls (2-3 hours at a time)  with multiple promises that someone would call us back within 24 hours (which never happened). We were repeatedly put on hold for extended periods. It is of note that the center taking these calls is located in Egypt. Eventually, we were offered a travel credit to be used within 1 year for our daughters at risk. (Nothing for the rest of us)The fact that our daughters would not be able to travel within the year with an infant who wasn't even old enough to have all their immunizations fell on deaf ears. We are extremely disappointed and frustrated that Expedia for TD was difficult to deal with and further frustrated that they have ignored World Health Organizations declaration of the Zika virus being a Global Emergency. I would be very hesitant to book travel with them again and would advise other customers / travellers of the lack of support, unreasonable solutions and frustration that goes along with Expedia for TD.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1198	            Never again will I use Expedia. Their own website showed a rate of 255 a night but when I went to check out it showed 269 a night. I called customer service where they said they had to charge me the 269 but submit a claim for the adjusted Price. Now they will not honor the price after customer service told me this wasn't an issue   I spent 45 min with a supervisor who told me she couldn't do anything and was rude. Never again. They are a scam        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative
1199	            Picked a hotel deal where name of hotel is revealed once you've booked. It promised free internet access at hotel as the top amenity, but once it revealed the name of the hotel was informed that internet access wasn't free. Not a large amount of money, but that's not the point. The point is to be able to trust information and promises made on the website. Terrible customer service by a man who interrupted me when I was trying to speak and wouldn't be quiet and listen. He told me the terms and conditions I agreed to said the amenities weren't guaranteed, therefore Expedia would not refund the equivalent I double checked there was NOTHING written to that effect on the website. Again I know it's not much money, my point is for others to know that the amenities on the secret hotel deals are not necessarily the ones that are promised.        	                3	2	Saturday	expedia	positive
1200	            I booked my trip with Expedia (which included two different airlines for departure and return). I received a confirmation mail from Expedia that my trip was confirmed, however when I went to check my trip on the airlines (manage my bookings) I noticed that the airline did not issue me a ticket. I called Expedia and they discovered that there was some issue between the two airlines that were involved in my trip. Nothing to do with me. They put me on hold, and I'm still holding from person to person for 3 hrs!!!!!! Finally someone from cooperate answered and told me they will refund my trip but I will have to pay the refund fee!!!!!!!!!!!! I am currently still on hold trying to sort this issue out. Absolutely horrible service. I booked on Expedia for convenience, I received a confirmation that my trip is confirmed, what happens after that is there issue not mine, if the service can not be delivered to me I should receive a refund in full,  and yet I'm being dragged and dragged from one person to the next trying to solve the problem.        	                1	2	Wednesday	expedia	negative

1202	            What a scam.....They advertise a price of $70/night at the Carousel Inn and Suites and switch it to $239/per night when you click though their ad.  I thought I did something wrong, so I did it 3 times.  Then I searched from their site, nope, still $239/night.     Ok, it was a problem with the link over to their site, right? NO.  When I called to ask about the rate, the first person quoted the $239/night rate.  I asked to speak with a supervisor....same thing.  Then he asked if I wanted to speak with someone else, I said yes because he was not able to honor the advertised price.  That's when they put me on hold for...wait for it.....50 minutes, yep...50 minutes!  In this hour, I booked the hotel directly, chance to fill out an FTC Complaint and find this website!       What happened to me is simple, Expedia.com falsely advertised a price they had no intention to honor, plain and simple.  They did this so I would click over to their site where they were charging the exact amount the other major carriers were charging.       Not only did I not book with them, I will never go back to their site again. Further, I will do my best to share this experience with all my friends what a scam they are so this wont happen to them.  What they did was just wrong, so say bye bye Expedia......or should I just put you on hold forever like you did to me????        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative

1205	            I am 13 weeks pregnant. My husband and I booked a vacation package through Expedia to the Caribbean for later on this February. A couple of weeks after booking, we were advised by our doctor not to travel to the area and to cancel our plans because of the recent issues with the Zika Virus and its threats to pregnant women and their babies. We had a doctor's note in hand explaining the issue. I called American Airlines to cancel our reservation and get refunded, and they said there would be no charge to do so; however, cancellation had to be done by Expedia. So, we called Expedia to cancel our trip and get a refund, and we were told by the company that the airline was going to charge a fee for cancelation, which was a lie based on their email itinerary and the airline representative. When we told them that we had spoken to the airline previously and this was not the case, we were told they would look into it. Between waiting for call backs, managers, and a resolution, we waited for approximately 5.5 hours on hold before our call was dropped. We gave up that nobody would be able to resolve our issue, nor was there a desire for anyone to help from their side. We have filed a complaint with the BBB. Their poor customer service and wait times make it impossible for customers to get what they want, even when it's a matter of health and travel advisories from the Center for Disease Control.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
1206	"            Wanted to book an Orlando holiday for a family of 4 in 2016, flying from London. Did all the checks, put the package of flight+hotel+car together, came at a great price, £3552. I saved this itinerary and looked at other options and saved those itineraries, then in the end came back and chose the original £3552 and wanted to book it. So went through the process of paying, all nice and good, only at the end tells the ""Room is not longer available"". Checked separately the room at same hotel, same period, same people and of course its available. Tried several times and failed to book every time so I called the Customer Service. and now the fun begins...the guy put together same itinerary and suddenly it was over £5000 !!! really impossible within a space of few days. he told me first that room not available - I told him it is not true because I can book it. Then he said the flights went up - possible, but in fact again not true as I checked that separately true. in the end he admits that the Discount I was getting on my itinerary, of over £1500, suddenly it is NOT available when I want to book. Hence the price I am getting now is over £5000 compared to my £3552 in my itinerary.How is this possible? It looks to be a big con to attract people with false quotes and then hope convince them to book the expensive one. It is FALSE advertisement and there is a law against this. Someone should just nail this guys.NEVER again Expedia!        "	                11	1	Thursday	expedia	positive

To be fair to the first person (Darnish) I spoke to he did his best, but the overriding impression I got was of speaking to people who mainly speak from scripts.This is the first time I have had an issue like this and having experience Expedia I will not use them again.

Do you accept?""  The second cost is usually three or four times the original cost, so of course I don't accept. They can take their website and shove it where the sun don't shine.

And after 24 hours from booking I got an email from the concerned hotel stating that our booking stands invalid and that the Villa is no more available!!! Instead we could opt for Deluxe Rooms!! When the Expedia officials were contacted they took another 48 hrs for merely reverting to this issue which itself is unacceptable because prices for stay are shooting up especially due to ""Chinese New Year""!And after this the Expedia guys only call back to say that ""Sir, sometimes the Hotel people do such things"". If that is the excuse EXPEDIA the brand name which bears the Tag line post booking:  ""NO NEED TO CALL US TO RECONFIRM THIS RESERVATION"" has to give customers then with what audacity are Expedia guys sitting out there having opened this website????!!!Finally we were forced to cancel and ask for refund because they further asked for another 48 hrs to check!!! Each time we called they needed another 48 hrs to check and in all this wastage of time the prices have shot really high for almost all good hotels and we have lost out on good deals! It would have been better to directly book through the hotel itself!!!Now the only wait is for the refund amount!!

1211	            We have been struggling to get we duplicated itineraries straightened out!  I have repeatedly been told that the hotel would be reimbursed, and we would get travel vouchers for the airline tickets.  But the charges for the hotel still has not been reversed!  To recap:I initially made a reservation online and didn’t get an email confirmation, so I searched for it online and contacted a customer service via email and was told I didn’t have a reservation.  I assumed I must not have clicked through on a button somewhere and made the reservation again.When I got to the end of the reservation confirming my purchase, I recognized the screen and called immediately and explained the situation.  I was told that one would be deleted, and there was no problem. There was a problem!  We found we were charged for both, and one was not reversed.  I have spent hours on the phone with various customer service reps and supervisors and have had them admit it was Expedia’s error and STILL THE HOTEL CHARGES HAVE NOT BEEN REVERSED!!!  I am extremely dissatisfied that we can’t have it all reimbursed but settled for the hotel to be reimbursed. Only, again IT HAS NOT BEEN REIMBURSED.

1220	            I unintentionally booked a vacation in St Maarten through Expedia (had been searching on hotels and after I expressed interest in one, was taken to the Expedia site, but it only became evident after I started to book airplane reservations).  Initially, seemed like a good deal, until the night before my trip and I went to confirm my international airline reservations and I couldn't, because Expedia entered my Passport number erroneously.  American said they couldn't change it, only Expedia could.  First 2 levels of customer service at Expedia couldn't do anything -- told me I had to get to the airport early (flight was already at 7:00 am) and maybe the airlines couldn't do it there. After 2 hours of mostly being on hold, finally a supervisor was able to fix it.  I requested compensation in some form for my time and their error.  Was told that would not happen.  So glad I didn't book any of the other offers they had -- found I could get them much cheaper in Sint Maarten -- I could have booked through expedia shuttle service to my hotel for $20 -- a cab took me there for $12; could have booked an excursion for $100; the hotel booked it for $70.

1221	            I have had a terrible experience with Expedia. It has been since Sunday December 20th that I am still waiting to have this resolved. I made a booking on December 19th 2015 for a 14 person chalet in Blue Mountain for New Year’s Eve. I received a confirmation email from Expedia confirming that my booking has been made. On the morning on December 20th I received an email from reservations services at Expedia that the hotel cannot accommodate my booking. I had called the phone number provided and the gentleman indicated that the chalet was double-booked. They offered to find me another accommodation and cover the price difference due to their error. I spent over 1 hour on the phone with him looking for another location without success. I had decided to call the chalet directly and ask about the problem. To my surprise the hotel was not double booked as indicated by the Expedia employee.Expedia had made a mistake on their part and had allowed me to book the chalet for 1 night when the chalet’s required booking is 3 nights over the holidays. Upon hearing this I quickly called Expedia back to have this resolved. 7 hours later on December 20th and the issue was not resolved.  I have spoken to the reservations department, the supervisor Vin and Ann as well as Rena in corporate among many reservation associates who have been less than helpful in resolving this.My legal representation and I called on Monday and we were given the same run around. No one from Expedia called us back as we were told. I went home Monday night and called Expedia and spoke to Julie who provided me in writing that they would pay for the two additional nights that the hotel requires. She told me to call back during Canadian business hours on Tuesday so their representatives could contact the chalet manager.I called back on Tuesday and received nothing but terrible customer service. My calls were rudely disconnected numerous times by the staff in the reservations department; I was placed on hold for hours once again without any resolution by Expedia. I was encouraged to simply cancel the reservations; I was even sent a cancellation email without consent. I have been faced with the utmost ridiculous customer service. Expedia has acknowledged their mistake verbally and in writing; however, the resolution has yet to be met. In no way is this issue my fault and I do not feel as though 14 people should be penalized on New Year’s Eve for a mistake made by Expedia. I am still waiting to hear back from the supervisor Bobby in the Reservations Department; however, I am not holding my breath to hear from him.I would appreciate that this issue is resolved as soon as possible and that I am compensated for the issues and time lost that I have had the deal with. I will continue to escalate this issue with Expedia and through the media until it is resolved even if it requires legal action.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1222	            I came to this site in hopes of sharing my experience with  Expedia to help others that might think they are getting a deal using their service. I wish now after looking into them further that I had done so earlier. My own complaint would sound very similar to the vast majority  of comments I see here. The original dealings seemed fine until I needed to deal with customer service. To be clear I am not speaking about the person at the other end of the phone, I am speaking about the policies of the company, and their attempt to completely gouge me on a ticket change. A change that would have had a lead time of five months. Now if I had been asking to make a change that would be in a week ok maybe that would have be asking a lot, but how many of you are booking five months ahead.  Even so such a change is always accompanied by a  !!! service !!!  charge, and is part of the risks of traveling, but Airlines typically put their hands back in your pocket to the tune of 150 to 300 dollars Expedia will be easily twice that greater amount. In fact 750 was the quoted cost. Along with the line that Expedia was only passing their cost of the change along.  Then they tried to sell me land in Florida. Considering that most of us have an airline we would prefer to travel with, and tickets are very easily purchased on line  directly from that airline: that if the need should arise to change plans as they all to often do dealing with that airline is going to be so much more simple and cost effective I would personally never deal with any booking agency again; but in particular this one. Please be smarter than me, and most of the others that have left a comment here just say no thanks Expedia, and safe travels.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive

When I was about to leave the Galapagos, LAN charged me ANOTHER $168 to leave because Expedia sold me a ticket that was only for Ecuadorian citizens.  LAN's tickets clearly say on their website that the tickets at that price are only for Ecuadorian citizens, but NO WHERE on Expedia's site when buying the tickets does it say that only Ecuadorian's can buy them.  Therefore I was stranded and had to PAY DOUBLE to leave.  I could not afford to go at the more expensive price and would have not have gone if I had known.  Expedia will not help me out at all and claims it is an ""additional fee"" from the airline, however Expedia sold and American citizen, unknown to me, a ticket only Ecuadorian's can buy and I had to pay out of pocket.

1226	            I was going to Sydney Australia for a work assignment for 6 weeks from 11/29/2015 - 1/13/2016. Since I was going to be gone for the holidays I thought it would be nice to fly my fiancé to Sydney so we could spend New Year’s together. Days later my trip was postponed due to international work visa delays and the issues going on in the world. My work assignment was postponed until further notice. I did not know exactly when and if I was going at all. So I called Expedia to cancel my fiancés flights. These were not cheap flights. Total without tax was $3,143.70. I called on Thanksgiving Day to cancel and spoke to an Expedia agent. Before cancelling the flights with him I stated several times that I wanted a refund. He said yes no problem and that I could ignore the credit voucher email that my fiancé would be receiving. I said are you sure and he said yes no problem. I told him several times that it is a lot of money and that I need it back on my CC. He then said yes I would see a credit voucher email but it could be ignored. We then waited a week and no refund came. I called back and spent 2 hours on the phone for them to tell me it was nonrefundable flight(s) and that I have a credit vouchers now. This was not what I was told so they said they were going to call the corporate office and get the call recording. Expedia said I would receive an email within the next 7-10 business days. No email came so I called once again and another hour spent on the phone. They said that I was informed of the nonrefundable plane tickets on the call recording. Ashley was the agent from the call recording but the funny thing is that I didn't speak to a female when I called to cancel I spoke to a male named (Josh or Joshua). Then I spoke to someone from corporate and when I asked for someone above the agent I was speaking with they told me it was going to be 6 weeks for a call back from someone higher up at Expedia. It is unbelievable that a company as big as Expedia can and will do that to someone.

We purchased the same travel insurance on all three trips and when we called they told us that only one of our three trips was refundable and the other two were non refundable and the insurance would only cover in case of Sickness, Injury or death.  We purchased the same travel insurance on all three trips so how come one trip is refundable and the other two are not?What is the point of paying a significant amount of money on a travel insurance if is NOT going to cover what is supposed to?Piece of advice...be very careful when purchasing vacation packages or plane tickets from expedia and their so called travel insurance....they will change the policies to their convenience making you loose your money.Please pass it around and do not let it also happen to you.

1229	            rented a car with  my plane ticket. When  I arrived in Las Vegas to pick it up I was told I had to buy insurance, not a choice, car was paid for so cold not cancel. Was not told this when I rented it on Expedia. Cheapest rate was $40 per day (was their 16 day's to visit national parks) When I returned the car asked to speak to manager , I explained the situation, he told me he would look into it and contact me, he never did and simply added $622 on my credit card. Explained this situation to Expedia when they asked to evaluate the trip never received any comments from them. Have been usin Expedia for years but never again and will share this with meetup groups and fellow travellers        	                2	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive
1230	            booked flight and car package on the phone with a representative. the other companies notify the day of the flight about on time arrival, etc. expedia did not. no real price guarantee if price is lowered, as one finds with orbitz. did not send email confirmations of order and it took several calls to straighten out the email address!! they completely botched the car rental order and put in for a smaller car than requested. this in spite of the fact that we called subsequently to ensure that we were to get what we ordered. i would not use expedia again.        	                4	1	Friday	expedia	neutral
1231	            booked an apartment in London through Expedia in august of 2015.me,my husband and our 2 kids under age 13. got to London on a late flight,heading towards our apartment at 1am in the morning. after trying to ring the bell for 20 min,we were not let in the building,after making us wait for 45 min outside,I tried to talk to the manager of the building by phone, and she told me that we have NO reservation with them!!!!!! shocked from the news we heard,tiered from our journey,we had no choice but to hop on a London cab and try to find another hotel stay in.which was not an easy task I can tell you! we finally found an hotel triple the price of our apartment and had no choice but to take it! the irony is that up until last minute Expedia was sending us e-mails confirming our checking day and even asking us how we enjoyed our stay at those Landmark apartments...hysterical isn't it? I will never book anything through Expedia again and certainly DO NOT recommend them!!!        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
1232	"            Tried booking a flight online, it would not process any payments however my card kept showing pending authorizations. Called customer service to try and complete booking over the phone instead. Was told that the reason my payment wouldn't process was because I was booking a round-trip flight with frontier one way and another airline for the way back. I was told that Frontier ""does not allow"" round-trip flights to be booked unless you fly frontier both ways. NEWS TO ME!!!!! Not only have I NEVER EVER heard this, I don't understand why your website would let me create itineraries that include frontier as well as other airlines and not notify me anywhere that I must book frontier both ways. Why even give me a selection of airlines?? Not only that I got no explanation when my payment would not go through. I just got kicked back to the payment page every time. But that's not even it. I refused to accept that as an answer and tried to explain to the rep that the problem was clearly their site because I even tried to book a single one way ticket and still my payment would not process fully, with no explanation why. I asked to speak to a supervisor who only repeated the same thing about frontier not allowing you to book a round-trip unless you booked frontier both legs. She wouldn't even acknowledge the fact that my payment wouldn't process when I tried to book a single one way ticket. Over 40 minutes on the phone with customer service, and in the end I booked my flights individually through both the Frontier website and the aa website quicker than they were able to come up with a solution for me. Ridiculous experience, your reps need an education or your website needs an overhaul.        "	                1	2	Monday	expedia	positive
1233	"            I have recently attempted to book combined hotel and return flights from Sydney to Amsterdam. Twice, late on 26 November 2015, I booked and submitted our credit card details via their website and thought it was all booked - twice, for some unknown reason, it failed. The total price quoted was $4,429.79.The next afternoon I booked it all over again online. The total price was now $4,488.17. This time it failed before we submitted our credit card details. It said ""sorry"" and told us to try again.We then phoned Expedia and spoke to ""Usha"". We went through the whole process with her - same hotel, same flights, same dates, etc. She quoted a price of over $9,600, and told us the prices were variable. She told me that she could understand my anger and frustration, but this was the current price. We asked her how, when the online price was currently showing as $4,488.17, she could quote a price of over $9,600, an increase of over $5,000 !! My husband asked her if it cost over $5,000 more to book by phone ! She didn't see any problem with what she quoted - she neither comprehended nor cared!.If this is the best that Expedia can do then I am not interested in booking through them. Not all their employees are this stupid!They don't even deserve 1 star - if there was the option of awarding zero stars, then that is what they would get!I reviewed Expedia on 27 November 2015.  This is the response I received from Expedia, plus my response to that!CommentsExpediaExpedia OfficialHi Kate, we understand your frustration because of the recent booking attempt which was unsuccessful and apologize for the inconvenience caused. Package offers are subject to availability from the suppliers and may change without notice due to volatile nature of availability. We always strive to deliver the best service to our customers and sorry for the experience that you’ve had. We will definitely share the feedback with our customer service team. Regards, Expedia Support.Expedia posted on Nov 27, 2015Kate -That really is a very inadequate response - a more than $5000 increase on an earlier quote, AND on a current online quote, is ridiculous! If you think that ""Usha"" was striving to deliver the best possible service to customers then you have absolutely no idea of the level of anger, disbelief and frustration she caused us. She lost business for you and infuriated us, and if she has done it to us then she has done it to other potential customers! That is nowhere near acceptable customer service - you are failing to deliver anywhere near acceptable customer service.Our experience was not only dreadful, it was incompetent and unintelligent! Anyone with even half a brain should be able to work out that 2 return economy flights from Sydney to Amsterdam, plus 3 night's accommodation cannot cost anywhere near $9,600 !!!Expedia needs to get rid of the 'dead wood' that it obviously employs - as long as you keep them there you will maintain your very bad reputation, and they will damage your business. I did not know about all the dreadful reviews you have received until I felt compelled to write one myself.Kate posted on Nov 28, 2015        "	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative
1234	            Tried to reserved 3 plane tickets for my boss to fly first class, the site wouldn't take the payment so I called. The customer representative told me that adding a package deal will give me a better deal and it was going to be cheaper by $400. Guess what? it was cheaper, but it was domestic. I tried to confirm I wanted first class 5 to 7 times and I always got a 'yes' for an answer. Never got the first class seats I needed and worst of all they took $1,100 from the debit card and told me I had to wait 3 days to get my money back. Now I want to get the actual seats I need, but I can't because it maxes out the card I was using; this stupid mistake added $1,500 more to the card and can't do anything for 3 days.I will never use expedia ever again in my life.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative
1235	"            They were giving out great deals for rio de genairo, Brazil for a few weeks away. Book a trip. Find out after booking that Brazil requires a Visa! Which they failed to mention. And You can't get a Brazilian visa within 5 weeks. Not even expedited. Then they tell you how the trip is non refundable and how it's ""not their job"" to tell you you need a visa. So, basically, they reel in people with these cheap deal trips that they know people can't actually go on. And then they tell you you can't have money your back, and then probably book another poor unfortunately soul in the same seat you already paid for! The customer service was the absolute WORST too. Spent about 15 minutes talking to actual people and over 2 hours on hold. Every time they'd try to connect me to a supervisor something would ""go wrong"" and we would ""lose each other."" And then two days after I had this argument with them, I get another email about all the ""great rio de genairo trips"" they have to offer. Beware of Expedia. I travel every 1-2 months somewhere, and never experienced something like this before!        "	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
1236	            We had booked a hotel for rio. The flight got cancelled so we change destinations. Not only did I spend most of time on hold with Expedia, everyone's responses was always expedia can't do anything. They did not even offer a partial refund. Just rude customer service with absolutely no help and endless transfers. After that we booked a hotel in canada the same day, which they did not offer to transfer fund or anything. We needed to add another day to the hotel. Again I spent most of my time on hold and being transferred. Then they came up with the same beautiful response expedia can't do anything. So now I am sleeping at the airport because expedia has to be the worst company out there with the worst customer service. I will never use expedia again. I don't recommend anyone use it. God forbid anything happens, you are completely on your own expedia will not help at all. Sorry one more thing, on their site they advertise that you  can cancel or make changes without any complications, so expedia what's going on here?        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
1237	            I HAVE SPENT A TOTAL OF 3 HOURS ON THE PHONE TODAY WITH EXPEDIA'S, SO CALLED, MANAGERS AND HAVE CURRENTLY BEEN WAITING 2 HOURS FOR A CALL BACK. THEY ARE TRULY THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL COMPANY TO DO BUSINESS WITH. THERE WAS A NAME ERROR ON THE PASSENGER OF OUR DAUGHTER'S PLANE TICKET HOME FROM COLLEGE. SOMEHOW OR OTHER THE NAME ON THE CREDIT WE USED TO PAY FOR THE TICKET ( WHICH IS MY WIFES NAME) WAS USED AS THE TRAVELING PASSENGER.  AFTER WAITING ON HOLD FOR 45 MINUTES I WAS TOLD BY AN EXPEDIA MANAGER THEY COULD MAKE THE NAME CHANGE BECUASE IT WAS THE FIRST NAME BEING MODIFIED. HE THEN TOOK ALL OF INFORMATION, MY DAUGHTER'S NAME, DATE OF BIRTH AND ASSURED ME THE CHANGE WOULD BE MADE AND I WOULD RECEIVE A CONFIRMATION EMAIL. AFTER TWO HOURS I REALIZED I HAD NOT RECEIVED THE CONFIRMATION EMAIL, SO I CALLED BACK ONLY TO BE PLACED ON HOLD FOR ANOTHER 49 MINUTES BY A MANAGER NAMED REBECCA WHO RUDELY TOLD ME THERE IS NOTHING EXPEDIA CAN DO ABOUT A NAME ERROR AND IT WASN'T THEIR MISTAKE BUT MINE AND I SHOULD HAVE NOTICED IT SOONER.  WHO ARE YOU HIRING EXPEDIA? INCOMPETENT RUDE PEOPLE IS WHAT I EXPERIENCED TODAY. THE MOST INTERESTING PART OF THE ENTIRE SITUATION IS EXPEDIA WILL TELL YOU THAT ITS AMERICAN OR THE  AIRLINE WHO WILL NOT ALLOW THE NAME CHANGE BUT IN ACTUALITY EXPEDIA OWNS THAT CAPABILITY BUT REFUSES TO DO WHAT'S  RIGHT FOR THE CUSTOMER, EVEN WHEN THEY ARE AT FAULT. PATHETIC IS WHAT COMES TO MIND NOW WHEN ASKED ABOUT EXPEDIA. AND BY THE WAY I CALLED AMERICAN AIRLINES AND GUESS WHAT, THEY DID THE RIGHT THING FOR CUSTOMER AND MADE THE NAME CHANGE.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
1238	            Booked our Adelaide hotel through Expedia online, paid upfront. Had to change dates due to family emergency. Spoke to Expedia who then spoke to hotel and dates were changed. Asked Expedia for a confirmation for new dates. Was informed that hotel has to provide the confirmation. Called hotel and received confirmation for new dates. Drove 9 hours to the hotel and was told no such booking existed even though I had a confirmation email. Apparently hotel said they realised after sending me the confirmation email that they didn't have a room for those dates. Hotel emailed Expedia straight away but Expedia did not bother to inform us!! The hotel managed to put us up for 1 night (even though we paid for two) &amp; found us another hotel 4 hours drive away for our second night (which we obviously had to pay for) as all Adelaide hotels &amp; surrounds were fully booked out.Never again will we use Expedia.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	neutral

1240	            I booked a Bahamas Hotel reservation through Expedia that I needed to cancel shortly thereafter (was promised I would be able to cancel at no extra charge).The cancellation process was pure HELL.  First off, the hotel charged the full amount instead of the deposit as promised.  Expedia was supposed to help me with this but 3 times I phoned in and 3 times they could not assist.  When I finally decided to cancel, I had to phone into Expedia on 6 separate occasions - each time had to restart from the beginning as clearly no one was taking notes - each time asked them to contact the hotel to begin the refund processing.  They indicated that they would do so and give me a call back within 24 hours to confirm.  At no point did anyone ever call me back and as a result the refund was not processed.  My 6th and final time phoning in, I stayed on the phone with the individual until they got a hold of the hotel and processed the refund.  This was a 2 hour wait.  When the refund came through, I am short $200CDN and Expedia will provide me NO assistance.  They have told me I need to go direct to the hotel to work out the discrepancy (I am also trying to work with the hotel) but how as a travel provider that I booked the hotel through do you pass me off with no help?  I believe the discrepancy is a direct result of fluctuating exchange rates - which, if at the original time of my request had been processed, I would not have to deal with.  I will NEVER EVER use Expedia again for my bookings (and I travel very frequently) - I will also recommend to all of my friends, family and network to never use them again either.        	                2	1	Monday	expedia	neutral
1241	"            Do not book with Expedia/Trivago!!!!!!(same company). I am still owed a refund from August because of a fault on their part. This is my experience with them:I searched for accommodation for 7th-8th August 2015 on Trivago, checking several times that I had searched the correct dates. Chose to book Eden house in Key West. After having driven the 4 hour drive to key west from Miami we went to check in to the hotel. We then were told that we were booked in for the 28th August 2015! The lady who worked at the hotel said that this has happened before and that if the hotel is not available sites such as trivago change the date to one that is available. Eden house were fully booked and so we were unable to stay at the hotel. The lady checked for other hotels for us but there were none available under 350 dollars as it was a special festival weekend and the ones that were available were at the other side of the island. I tried to ring trivago and was put on hold and then when I thought the phone was being answered it hung up on me (that's 8 minutes of call to an American number from a UK phone charging over £1 a minute) I then rang the complaints line and got through to someone after a few minutes but was told I had come through to the wrong number so then got put on hold again. When the phone was finally answered the lady clearly didn't understand what had happened and to my frustration as she just said let me see if I can cancel this for you oh yes I can cancel it without a fee because you are not booked in until the 28th!!!!!! She didn't understand (as she couldn't speak very good English) that it was their fault not mine! I asked to speak to her manager and I was put on hold again and I chose to put the phone down after 20 minutes as it was costing me a fortune. We then decided to drive back up the keys and try to find a hotel on one of the other islands and at 10.30pm and after trying about 15 hotels we finally found a motel with a vacancy! I gave up trying to get a refund while in the states but my mum kindly rang from home and managed to arrange for someone from Expedia to contact the hotel. Several weeks later I received an email from Expedia advising me that they had contacted the hotel and that I needed to call them so that they could process the refund. I explained that it would cost me a fortune and that I would like to be put through to a manager. Instead of dealing with one person, I had emails coming through from several different people one explaining that they needed to contact the hotel before being able to promise a refund. I was so frustrated because they had already contacted the hotel!!!!! They had clearly not looked at the string of emails prior to this one. It was clear that no one understood what I was saying and that they were clearly filling in a template of standard phrases. I felt hopeless and worried that if I did ring this number it would not only cost me a fortune but I would be put through to someone who would tell me something different and that it would never get sorted. So finally I plucked up the courage to ring them.. The guy was very helpful, however, he said he needed to contact the hotel! What a surprise. He said that if he call was terminated for any reason then he would ring me back. I asked if he could call me any way as it was costing me such a lot of money to which he replied that calls to Expedia are free.... He contacted the hotel, put me on hold several times and eventually he managed to arrange a refund. I then asked if there was anyone I could contact to complain as I felt I deserved compensation for the cost of my phone calls and for the hassle it had caused me. He put me through to his supervisor who was useless. By this time I had been on the phone over an hour. I managed to find an address on the Internet which I am currently in the process of writing to. I received my phone bill and the phone call (that was ""free"") cost me over £60. Oh and to top it off - it's been two and a half weeks and the refund still has not come into my account! So now I am short of $265 dollars for the hotel and about £90 through phone calls. If I do not get a response from them after I write I will take court action. I have looked on the Internet and so many people have had problems with them! One simple message NEVER EVER BOOK WITH EXPEDIA/TRIVAGO.        "	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	neutral

1243	"            Hello everyone. I got a fabulous story with Expedia and here it is.I bought my return ticket in September then I need to change my first trip one day earlier, from 26th Nov to 25th Nov. I called the customer service and it took 90 minutes until they found a seat for me. They asked for 550 dollars for that change and I used my new credit card to pay for it. They asked me if I wanted to pay with the same card as I used in September and I repeated loud and clear, I NEED TO USE MY NEW CARD AND HERE ARE THE DETAILS. After that they accepted it a nd said there is no problem, all done, have a good trip. When I arrived the airport yesterday, Quantas did not allow me boarding as something wrong with my ticket. I called Expedia 10 times, spent 8 hours in total to talk to ""supervisors"" in India, Canada, US, and eventually I found out what happened. 1: Expedia still used my old invalid credit card for the payment.2: Expedia said they may try to contact me through email or telephone. I received nothing and I have all evidences to prove it. What's even more funny, they send me a email to remind me I got a problem with my credit card AFTER I FINISHED MY TELEPHONE COMPLAINANT. I called them right after that, they said WE SENT YOU AN EMAIL BUT YOU DID NOT SEE IT. That's pathetic, or, actually that's childish. 3: Expedia CANCELLED! CANCELLED! CANCELLED! both my 1st and 2nd trip before they confirmed the new ticket. So they pretty much FORCED ME TO DOUBLE PAY to get a new ticket even if I want to travel on the same date as I ordered in September. I don't know how this mysterious Expedia work, but when they asked to wait on the phone for processing my credit card, which took me 15 minutes, I supposed Expedia works like every other company I know, and they would inform me there is a problem rather than saying ""no problem, all done"".4: Even more ridiculous, here is the best part, although I 'did not pay‘ for the trip change (550), the itinerary in their system showed my first flight departed on 25th Nov, which is yesterday, because of that, Expedia CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE FLIGHT HAS EXPIRED. I asked to talk those ’supervisors' again, they said they will call me ABSOLUTELY at 7 am just make sure I can travel today. No one called, and I called them again, they said the supervisors will call me in 20 minutes. 45 minutes has past. I know nothing about business. But I suppose the truth is Expedia is such a pathetic company which does not take any responsibility or risk, THEY WILL CANCEL ALL YOUR TICKETS FIRST AND NO ONE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE IN CASE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE NEW TICKET. During these 8 hours, I heard ’I understand what you say' for 45 times, 'It is the rule from airline' for 28 times, 'Nothing I can do about it' for 20 times. Trust me public travellers, if you want to change your ticket, think about it again. Now I am writing letters to Fair trading, newspaper, and my lawyer. The customer service suggest me DO WHAT I WANT AS A CUSTOMER. So let's do it. Trust me, I have more time and energy than you think. This complaint will soon appear on every review webpage.Case complaint number: S-114778180.Name of the agent promised everything is done: JohnSupervisor: Khaleel        "	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

1245	            Expedia’s customer service is incompetent. TLDR: flight time gets changed 3 months in advance of travel; Expedia denies my original flight time; no solution for 2 months; called a liar. Booked a flight 3 months ago and received notice 2 weeks later that the flight had been changed to 3 hours later. When I checked with the airline, they said they did not change the flight. I called expedia no less than 5 times in the past 2 months wondering why and was told they would call be back within 48 hours. They never called me. I made it clear I needed some conclusion so I could make my own arrangements, but was left hanging. The most recent interaction with their “escalations” team has insinuated that I am a liar and the revised time was always correct. They seem to ignore the fact I have the original email confirmation. I suppose i am now a forger as well. Any advice on how to further raise this? The team led by the incompetent Vinod Kumar and the 4 duty managers before him I spoke with are worthless.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

I made reservation for a room at The Hotel at Times Square for 10/10-12 and I received a confirmation email  stating that “Your reservation is confirmed. No need to call to reconfirm.” Nevertheless, we called the hotel around 11:30pm the day before the trip to just make sure. To our total surprise the hotel said they did not receive any information from expedia regarding this reservation. We then called the expedia customer service right away and they were not able to get us a room at that hotel. It took 5 hours for expedia to get another room for us near the Time Square. We are extremely disappointed by the experience. It costed us a whole night of sleep and caused much stress. How could we trust any booking from expedia again when a confirmed reservation is not guaranteed?We wrote to expedia customer service after the trip, but never got any response to our complaint.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative
1254	            Attempted to book a holiday with Expedia. Was advised that due to a 'system error' my payment could not go through and no booking could be made. No booking reference ever received. Then only minutes later go into my account to find I have been charged 3 x Booking fees and a partial amount for the holiday I never received. Total $1745.20Criminal acts being completed by people working for Expedia. Caution do not use        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	neutral
1255	            I have stayed at Movenpick Sentosa several times before in the past and this time I booked via AirAsia through Expedia and to my surprise that it does not include breakfast even though I paid much higher fee this time around compared to the past. So if you book direct with the Hotel it's cheaper and provides breakfast.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	neutral

1257	            BEWARE Expedia NO LONGER RELIABLE SITE I confirmed hotel reservation -arrived at hotel  reservation has been canceled. Called Expedia spoke with four agents finally one found my reservation and said I had canceled by me. Impossible I was in the outback of Australia with no Internet service. Not only did they charge my credit card and confirm the reservation but charged an additional $300 cancelation fee.  I was told this would be looked into and I would have some answers within 72 hours . I have to pay for the hotel all over again. Expedia is no longer a reliable booking site.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative
1258	            I wish I would have checked out this review website first before making a booking on Expedia. It was my first time using them, and believe me, I'd rather pay more for a professional travel agent than using Expedia ever again in my life !!Their website is constantly down, bookings can't be made - repeated error messages. So called them to make a simple booking - it took 75 minutes to complete that booking - the person was THE most incompetent person I have ever encountered in my life ! Guess what - of course the booking details were wrong, he totally messed things up, including my name. Call their customer service hotline ? The biggest joke ever - have to wait 3 hours and 25 minutes for your turn - but after 1 hour the system kicks you out lol. The mistake they made - which they do admit - but they won't help you fix the problem, you will have to fix it yourself. It's hilarious. So so much hassle and stress for absolutely nothing.People, book directly, use a travel agent - whatever the case, don't use Expedia, ain't worth is seriously !        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
1259	"            I will never use Expedia again. My booking was supposed to include breakfast but it hotel denied so I rang Expedia and they told me to pay for it and they will refund once I send them receipts, I thought this was good customer service at first until 5 phone calls and 20 emails later still no refund or response but continued ""escalations"" which really means a way to get rid of you for a few more days. I am $150 out of pocket (I would never have bought that breakfast if it wasn't being refunded) and very disgruntled. DO NOT BOOK ANYTHING THROUGH EXPEDIA.

1260	            NOT worth ONE star! If I could choose ZERO stars I would have! This was the worst experience EVER! They SUCK! It's worth the extra dollars to deal with airlines directly! And I wouldn't recommend United!! We are frequent travelers- WE WILL NEVER USE EXPEDIA AGAIN and will be sure to spread our reviews to friend, family, colleagues, and social media!        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
1261	            I Really think if a company is going to advertise $10 hotels, they should at least put some on the App to show that there was some, at this point i don't believe that there was one on offer!!!!  I have booked many thing through Expedia in the past and from this minute on you have lost a customer. I don't think there is anything as horrible as a company taking their customers for a ride.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1262	            What an asshat company. I had a flight cancel, which Expedia didn't tell me about, got put on a different flight, and had a 5 hour layover in the beautiful (NOT) metropolis of Detroit. Never again. They are a rip. Dealing with the airline direct is cheaper.        	                2	1	Monday	expedia	neutral
1263	            I received an email from Expedia to advise that there had been a signicant change made to a specific route of my trip to Europe. The email read that I had been contacted several times before via email and contact number with no response....NOT TRUE....nothing in my junk mail and no missed call on my phone. It continued to say that this would be the last time I would be contacted and that my options were limited. So I called the number provided immediately....needless to say that they could not help me but generated another case Case ID and advised that I would be contacted witching 72 hours. No such thing so I called again same story, another Case ID and and another promise that someone would contact me in 72 hours. 72 hours passed, no call, so the same scenario repeated a third time. What sort of service is this, why provide a phone number that the operator can not assist you with the problem for one, when asked for another number that I could call, I was advised that this was not possible. I asked to speak to a Supervisor and was advised they were too busy! Very dissapointing Expedia, I have always used you in the past, no issues because there has not been any issues with the booking I guess, but lesson learnt and will not use you in the future regardless of how cheap your fares are. Not sure how this will end!        	                3	1	Saturday	expedia	negative
1264	            I'm happy with the number of bookings I've done with expedia. Clear process of booking with good ability to check itineraries after. As well as decent email notification and mobile app support. The points program is a plus as well.I have had limited need to phone them, but no problem when I did.The prices and availability of flights and hotels can sometimes be subpar. That would be my main criticism.        	                2	4	Thursday	expedia	negative
1265	            I have never in my life received as poor of service as I have from this company. I have spent at least 9 hrs on the phone, been disconnected several times, transferred to many to even count and after 3 weeks of this I still have to resolve the issue that they are holding $6800 of my money. They promised resolution over a week ago and after finally getting to talk to a corporate representative last week I was promised resolution by yesterday. I am now on hold for going on half hour now and not one person knows what I am talking about even with my ticket number        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive
1266	            I've spoken to possibly at least 10customer service agents for the last 8 hours and still unresolved. I was trying to book my airline credit from past trip approaching expiration. I've been transferred from expedia to united and back and forth to no avail. Agents and supervisors are damn rude and don't know sh**!They'll put you on hold for so long, and won't even call you back after you've given your # and made it clear that if it gets disconnected to call you back. But nope! They don't give a s***! so then you dial expedia again and  you have to start your case all over again! If it's booking a reservation sure they'll be more than happy to assist you but for other things? To my great disappointment, I cried! I couldn't believe it. I felt robbed. I felt helpless. When in fact, I'm just trying to use A service I already paid for.I hope the higher ups of expedia gets to read this and fix this! From now on, no more expedia booking from me or frommy family or to anyone I know. My story will be heard.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	positive
1267	            I just spent THREE hours on the phone, talking to four different representatives.The worst of all, the Manager of Customer Service, Craig. Ridiculous attitude and he definitely did not provide any customer service. It is crazy how these people all they know how to do is take your money, but when it's an emergency they don't give any money back!Definitely not choosing Expedia again and i'll make sure to let all of my friends and family know.Not that they will care, considering all the money they make from innocent people, but they will certainly also disregard my comment.I truly wish there was somebody who would honestly take this review into consideration and take care of situations like that!

1268	            Do not call Expedia when booking reservations!

I've now been on the phone with them twice, for close to an hour.... in this time, I've been told I can't do the option they told me in an email I had, I've been disconnected when asked to speak to a supervisor, and have spoken with customer service people with no idea what they're doing.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	neutral
1271	"            I attempted to book a flight and car with Expedia.  I logged on - found the air travel i wanted - and added my car.  I Got a good price - thinking wow This is great. Only to find out that i would guess that Expedia does not really have any travel deals to actually share with the consumers!.  I got to the payment part.  Put my info in --- my credit card. Only i had to do this about 15 - 20 times.  Every time i put my code in the website informed me that the price had changed and my 'code' needed to be corrected.  Well my code was fine.  It was Expedia's rotten website that could not seem to work.  It actually gave me two itinerary numbers - actually three - i attempted this  three separate times -took about three hours.  When it actually looked like it may have taken my information -the website popped up and said ""Your price has changed call the C.S. line""  So i did this --spent another 30 minutes only to be told that I did not have any reservations at all and that i should go to the airline's website to book my travel.  So i tried it again in the morning. Again - did not work so i thought well i will call. certainly an agent can get it to go through.  Stupid me. and an hour of my cell phone minutes. Then after being transferred to 4 agents - and the entire hour of my time -- I was told -the flight is no longer available.  WHAT T.H.!!!!.I went into another computer and found another website and booked the same flight -- unfortunally the car cost me 200.00 more dollars.DO NOT USE EXPEDIA!!!! THEY ARE THE WORST EVER!!!There is actually one other site that did the same thing.   How they stay in business is beyond me.  hope consumers find this helpful in travel bookings.

1272	            My husband and I booked our flights for our honeymoon through Expedia. Our flight was booked for 9:30am. We arrived at the airport at 7:30am, was told by Jet Blue that the flight they booked us for did not exist and that our flight was actually at 630am (you know, an hour before we even got to the airport) JetBlue said that they had contacted Expedia 4 times to notify of the flight change, but Expedia did not notify us (though they claim they did - trust me, I've searched everywhere in my email that I had set up ONLY for wedding stuff - it's not in there!) JetBlue did everything they could and got us to San Juan, while Expedia left us on hold. However, due to this error, we missed the ENTIRE FIRST DAY OF OUR HONEYMOON. OUR HONEEEEEEEEYMOOOOOOOOOOOON.

1274	"            Having booked with Expedia with no problems before, I booked flights for my wife and I to Marseille.  3 days after making my booking, I noticed that my bank account was over £600 less than it should have been.  After checking with the bank, they told me that the amount was ""on hold"" for British Airways (with whom we'd booked our flights via Expedia.)  After many fruitless calls to BA, they asked me to call Expedia as my booking was with them.It transpired that Expedia ask for the whole booking fee to be made available to them for 7 days!  Even when the airline has been paid by the bank, they continue to hold the cost of your trip until the 7 days have passed when they return it to your account.They claim this is to ""safeguard"" your booking with the airline, but this is not publicised on their website anywhere.  The banks hate it as it causes more work for them, and as a customer it could prove embarrassing if you go to spend money on your account which Expedia is ""holding"" for you and is therefore unavailable to you!I'm still waiting for the money that I've already paid to BA, to be refunded to my account from Expedia before I can use it!!Annoying - Very.  Unethical - Undoubtedly.  Underhand - Absolutely.Expedia's response ""We're sorry your disappointed in our level of service, however you will get your funds returned to your account in a few days.""

1280	            I had used Expedia several times before, over the course of many years and was a happy customer. However, on my last trip my flight got cancelled and I was sent a generic email in the middle of the night requesting I contact them for assistance. I had to call these people four different times, and spend a total of 3 hours on the phone just to book my return trip home. There inability to gather key information that would enable me to book the most conveneint trip back home, consistently placing my on hold, two of the representatives failed to call back where one said he would and the other the call dropped (so you would think someone one call back, right?), me having to repeat myself over and over again. It was a nightmare. But the most horrific thing is the fact that I had to pay a nearly $600 cell phone bill because of this all. I am so upset and disappointed. My trip was a slight bust in and of itself for other reasons, but Expedia has now made it a complete fail. PLUS, i sent them an email requesting a call back to discuss my experience and a full 7 days have passed and not a word. Priceline anyone?        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

I waited in a crowed hotel lobby for over an hour, waiting for your incompetent hotel customer service to figure out my reservation on the phone , figuring out how to use a fax machine and then hanging up on me three times after asking to speak to a manager.  I booked my room- paid  in full.  You offer no cancellation on the reservation, which the girls could not locate. And yet your customer service was subpar and left me stranded in a overbooked hotel with no room.

I applied for the best price guarantee and had a really hard time even getting a response. Kept getting told misinformation and transfered where I would have to start all over and repeat everything , just to find out the phone reps can't contact anyone on the best price guarantee team and that I have to email them to check the status. Wasted hours talking to reps that could have told me that in the first place. Finally received a denial I didn't agree with 3 months later. Tried one last time to give expedia the chance to make it right. Either by applying some sort of discount to a future reservation or hotel addition, or if not possible, even being understanding with common decency for my bad experience. But again both rep and supervisor were extremely rude and non apologetic for the whole process, which could have been avoided in the first place if I was given the right information.

1283	            I would like to share our horrible experience staying at Living Rome (a B&amp;B place we booked through our Expedia Travel Agent) last October 3-8, 2015. After our Cosmos Land Tour, my husband and I decided to stay an extra 4 days in Rome to be able to see the historic sites we have missed our during the tour.We booked our accommodations through our Expedia Travel Agent who also booked our land tour. We thought that since we booked our accommodations through Expedia, we will not have any problem. After all, they have a name.  We were wrong!  Our stay in Living Rome turned out to be a nightmare from the start.  After our tour ended, we took a cab to the address given in our confirmation letter by our travel agent. When we reached the location, the building looked decent but when we entered there was no name of Living Rome in the list of occupants in the building.  The Bed and Breakfast in that location was Home@Rome which is a legitimate operation on the 3rd floor of the building.  My husband tried to call the phone no. in the confirmation letter and it was out of service so he went to the address also given in the confirmation letter to pick up our keys.  But when he got there, the unit in the confirmation letter was rented out to someone else and they were not aware of the Living Rome.  So he went back to the building we were dropped off (where I was waiting), the Manager of Home@Rome came down.  She informed us that Living Rome was not located in their building and that they have been using their address and their pictures deceiving people about theiractual accommodations.  She said that they have reported Living Rome to the police since Living Rome has been giving their address to their clients and when they get there, they will ask their clients to walk a few blocks down to their actual location which is dingy, stinking room in the basement. She even had to call the owner of Living Rome to inform him that we were waiting in their building.Not only was the room dingy and stinking, their bathroom was not even working properly. The shower and the toilet seats were broken, the water closet was not even functioning as it should and the shower did not even have a soap dish to put your soap in.  Since the room was at the basement and at the ground level, the room smelled like sewer.  Their bathroom window did not even have curtains to block from being seen from the outside so when you shower you could be easily be seen from the outside.  And they did not even change the towels or clean the bathroom daily.  It came to a point where we had to leave a tip twice just to clean our bathroom and get fresh towels, but they would just change our towels leave and not even clean our bathroom! It was so disgusting at how dirty it was that I had to clean our bathroom twice. I was supposed to be on vacation, yet I had to clean our bathroom coz it was not being cleaned. Then during our last night, they cut the internet so we did not have internet at all. And they even changed our coffee machine to one that did not work at all so we could not use it to make coffee for our final morning in Rome.  What was worst, on our last night, the neighbor from upstairs came knocking at our door asking us to turn off our air conditioner since the noise had kept them awake for the past 4 nights.  It just confirmed that this Living Rome was not a licensed bed and breakfast operation!This was our first trip to Rome so we were not familiar with the place and did not know what to do or where to go. This by far has been the worst accommodation I have ever stayed in my life.  Our stay at Living Rome was a total disaster! I do not know how Expedia could have accredited such an establishment which has been reported to the Police and still recommend it to their clients. I hope that they will remove Living Rome from their list of accredited accommodation so no one else will experience what we had just experienced.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative

It has been 3 weeks now, every chance i get I have to get on the phone with them, they put me on long holds, 2 to 3 hours, they send me from department to department  and they don't return my moneyThis was a big disappointment, I will never give them business again        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	neutral
1287	            After one cancellation month prior when I thought I would receive refund but then found out only would get a credit from airline PLUS have tp pay an additional $200 for change fee WHICH WOULD BE REFUNDED because I bought insurance( makes no sense why I would be charged then refunded for re-booking), I paid for another package with package protection the next month, becauwe this time I askled specifically and the agent said I WOULD RECIEVE MY MONEY BACK FOR EVERYTHING. Boilerplate is contradictory: says you can cancel for any reason, no cancellation fees. Then further down it says airline tickets are NON-REFUNDABLE. Completely dishonest wording...is a marketing ploy. And the agents don't understand it apparently.I don't blame the customer service people: they were actually all pleasant and seemed to feel bad they were put in this position. It is Expedia's mangement that is at fault: they are completely dishonest. The wording is dishonest, and the CS Reps don't entirelly understand it because they have to read the canned information. They have been put in a difficult position.Will never use Expedia again. Scam artist company: all in the management.        	                2	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
1288	"            Just got off the phone with Expedia after 2.5 hours and 2 calls because I was hung up on or I guess somehow disconnected while on hold after the first hour.I have been a loyal Expedia customer for over 5 years now.  I don't even look at other websites because everything has always worked out before.  My husband and I go to Hawaii for a week every year and travel other places using Expedia throughout the year.We are scheduled to fly to Kona on November 2nd and return a week later.  I booked this flight in February.  I have received several emails indicating flight changes on our return flight over the months since booking.  Each time the email states you don't have to do anything Expedia has accepted the changes for you.  Keep in mind I specifically selected which flights and times I wanted to return when I booked my travel as most of us do.  My original flight leaves Kona at 10:30 am flying to Maui and then San Jose and finally home to Reno making a 10 hour day.  The most recent flight they rescheduled me on leaves Kona an hour earlier at 9:20 flies to Maui then to Sacramento then to Seattle then to Reno making a 13 hour day and more lay overs (opportunities for lost luggage).  I called and at first they told me that I would have to call the airlines myself because the changes had been made.  I said no, I made the reservations through you and you accepted the changes on my behalf without asking first so you need to fix it.  The first person I spoke to I did not write down his name because I thought it would be a simple fix (mistake-be sure to write down all information when dealing with these uncooperative ""customer service"" reps).  I was told that he would contact the airlines and see what he could do.  He put me on hold.  He came back twice in the next hour to let me know he was working on it and then the phone went dead the 3rd time he put me on hold.I called back and had to start my story all over again (apparently we don't write notes in the file) this time with Ivona.  I was told then that the flight I was scheduled to be on did not stop in Sacramento.  I told them that the itinerary on my Expedia Account showed it stopping there and a layover.  They were adamant that it was not going to Sacramento.  Ivona went onto the Alaska Airlines webpage to get me a copy of the itinerary that they had with no stops in Sacramento.  I asked her how she explained why Alaska Flight 800 on the itinerary that showed one stop from Maui to Seattle was not stopping in Sacramento or for that matter where was it stopping.  She kept telling me that the 10 hours form Maui to Seattle was a direct flight and if it did stop it was not in Sacramento.  I then was a bit sarcastic and asked where do you suppose it is stopping between Maui and Seattle if there is nothing there.  She was adamant that it was direct even though if you clicked on the link of the document she email me it stated clearly that it was stopping in Sacramento.  For any one not familiar with Sacramento and Reno, they are about a 2 hour drive from each other where Seattle is about 11-12 hours drive from Reno.  So basically I could drive home from Sacramento and be there before the flight I was scheduled on would land.I then asked to speak to her supervisor.  I was tired of her talking over me and her information was not even accurate.After I was on hold again for 30 minutes her supervisor Aubrey (not sure this is a real name since I was talking to a man and I am not sure Aubrey is a man's name).  He too started by talking over me and telling me that this flight did not go through Sacramento.  After he kept interrupting me I asked him where the one stop was between Maui and Seattle,  the ocean and he seriously asked me what ocean.  He and I ended up on the Alaska Airlines webpage together so that he could prove to me that this flight was not longer and did not have an extra stop in Sacramento.  After he explained everything I told him to click on the link for the flight details right next to where it says 1 stop.  I then rudely asked him to read it to me.  He said it was stopping in Sacramento but I would not have to leave the plane, never mind the fact that it is adding time to my day.  Clearly they have forgotten that we pay more to get the flights that we want, not to have our flights  randomly changed.  After he put me on hold again for a long time he said that  I would get a call back within 24 hours because they were requesting a waiver from the airlines to make a change to our flights. I asked what do I need to do if I don't get a call back so he gave me a reference number so that I would not have to start over.  He did however explain that even if are able to change our flights, the airlines may change them all again before we fly home.  I asked him how that works, the only times I have ever had my flights changed all over the place is when I book with Expedia.  When I book direct I get the flight that I chose unless it is weather related or mechanical issues, not just for the sake of changing flights.  He said I did not know what I was talking about because the airlines change up their flights all of the time it is not just Expedia.  I stated that with all of the flying I have done all over the state and country the only huge changes or big issues have been when booking with Expedia.  I was then told that if I am so good at booking with the airlines and I don't like the way Expedia does it them maybe I should not use their services anymore and need to do it on my own.  I then asked Aubrey for his name because I forgot to do that when he first got on the phone and thanked him for the information.  I ended the call with telling him I appreciate getting his name so that I can let the corporate office know that he was of no help and told me not to use Expedia services anymore and I hung up.  Now I just have to see if I hear from anyone at all over the next 24 hours about my return flight.  I guess over all there are worse places to not have a return flight home.

1289	            Booked a hotel with Expedia, not only did they have a $250 hidden charge only mentioned in the confirmation page....  they charged me TWICE for the same room! I contacted Expedia not even ten mins after booking and seeing the double charge, and they stated they would contact my bank of the mistake, when I called my bank they stated they have never spoken to Expedia of the problems. I called my bank via 3way with a Customer service rep from Expedia. The Expedia worker then told my bank they were lying about the charges even though the bank assured them that the money was indeed taken out twice and that the bank themselves flagged the payment. Expedia's customer service was so rude to my bank (while on 3-way) that my bank asked if the conversation could continue without Expedia on the line due to the way they were being spoken to. Needless to say I will NEVER book ANYTHING with Expedia again and now have loads of paperwork to fill out so the bank can fight for my money!

1291	"            My girlfriend was in a bad accident and in critical condition at the hospital. We had a trip to Hawaii coming up and I had booked the flight through Expedia. We cancelled the trip two weeks prior to leaving. Expedia would not issue a refund, only a credit voucher with the airline. Additionally there was going to be a $400 re-booking fee when I went to re-book a flight. I thought this was really messed up due to the circumstances, but things were already super stressful with my girl being hurt so badly, so I didn't fight with them. I have tendency to get really angry when big corporations screw people over, and I wanted as much energy as possible to totally and unconditionally be there for my girl. I knew we'd used the voucher anyway.What was even worse was my girl had a lot of damage done to her body and was going to be disabled for awhile. The doc said a year of physical therapy would be needed and flying was out of the question. Then my mother got sick and I needed to fly back home so I called Expedia to use my voucher and book the flight. I know this sounds like a sob story, but it's what happened! lol. The voucher was for $1109. My ticket back east was $500, so I thought great, my voucher will cover it. However, because one of my tickets was in my girlfriends name, I could only use half the credit which was $554 and then half the re-booking fee, which was $200, which left me with $354. I honestly couldn't afford the extra $200. This was a shocker. No one explained this to me, nor did the email they sent me say this. In fact, the email said - ""Dear Matthew, You have a voucher for $1109"". It didn't even mention my girlfriends name. I was really upset about this. I explained the situation with them and they didn't care. They would do nothing. I talked to a manager named Lusha, who barely spoke English and was rude and then I spoke to another manager named Arturo who spoke English but was extremely rude. He told me it was my responsibility to read all of the terms and conditions when I purchased the ticket. I just couldn't believe that they wouldn't help me. Plus, Expedia is the only company I have used to book travel through for years and I travel a lot for work. I use them to book everything - hotels, vacations, etc. I have been a loyal customer. I was furious that under the circumstances they would not assist. I even gave them the option of just paying for the remainder of my ticket back east - an extra $200 - nope. I asked Arturo to have his manager call me and he told me it would be 7-10 days!!  Wow. This just goes to show that Expedia is just another greedy, evil big corporation, that's so big they don't give a damn about their customers.        "	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1292	            Really bad customer service after I made a mistake with my booking. Even though I contacted them right after the reservations was made and there was almost a year until my journey they wanted to charged me 300€ to change a reservation! If I had booked directly with Iceland Air instead (who I was flying with anyway) it would have only cost me 30€ to do the exact same thing!

1293	            I booked plane tickets and everything was fine. I looked to book hotel and another flight for within Mexico , but decided not to go with them. I found a unauthorized charge on my account when my bank called me and blocked my card. I released the block because I had to still look for a hotel and the other flight and within a couple of days I have 5 unauthorized charges on my account all different amounts totaling over 1200.00. Suppose to be returned within three days and was not and when I went to the bank there were more. I will never use them again and you shouldn't either. Nomatter what price you get.

1294	            We booked our vacation thru expedia because they had the best price at the time. As soon as it was booked and paid, i get an itinerary emailed to me with one day missing for the hotel. We booked 01/06 thru 01/13 and they had the hotel 01/07 thru 01/13. Well the first time i called they said they could book the room for another $440 (which they said that's what the room costed). Then i said i booked the room for 01/06 thru 01/13 for the price that i paid and i dont want to pay more, they said they dont know what happen but can give it to me. I made my husband call later on and they also told him they couldnt do it, when he said cancel the trip they said they would charge us half price for the room and give us $200 off on top of that, he said fine. We still haven't gotten the refund of $200. Then 3 weeks after we book, i get fraudulent charges on my credit card, which i have had this credit card for one year and have never had an issue and we haven't purchased anything else besides this trip in months! I WILL NEVER USE EXPEDIA AND AGAIN AND WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE! Waste of my time and money, and they steal you credit card numbers.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
1295	"            The Expedia Agent explained that we had until December 29th before any charges would be made on the card and until that date, we could cancel with no penalty. Based on this, we booked with the Expedia Agent right then on the phone. The very next day, Monday October 5th I received an alert from my card company stating that $1650.00 had been charged to my card. The Expedia agent apologized and explained that I was told this because Expedia thought that this was the arrangement Expedia had with the hotel. I explained that I wanted Expedia to honor what they told my husband and me as I did not call the hotel, I called Expedia. The Expedia rep told me that it was out of their hands because he contacted the hotel and the policy is to bill 50% now and 50% upon arrival and if I didn't show up, the hotel would bill for the full amount. When I asked to speak with a manager, repeatedly I got put on hold and then disconnected. After 2 days and numerous calls ending in the company hanging up/disconnecting, I finally got in touch with a manager (""Hans"" he said his name was). He apologized for Expedia's misinformation, I knew he was merely telling me anything to get me off the phone, so I cancelled reminding him that I am going by what the Expedia Agent said at the time of booking and I expect a full refund. Today, I took it upon myself to call the Sea Shore Allure hotel myself. The manager, Bridgette answered and stated a different policy (80% if cancelled before 2months of arrival). Also Bridgette said the Expedia rep called but did not cancel. Today, Expedia manager 'Jess' claims she processed the cancellation but regardless of what the lying agent said, I would only get back what the hotel will refund. Which means I'm ripped off for $660.00!!! Contacting the attorney general.        "	                2	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
1296	            I recently booked a ticket via Expedia travel services for a Saturday afternoon form  Johannesburg to Hong Kong (return) with South African Airways, to attend a business meeting the following Monday afternoon. I booked to leave on Saturday and returning on Monday night, as I work Monday to Friday in South Africa and needed to minimize my absence from work to minimize income/business loss. On the day of departure I arrived at the airport and was told the flight has been cancelled due to bad weather in HK. I inquired with the meteorological office in Hong Kong and they stated that there had been bad weather, but not to an extend that airlines couldn't approach, in fact - a competitor airline flew out on that same Saturday. The meteorological service also told me that the weather would have passed by the time of arrival of the flight  in Hong kong, so reasons to cancel the flight were subjective. However, I was given a cancellation confirmation by the airline to be taken back to the travel agent Expedia to organize a reschedule or refund. But when I called the travel agent, they told me that the airline refuses to refund and would only offer rescheduling within 7 days from time of original departure to time of new arrival (therefore with time difference real;ly only 6 days, not 7, which I would need to go out on Saturday and be able to return to Johannesburg on Monday with minimum business interruption.) As I booked and paid via Expedia - my agreement/contract is with them - but it did'nt bother them a bit that there would be no refund for my 6000HKD flight......and I could'nt even take up my fight with the airline directly, since the agreement is legally with Expedia, not South African, who had no interest to rectify the situation. The most ridiculous and unbelievable situation in my many years of air travel that I ever encountered - STAY AWAY FROM EXPEDIA TRAVEL AND STAY AWAY FORM SOUTH AFRICAN AIRWAYS.        	                3	1	Saturday	expedia	negative
1297	            Booked a round trip ticket with American on the Expedia website. When I was reviewing my charges, I was perplexed as to why there were 2 separate charges for the one round trip ticket. Well I found out that the flight was booked by Expedia as 2 separate flights and when I made the decision not to travel into the potential hurricane influence area this weekend I found that there would be not one but two $200 change fees, greater than the ticket price, so I am out $360. An American agent could not understand why Expedia booked it like that, no 3rd party refund, really. In the future I will look at their site then book directly with the airline. Who would catch the significance of a round trip ticket booked like that?        	                2	1	Friday	expedia	positive

1299	            Booked a trip to Cancun with Expedia as I have many times. When we arrived at our Hotel we were told the hotel was on strike and taken to another resort in Playa Del Carmen. The Blue Bay in Playa Del Carmen was infested with mosquitos, Raccoons and Coatis. Raccoons would be running through the halls of this hotel at night as you were trying to turn in. First day there I called Expedia and was on the phone over 4 hrs explaining that booked a trip to Cancun and wanted to be put in a hotel in Cancun. Basically told there was nothing they could do. I could've gone to Cancun and paid an additional 2000.00 USD or stay where I was. Worst Vacation ever. I will never recommend or book with Expedia again. As stated I have been booking with Expedia for years but after how I was treated I will never book with them or their partners again.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
1300	            At the time of my booking I was debating between a few of the travel sites, but decided to go with Expedia before since I have been loyal there for years, have points, and they had a price match guarantee.  I found an exact match on multiple travel sites, both of which were lower than expedia's, and I thoroughly compared all the fine print.  Booked with expedia and submitted my price match, which was advertised to get a response within 48 hours (that was on August 2nd).  I got a response the next day, denying it because they needed more information (and they are incapable of looking it up).  Try to contact the price match department- it doesn't exist.  They do not answer emails, and there is only a general customer service dept.  I tried to be connected to someone specific in that department, who I figured may even have 1/4 of a brain, but alas no luck.  Every tedious and draining call for a price match got me nowhere.  They review mundane details, quote inaccurate sources, and put you on hold for 20minutes at a time to come back with worthless answers.August 4th started my price match rebuttal, and I did not get an answer until September 24th (2 weeks after my trip lol).  What an embarrassment.  Throughout the process, I was given several reasons for why my price match was invalid, all of which proved to them to be incorrect and they agreed, but then nothing changed. A month after the price match was submitted, they told me that they couldn't do it because the prices were out-of-date... Oh that's great- so I am to blame because they look at it a month after it was submitted.  Endless garbage like that all for $150.  Instead they lose a customer and hopefully more.  I sincerely hope no one books with Expedia if you expect to win a price match guarantee.  It doesn't matter how logical or rational your details are, or what evidence you provide.  They will stall or come up with some BS to not validate it.They went from my go-to booking website to being blacklisted.  Atrocious.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive
1301	            Itinerary number: 19697661731My friends and I booked our multi-trip over the phone, as there was 8 of us with multiple flights.  It took an age but thought it best with the number of people involved. We checked all spelling etc but when the booking came through via email, the last letter of my surname was missed off. I rang them to highlight this mistake but was advised it was non refundable and names could not be changed. Instead it would have to be cancelled and rebooked. Meaning I would lose out on my air fares of approx. £700! I immediately notified them that this was an error on their part and have requested the phone recording 3 times, for proof otherwise. Still no cd or promised call backs, despite calling 4 times and emailing a lengthy complaint.  Every time I call, all I get is someone reading from a script and doesn't have the knowledge nor authority to deal with my concerns. The company hasn't even had the decency to acknowledge my complaint, sent last Thursday (24/09).I can not afford to lose £700 because of one your staff's typos.

In March my wife and I had a 1 night break booked for March. Our baby was miscarried sadly so I rescheduled the trip to August 8th 2015. A truly traumatic time and this also cost over £250 to do. The day before flying in August I checked the Itinerary and everything was confirmed. On arrival at Gatwick on 8th August British Airways had a flight for my wife but no record of me at the check in desk despite me showing them the iItinerary and ticket number. BA explained this error happens frequently with Expedia and said I had to buy a ticket if I wanted to fly. I desperately called Expedia and the customer service said it would take too long to investigate but logged my complaint. So I had to pay £527 for a ticket to Venice. The trip was badly tainted by the worry about what had happened. I called Expedia repeatedly on my return. The same India call centre said they would escalate but then I heard nothing. I emailed the bfscrd customer relations complaints department with my scanned in air tickets that I had to pay with BA and the Itineraryschedule. The only acknowledgement from Expedia was a auto responder saying they are experiencing high volumes of emails:""We are currently experiencing an unexpected increase in e-mail requests, preventing us from responding within our normal standards. Be assured that we are working diligently to handle all requests in a timely manner and in the order received."" This has been going on for 50 days now. No one is looking into this for me. IT IS A SCAM!!! Expedia have taken my money for a flight they never provided. I have paid over £1200 for a 1 night stay in Venice. I had to fund the BA flight on my credit card and Expedia owe me the refund but have not even apologised. I find this absolutely disgusting and appalling given we had to pay over £250 to change the flights because our baby died. And then they screw up by not booking me a ticket. They have committed fraud and need to refund my costs immediately as I have not received the service I paid for.

When the confirmation email came through, it said one adult, two children.  I immediately called Expedia to correct the reservation and got put through their outsourcing HQ in the Philippines.  The people who answer the phone there are lacking in basic communication and customer service skills.  They hung up on me mid-sentence.  They would change voices and pretend to be someone else.  They refused to escalate the call.  Fed up, I found the number of the Expedia HQ in Las Vegas.  A receptionist sent my call to a voicemail that promised a return call in 24 to 48 hours.  We left three messages.  Nobody ever called back.  The receptionist sounded harried and embarrassed, saying she gets numerous calls like this every day and her hands are tied.

1311	            I rented a car through Firefly operated by Hertz. I used Expedia to do this. Expedia offered a great rate of $28(plus 15.99 fees) per day and $43.08 for an extra day. I told the agent the day I picked up the car, that I would need to extend it an extra day. When I returned the car, Firefly decided to void my contact and rate through Expedia and charged me $78/day because they claim I was supposed to call them the day of to extend the rental. I disagreed with that move and cited the option that Expedia gave me to extend at $43.08 per extra day. Firefly held that I needed to call and they penalized me with a full rate rental each day.I spent over an hour on the phone with Expedia who refused to require Firefly reimburse me the extra charges and honor the Expedia contract.I can't trust Expedia again.

1314	            I made a rental car reservation (bad idea) with expedia and they rip you off as they charge for insurance when you make the reservation and the rental car also charge for insurance and they do not talk to each other. When you find the problem and call Expedia, the agent that attends you is a big lyer and acts like he will solve your problem. In my case I was told that I would receive a refund for the double payment. After many days without receiving it, I called again and a new agent told me that no refund was requested and I would need to start a long process to see if I was entitled or not to a refund.  Be carefull when making any reservation with Expedia as they are professional in charging you for things that you will be charged by the service provider. Expedia is also master in not solving your problem and making you wait and wait for a solution and finally give up.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

1318	            Booked flights and car with Expedia. Looks great with all the messages about how you can change your booking etc. when I tried to change the car I discovered that the customer service number has been decommissioned for some time and still experiences a high volume of calls. Tried to email instead and that's a joke too. it just takes you round in circles telling you to amend your booking on line. I would have loved to have done so, but the website doesn't do what it says it does either! In the end I found a message saying someone had sent them a Facebook personal message and that had worked for them. I tried it and someone phoned me back within 90 minutes and sorted me out. she couldn't make an amendment though, so I had to cancel the car altogether. It makes me mad as I work in the supposed inefficient public sector; if we treated our customers like this we would be sacked!        	                23	1	Thursday	expedia	neutral

1321	            I booked a trip 6 months in advance to puerto vallarta with my fiance.. airfare, hotel and activites for ~$5000 usd. supposed to have a penthouse with private jacuzzi, snorkeling trip on secluded beach with reef and a zip line tour. First problem with them is they never allowed us to choose our seats on the plane, and sat us very far apart. The airline said to take it up with expedia they just did what they were told  (annoyed not ruined yet). Second problem, they gave us a jacuzzi suite instead of penthouse and when i looked online again at the hotel from expdias website they changed all the names and categories of the rooms and the hotel blamed it on expedia (a little more annoyed, not yet ruined). Third problem, i followed all directions on expedias site and paperwork to take boat to secluded beach. we were already checked in and arrived 30 min early just like we were informed to and the boat was already a couple hundred yards down the channel and was not going to come back (aggrivated). Fourth Problem, showed up for our zipline adventure and found out they didnt run that tour that day even though it was already booked for that day and i was already checked in according to expedia (very aggrivated, trip almost completely ruined). Fifth Problem was the hotels, our jacuzzi overflowed and flooded our room and the hotel didnt do anything to remedy the situation, even knowing that my fiance slipped on the water above mirror finish granite floors.(MAD! Ruined!) Sixth problem again on the flight home expedia put us on two different areas of the plane dispite booking months in advance (ANGRY,that dispite our best efforts to continually make the best of this trip all our plans were ruined by a company that could care less.. they got their money!!!). After we got back i spent about twelve hours on the phone with them taking to supervisors mangers and their corporate office, all i got for all my wasted efforts was a $200 credit for use at a hotel(still mad as hell but at least i got $200 back lol). i booked a trip using this credit, then found out my father passed away and had to cancel this trip to go to the funeral out of state during the same time period, and was told i would get the $200 credit refunded to my account. while booking the funeral arrangements i realized i never got the credit refunded back to my account. When i called to complete the booking using the missing credit, i was very rudely told that they do not refund credits and since i cancelled the reservation with it that its gone now. I asked to speak to another supervisor and after being on hold for an hour and twenty minutes i was hung up on. I HAVE HAD IT WITH THIS COMPANY!!! I will never use again and will avidly go out of my way to tarnish their name and reputation because in my eyes they have neither.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1322	            Now that I am actively searching for Expedia reviews (duh!),and finding abysmal ratings,  I realize that I could have figured this out all along.  Anyone have any idea how we can help consumers BEFORE they sign on with Expedia?  They probably aren't going to look here until after they have a problem.Don't use Expedia.  Especially for flights.  Use them for research, and then book directly with the airline.  I've had decent results with flights and hotels through Expedia until recently - not the cheapest, but I thought I was racking up points to use for discounts later.Expedia doesn't have a great relationship with every airline.  After I booked a round trip, I got an immediate cancellation from the airline.  Rebooked the flight through Exp., ended up with two return flights and unfortunately didn't figure it out until it was too late.  My bad!  Expedia:  more bad!Other issues:  some airlines charge for seat upgrades, even in economy.  If you book with Expedia, you don't know until AFTER that you might have to upgrade due to availability.  Book directly with the airline and you won't have this problem!  They show seats/prices BEFORE you finalize your purchase.   I reviewed this with the powers that be at Exp. and they only replied with boilerplate response.  They say:  “Every reservation is guaranteed to be the lowest rate available online during the time that you made the booking on our website.”But in response to my problem, they say: “Rates online change at a moment's notice and are never guaranteed unless purchased and reserved.”  Which didn't help me with the seat upgrade charge, I had purchased and reserved.  Also: “However, we cannot control these prices because if the airlines change it in five minutes or an hour then we will have to go with the current price at the time of booking.” My final response was:  You only guarantee the price UNLESS it doesn't change in five minutes or an hour (see your words above), OR if the airlines has available seats for no upgrade charges.  Too many ifs for me!I hope I hear back from someone, anyone, that figures out a way to prevent companies like Expedia from getting business in the first place!  They didn't seem to mind me stating that I would take my business elsewhere.        	                1	2	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1323	            My two friends and I decided to book a holiday to Bacelona with this horrendous company. It was the biggest mistake ever. We should have been on our flight to Barcelona at 6am believe it or not but we got to Barcelona almost 7pm AND my luggage was left behind. Also after we got to the hotel we realised that we was about 25mins away from the beach by car when we was told our hotel was walking distance from the beach. We end up spending so much money On cab. I would not recommend ANYONE to book through this company. Even when we got back I tried to call them to complain and let them know what an inconvenience they have caused my friends and I but no one was willing to put it right.

Only, after putting me on hold and trying to call the hotel but the manager had left for the day.On my third call I wanted to speak with a supervisor he told me to email him my cancellation email from them (Epedia) and a copy of the charge. (What a joke?!)Oh, this is the big thing did you cancell in time not to be charge???? According to my cancelled email I did, I cancelled 7 days early! I was still waiting on a call from them 6 days had passed! I called the hotel directly spoke with the manager and she gladly helped me with my refund.

1325	            We offered to book our elderly family members on the same flight to Canada although 1 member, for health reasons, had saved up to fly Business Class at considerable cost. My husband was unable to book them all online so contacted Expedia directly. The telephone operator booked the Business Class passenger on a different return flight to the others by mistake. When we realised this on the paperwork, Expedia wanted £350 to put it right, even though it was their representative who made the mistake.I have now spent 5 hours making many phone calls and put in a formal complaint to Expedia. They agreed to just charge the Delta airline cost of £200 which the elderly relative reluctantly agreed to pay whilst the complaint was investigated. By this point she was concerned about ensuring she was booked on the correct flight. The mistake was discovered with 2 months still to go before the flight and the representative I spoke to could not answer my question: “how long should we have had to check that the original details were correct?” Initially their answer was maybe 24 hours which I said was ridiculous considering the elderly relative was not online and I needed to post her the flight details to check!Expedia told me it would take 4 weeks to process my complaint and we are now up to 8 weeks with no response.They also charged my credit card with the £200 fee twice along with the discount of £150 which they should have taken off, not added to the bill. This has since been refunded. Over the hours that I have been kept waiting on the phone, all I could hear was a claxon going off and cheering which suggests to me that all this company is interested in is reaching sales targets. Incredibly unprofessional company and too willing to exploit those they perceive to have so much money that they don’t question these exorbitant charges. We found this particularly disappointing when it is Expedia themselves who made the error. We would never consider using them again for any future journeys.        	                2	1	Thursday	expedia	negative

1329	            I booked a 2 day stay in Lake George with Expedia.  The hotel was about 200.00 a night. The hotel was a dump ,Ft. William Henry Hotel and Conference Center. Check in was at 4 and we got there at 4:15 and the room was filthy. The bathroom had mold on the tiles and they left the dirty face towels in the tub. When Expedia asked me to write a review I suggested that people skip using them and call hotels directly. I say this because when I got up to Lake George I found nicer hotels at comprable prices. Expedia refused to write my review. They said it needed to be revised.  I guess the truth hurts.  I will not use them again and I recommend other people not use them . There are lots of options out there.        	                2	1	Monday	expedia	neutral

That never happened so I called them again and they apparently have NO record of my call. Then they tell me the SAME thing, that they will have to call me back tomorrow. I requested a supervisor and he said the same so I requested his supervisor and she said she was corporate office... She said she had to get approval from the hotel and that the person they needed to speak with was not there (how convenient). She told me that *i* needed to call back tomorrow around 8am because Expedia doesn't do outbound calls very well... She said she was ""setting my expectation""... And what is that? A very low expectation that my issue wasn't important enough to call me back and take care of me. She was rude and not helpful.

To top it off, even though I was assured I had a reservation for my new departure date and time, I did not.  Again, this was confirmed with the airline in question.

I should wait a few minutes, then try again.  I then spent 4.5 hours on the phone trying to get the problem solved.  I would explain the situation, then be put on hold, which soon became dead air.  The next thing I knew, I would be explaining everything to a new person, even though I asked to be reconnected to the person with whom I had been speaking.  At one point, I was told there was an error with my credit card, could I provide an alternate.  I did so, and was told again there was an error.  Iwas put on hold while (supposedly) the supervisor with whom I was speaking, got in touch with support.  I had enough time to verify with both card issuers that there was no problem at all from their end, and in fact the first card issuer had approved the transaction.  I was suddenly talking to yet another person, this one part of Expedia, Canada.  By the time I got frustrated and hung up, I had been on hold long enough to look up Expedia's corporate information and start drafting out a letter of complaint. Two of the so-called supervisors I spoke to said that they would escalate my complaint and that I would hear in either 48 or 72 hours. I tried again the next morning, with the same results.  Incidentally, the fare they were insisting was the best available was nearly $50 more than the one I was trying to book.  I tried again the following morning, with the same results.  I am holding the letter of complaint until after the 72 hours passes 9and I would assume no response will have been received) before mailing the letter.

1343	"            I have had the worst customer experience I have ever had - and it was with Expedia. Long story short - I reserved a room in Ft Lauderdale, FL for the night of 8/1/15. I subsequently cancelled the room through Expedia on 7/17/2015, more than two weeks before the deadline for no charge. Expedia sent me an email confirming the cancellation and relating that there would be no charge to my VISA account. My account was charged $107.67 on 8/2/2015. When I returned home, I called Expedia and the hotel. The hotel said it was Expedia's problem, Expedia said it was the hotel's problem. What a shock. On 8/18/2015, I spent 1 hour and 38 minutes on the phone with Expedia. The ""customer service rep"" spoke in broken English, to the extent that I was asking her to repeat nearly everything she said. Most of the 1:38 was spent on hold. The rest of it was being told that ""the hotel charged your account, so we can't do anything about it."" This, despite the fact that I made the reservation through Expedia, gave Expedia my credit card number, and never contacted the hotel at anytime about the reservation. I eventually got through to a supervisor who parrotted everything the rep had told me (in broken English, also). He promised that his manager would call me to further discuss the issue. The manager never called. On 8/24/2015, I again called Expedia. I got the same runaround from a CSR who spoke more heavily accented English than the first. This time I was on the phone for 1:25. I eventually spoke with a supervisor who spoke passable English, but who had the same immovable message"" we can't do anything about it. I asked for her manager and was told there was a wait time of 49 minutes. There was some good news out of that call. While I was on hold, I filed a dispute with VISA through my bank. It took about 8-10 minutes. At the conclusion, the $107.67 was back in my account (pending their investigation.). This why government regulation works. Unregulated companies will step all over you without fear of consequence. At least with the regulated banking industry, we have a slim chance. I had dealt with Expedia for 15 years. I will never deal with them again, and I urge everyone who values his sanity to stay away from this uncaring corporate giant. Thanks for letting me vent.

1345	            After the experience I had with there hotel booking dept.  I have decided to never use Expedia again. My girlfriend and I were planning a month long trip to Europe. I started out using Expedia to plan my flights and my hotel stays. The first hotel I booked was in Rome and I made my first mistake. I put in the wrong days that we planned to stay there. Unfortunately I did not notice that it was a non-cancelable non refundable booking. My mistake. I called Expedia to see if I could change the dates admitting that it was my mistake. They said they would call the hotel and see what they could do. Never heard from them again. I called the hotel and they were very helpful. We worked it out and they said they would allow me to change the days of my stay with them but, I had to contact Expedia to get it changed on their end. I received an email from Expedia saying they had contacted the hotel but, they would not allow me to change. I believe they never called the hotel. I called the hotel and told them that Expedia would not help. Finally the hotel intervened on my behalf and they said that they would contact Expedia and get it handled. I now have the reservation I wanted and Expedia did not lift a finger to try and help me. I'm still waiting for Expedia to contact me but, I'd be very surprised if they did. In the future I'll just call the hotel direct. Who needs help from a company that won't help you when you need it.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
1346	"            How to get best value from Expedia:1) hotels - identify what's available from Expedia then book directly on the hotel website. Often cheaper. Example £35 per night in Cambodia expedia , $40 directly. 2) Flights - don't bother booking a ""low cost"" airline through expedia. You'll need to log in to the airline website anyway to check in your luggage. Save yourself time by booking directly!3) Car hire - expedia offers the cheapest basic rates. But excluding other charges for full-empty rental returns for example. In Spain €110 for a full tank Ford Focus via expedia, €35 for a full tank directly from the local company (Centauro in this case). Plus these are companies that are hyper-sensitive about perceived minor damage on return but rather casual about recording damage on the way out. I got a dirty car, missing the aerial and some minor paint scuffs on the way out. No apparent process to prevent companies from charging more than one customer for the same damage. I'd go to a ""real"" rental company directly. At least you know what you'll be paying.        "	                1	2	Friday	expedia	negative
1347	            I've tried to book a flight and reached the credit card page. As I clicked the BOOK button to process my purchase, it sent me back to the credit card page with a small note at the top saying that they hate when it happens and prices have gone up whatever, by $150. Like, WHAT? I've already reached the credit card page, it look me like 10 seconds to input my information and the prices have already gone up by $150? It's totally unfair. Why aren't the prices already locked in when you are on the credit card page? I went to the airline's website and found the same ticket for $200 cheaper. EXPEDIA IS A JOKE. They are trying to milk out from you as much money as they can. Although, sometimes you may find cheaper tickets on expedia, most of the times, their prices are more than the prices found on the airline's websites. Before you book on expedia, check on the airline's website first. I just saved $200 by doing that.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive

1349	            Booked 2 one-way tickets to Paris for my honeymoon. Due to family illness, could no longer go, so was trying to change the flights to a year later. When I originally called, I was told the flight was non-refundable, and non-changeable, and that my options were to take the flight, or lose my money. I then received an email from customer service saying that I could in fact change the flight to an alternative date, and to call back. Upon calling back, and being on hold for an hour as they checked their file, and contacted the airline, I was told I would have to pick an alternate flight, and call back with the details prior to my original flight's departure. I waited a few weeks, as flights were not yet available for my desired date. About 1 month before expected departure, I called in again and stated that flights were not listed for my desired date, but I needed to change. I was on hold for over an hour when they disconnected my call. I called back again, was on hold over an hour AGAIN, and they said that they would forward my request to someone else to follow up with the airline. Airline policy was thay could only change the flight to one year after the date of booking, and I wanted to change the flight to 16 months after the booking date, but one year after expected departure date. No one in my previous phone calls had mentioned this fact. I was advised that would call the airline and get back to me within 48 hours.7 days passed and I called back AGAIN. Started from scratch with my storey with a new agent. Was transferred to a supervisor who reiterated the same story, said she would call the airline and call me back within 24 hours.5 days later, no call back. I called them. Started from scratch again. Was told my flight was non-changeable..... after looking into it, was told I could only change to one year after booking date, but would follow up with airline. Came back on the line after 1 hour 20 minutes, and stated there would be no extension to the date. I agreed to change the booking to the latest possible date. She advised she would transfer me to someone else who would process the change. Was disconnected (1 hour 40 mins into call).Called back immediately after, and advised what happened. Was on hold another HOUR. When they came back, I was advised changing the flight would be an additional $1,200. I told her I was not paying an additional amount. Am beyond livid that it took  8 PHONE CALLS FOR THEM TO TELL ME THIS. Am never dealing with expedia again, and hope I can save someone else the pain. The supervisor I spoke with was an absolute nightmare and a disgrace to the customer service industry.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1350	            I bought a ticket on Expedia , on buying the ticket the price is $194. On checking out it changes to $290, while up to the following day it was still up on their website for $194. I called them and the rep was very rude, he told me there is nothing that can be done and if I didn't like the price well, go buy from someone else.  I asked for a supervisor thinking that would help he was worst. He told me that what I buy is what I get. That's the price of the ticket and its not going to change. Then asked is there anything else you want me to help you with?  I told him to help himself.  Don't buy nothing through Expedia or One travel. I had my experience with them last year $2860 gone. Never again. Last year I bought tickets for the family to gone on vacation but then my brother was diagnosed with cancer and we could not go again.  I just asked if I could pay extra and move the tickets for future dates. They said no. When I asked I was 6 weeks away from the trip.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

1352	            At the beginning of the month I went to Expedia.com to book a flight to Chicago for a funeral.  I found a a number of very reasonable ROUNDTRIP air fairs with a number of different airlines.  Imagine my surprise when I went to book the flight and the price doubled.  I thought it was a glitch and tried a different airline.  It happened again.  I took a screenshot and called Expedia.com customer service.  A man tried a few things and then suggested I call the airlines directly for the best price.  I then asked he why he couldn't honor the website prices.  He hung up on me!

1353	            I made a reservation for a hotel through Expedia.com. When we arrived at the hotel, we were told that the Expedia reservation was only to hold the room and we were given a new bill, which we paid in cash and received a receipt. I later learned that I was also charged on my credit card by Expedia. I called Expedia and they contacted the hotel manager who admitted that we paid cash. The Expedia rep said that she saw no reason why my credit card charge would not be reversed and that she even wrote in the report that the hotel admitted to accepting cash for the room. She said that the hotel manager said he had to conduct an audit before allowing the refund. Later I received an email denying the refund. This was  no-brainer, but Expedia dropped the ball. I'm very disappointed with this experience.        	                2	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
1354	            Just had the worst Expedia experience - booked a hotel safe in the knowledge that Expedia offers Best Price Guarantee.. found the hotel cheaper and asked Expedia to honour its guarantee.

1355	            I bought a ticket has early as 8 AM UTC +1  I got the confirmation immediately i finished payment but just about an hour later I got a mail of cancellation. I was very surprised to get the cancellation message, I checked my bank statement i realized the ticket fee which is almost 500 euro has already been deducted. I immediately made contact with the customer care agent. The lady was very rude and put me on hold for more than 15 minutes, i had to call again and she told me she can't do anything that i should reply the mail which i later did.  Till when i post this feedback here which is almost 15:25 UTC +1  am yet to get the ticket, my refund or even a mail , i sent dozens of mails i did not get any response.  please don't do business with expedia, they will  make you like a fool and helpless if you do make payment on there site. Imagine I am only helping a friend to get ticket for his family outside italy to return back. They made look like an idiot that friend. I regret making payment on there site and I will advise you to run away from this time wasters        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive

1357	            I had a frustrating experience with Expedia when trying to make a change on a reservation I had already booked myself online previously. When I was unable to make a minor change online on a reservation I had orginally booked online, I called expedia. I told them I wanted to make a minor change to the original reservation but was unable to online. When I got off the phone with the first person I had spoken to I checked the email I got and the agent had cancelled my first reservation with the hotel, changed the type of room and the rate went up. After I called the second time the room type did get changed back but the rate was still higher.  I called back a third time spoke to another agent who then switched me to a manager who said he was not able to honor the original rate I had gotten and I explained to him that there was no reason for the rate change and that their company was unclear about what happens with rates when you make a change on a reservation within the change and cancellation time period.Sincerely,Unclear and Unprofessional        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative

When I was checking out, the pricing per night was 100$ more than what I had booked for in the first place. I was on the phone for 1h and 30 mins to get the original price back and unfortunately, they didn't try to do anything about because the extra 100$ were in their favour. I will never again book with Expedia.ca or hotel.com. I would give them 0 star if I could.        	                2	1	Sunday	expedia	positive
1359	            Booking with Expedia has been a horrendous but enlightening experience.  Customer service keeps you on hold for extended periods without servicing  calls and never comply with promises for call backs.  Upper management cannot resolve or give real time frames in which matters at hand can be resolved and don't read up on prior calls before speaking to customers. They reference the high volume of calls coming in, each an every time as the excuse for not complying.  Well...the high volumes are not my problem - especially when my vacation was paid in full on the night of booking. Upon booking my itinerary,  breakfast was included at the hotel for seven days.  Upon receiving the emailed confirmation, it was not listed and there began my numerous phone calls to try to bring this matter to resolution.  After one of many conversations with reps, a harsh and rude supervisor, Mallory  asked me to stop calling back until  this was resolved and I heard back from someone.   Once the original booking call could be pulled and listened to by upper management, I'd get a call back.  She gave me a compliance date of August 10 grudgingly.   I decided to check today, August 8,  as I had more availability and after being on hold on and off for close to two hours,  with little servicing - Supervisors Tanya and Daylin stated that they heard the original 30 minute booking call where I asked for breakfast twice during the call, but it was never confirmed by agent. I was appalled!!!  This reply insinuates that I am a liar....When I asked to listen to the call, as I know what I confirmed, I was told by Tanya that I'd need a subpoena in order to listen to the call!  Really? I then asked to speak to supervisor Daylin and  Tanya informed me that she could not call me back until 7-10 days.  Shabby, shabby customer service skills!  I shouldn't be shocked but I am, when I truley believe that honesty prevails.  After reading all the entries in these reviews I see that I am not alone.  Expedia will never see my $ again or anyone else that I can share this horrid experience with.  Expedia must step up to the plate and take responsibility for what agents confirm. How dare Expedia treat customers with little dignity and respect, when without us, they wouldn't be in business!  Extremely disappointed in deceptive tactics used by Expedia.  Will follow up with complaint to Better Business Bureau.   Beware!        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	positive
1360	            Flew into Indianapolis for family reunion. Hertz says they did not have my reservation through Expedia. I showed them my confirmation, and Hertz said that was for their location across town, a $30-$40 cab ride away. Why would they book it there? The airport Hertz was able to find me another car. Then at the hotel, they told me I did not have reservations. I showed them the confirmation and they said they never received them from Expedia. I called Expedia and they insisted that the hotel had them. Four hours on the phone with Expedia later, Expedia found another hotel 20 miles away for the first night and nothing for the second night. Then I received an email from Expedia saying my credit card had been credited for $395 with no explanation. I paid for the first hotel and found another for the second night, at rates higher than I had paid to Expedia. I then tried to get satisfaction from Expedia. They hung up on me, put me on hold one time for 30 minutes, and other efforts to get me to go away. I just spent another hour on the phone with someone form Expedia who spoke only marginal English, and finally they promised to have a supervisor call me this afternoon. I intend to repeat this story on travel review sites until they make this right.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive

1362	            I recently made a reservation thru Expedia for a hotel in Moscow, The Cosmos Hotel. The hotel advertises the rooms and its facilities on Expedia. At the end you find out that it is false advertisement. Expedia is aware and still allows this hotel to continue doing fraudulent advertisement on their site.After I paid for the hotel room for 8 nights I had to check out after staying there for only four nights because the hotel turns off the AC at night, making impossible to sleep in the rooms to the high temperatures in summer.I made a second reservation at a different hotel thru expedia again with a promise from the hotel and from Expedia that I was going to be refunded for the nights I did not stay at the hotel. At the end Expedia just offered a $50.00 coupon for my next trip and apologized for the inconvenience.Unacceptable!!!I have been trying to have this issue resolved, but looks like this is going nowhere.There are plenty of online travel agencies that are much better than Expedia, like Travelocity.NEVER AGAIN EXPEDIA!        	                4	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive

The first gentlemen listened, told me he had made notes on my case and said to expect to receive a call back within 3 hours, I waited and heard nothing. I then called again first thing in the morning and spoke with a different person, she had no idea about my case as the original gentlemen made no notes and there was nothing in system regarding my complaint. She assured me she would take care of it and I would receive a call within 16 minutes. I waited 2 hours and again, no call. I called back at third time and spoke with someone else would had no idea either, I provided him with my case number and he was still clueless so I had to explain the situation yet again. He had me on hold for over 36 minutes, only to tell me that he could not help me and that I should be expecting a call within 3 hours. I said absolutely not, I want to speak with someone right now. He then asked to put me on hold and hung up on me! I have never been more upset in my life. NEVER WILL I USE EXPEDIA!        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1364	            We booked a package for round trip air fare and an apartment in Iceland.  The apartment access was through a code that they sent to Expedia which Expedia never passed along to us.  I had called Expedia twice before leaving  for Iceland to confirm that they did not have an entry code for us and and both customer service representatives assured me that there would be a manager at the apartment complex upon arrival.  In fact they told us there was a manager on the premises 24/7.  When we arrived at the apartment after a night of flying, not only was there no manager at the building at all, but the other tenants said they all received their access codes a few weeks prior to arriving.  I made an international call to Expedia while sitting on the stoop outside of the building and was transferred to five different people within a two hour period and no one; NOT ONE customer rep. would help us.  They kept transferring me to other departments. After the fifth transfer and two hours later, I hung up.

1365	            Expedia has no idea about the hotels they are contracting you with. When you get there, they almost always never look like the posted pictures and are under renovations ( a very broad term). Hot tub and pool areas are closed, re-roofing with shingles and aluminum trim falling off the roof to the parking area. You suddenly loose you television reception for the night ( maybe because of the stuff falling from the 3 story building) and that makes for a really enjoyable night with nothing to do or watch. If the hot tub is working it is either way too cold and not at the health regulated 104 degrees or it has so much chlorine in it to mask what ever that you can't use it.What has happened to our hotel industry and the thought of relaxing night so you can resume your vacation recharged. We have booked 25 rooms over the past month and a half and will never book again from Expedia...In the future we will talk to the hotel direct get the true facts and make the agreement with them        	                2	1	Sunday	expedia	positive
1366	            o far I believed that cheapoair.com has the worst customer service on the web, but now I confirm that I was wrong. Expedia championed them by far and large. I had to make a simple correction of the name (name in place of surname) I called CS in singapore which dealt with the booking exactly 10 times just to realize that only thing which i can get from them is kind but useless standardized answers at the end of which i was told that would be called back once the problem is sorted out. Do i have to say that the call never arrived? I also explained the problem by email, enclosing passenger's passport, but of course i have never received an answer or any reaction at all. Finally, after 10 days I cancelled the flight since i didnt want my spouse to face problems she once experienced in the same situation. It is here where expedia's total uselessness entered in the domain of bizarre. I cancelled the flight on July 26. An operator told that I will get cancellation confirmation email within 10 mins. Email has never arrived. On 27th i called again to ask for confirmation email; I explained that on itinerary number i can see cancellation, but I need email confirmation. Oh, the operator said, sorry SIr, you will get the mail with 5-10 mins. Result? ZERO! At that point i stopped to make calls to non-existent CS and on July 28th I wrote email to THEM using their CS contact page which stated that all emails are answered within 48 hours: 96 hours later no answer. Instead, on the same day I received cheerful email stating: pack your bags, your flight is CONFIRMED? Since nothing worked with this absolute garbage, I could just hope that refund will be done. Luckily on July 31 i received SMS from my CC that amount, minus penalties, was refunded. BUT the there is no end to Expedia absurdity as today, Aug 1 after all that hokum, after my itinerary was officially cancelled, after i was REFUNDED, i received email saying: your flight is confirmed, get ready, your departure is within 24 hours!!!! I fly for work and tourism 30 years and can say that the utmost uselessness of expedia is the worst i experienced in many years. MY suggestion is: stay away from this absolute junk. You will lose money, time, nerves and can only dream about support. Lesson learnt: in September I am going to Europe with my spouse, but i booked the ticket directly with Lufthansa, paying 2600$ and losing 200 but even that is better than to deal with Expedia.com        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative

Why the Expedia rep did not mention this, as had he done so the cost was only £14 per bag at the time of booking. The trip was for 10 days, so obviously we had baggage.On querying this with Expedia they eventually agreed to reimburse the baggage cost for the outward trip but not the return journey.Numerous emails, complaints and feedbacks have resulted in no communication whatsoever from Expedia.        	                3	1	Monday	expedia	negative

Two times I called and got told Expedia’s manager would fix it. I felt uneasy about it so I called back again, now they want to charge me 2 hundred dollars more even though the hotel manager said, there was no change of the price. Expedia was actually trying to charge me more, than the hotel.  I was better off taking the loss and going through the hotel directly. By the way they left me on hold for over 25 minutes not to deal with me. They said they did what was policy.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1377	            My wife has been tried to book a flight via Expedia.  They not only didn't provide the tickets, they have held the money within our checking account, TWICE.  So now we are without $1600 of our money and can;t book elsewhere.  Now she has called them THREE times and they have yet to been able to help her either get the tickets or get our money released.  Hey Expedia, try spending some more money on computer software that works and training your customer service staff and a little less on advertising!!        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive
1378	            During the online booking process my husband accidentally selected the hotel option without breakfast.  Upon realising our mistake, we contacted Expedia to try and rectify this.  At the time, the difference was around $180 AUD over the time of our stay.  I immediately emailed them to advise of our mistake and over 24 hours later received a phone call advising to call and they would fix this for us.The person on the end of the phone tried to charge OVER $400 AUD for daily breakfast for 2 adults in Thailand and had English skills so poor that they also tried to book an additional different room.I emailed to complain because this process was so frustrating and found that the person I spoke to made no notes on this phone call to indicate this.  They then tried to tell me at the time of my phone call the room type I was after was not available which is completely untrue as I could see this room type available on their website (for the record it is still available).I am getting nowhere with customer service who now emailed me to tell me they could do nothing, contradicting the below email where they assured they were able to help.This is completely unacceptable and I will NEVER be using Expedia ever again.  Rude, unprofessional and a complete joke.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
1379	            I booked two nights stay in hotel.  Few hours later seen it direct from hotel for $40 cheaper per night.  Promptly called as they gaurentee best price or they pay you the difference and a $50 credit.  HOAX!!! I filed a claim as directed.  They rejected as the screenshot stated the price before taxes and fees.  So I then called and was told to submit again with PDF of the other screen shot I had with the desired taxes and fees listed.  As they do NOT tell you that is needed in your screen shot and they only let you submit 1.  I sent again and waited... And called and waited ... 7 calls later, each one with the worst customer service and even talked to so called supervisors who know nothing and can not help you at all but pass you on to the next idiot who claims the same lack of knowledge. 7 calls and 7 emails later I have gotten nowhere.  This is their game... Play you and keep brushing you off until the customer is so fed up with no help and getting nowhere they give up.  This company needs to be shut down or exposed for the horrible service they provide to customers.  They are an embarrassment to the service industry.  I asked for the complaint department and was told by supervisor AYA THAT SHE WAS THE COMPLAINT DEPATMENT .  They do not care about their customers and I feel sorry for the people that work there as they must take a beating from unhappy customers daily.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
1380	            Expedia Itinerary: 117363106299I am extremely disappointed and flabbergasted with the Expedia customer service staff. On 12 July 2015, I went to the Agora Place Hotel as booked. When the receptionist told me that I had to top up 9000Yen for 2 persons as I only booked for 1 pax.  I informed her that I actually booked for 2 paxs. She said that she would only follow the printed out voucher which stated 1 pax.  I then called her to help me called Expedia Singapore and she was very kind to assist me in calling. The customer service staff named Jaya who attended my issue was rude and unkind. I told her that I actually book for 2 paxs. She insisted that she couldn’t assist me and demanded me that I had to pay the extra charges for 2 paxs. She even told me that no one in Expedia even the top management can’t help me and insisted it was my fault.I demanded her to transfer the line to her manager if she couldn’t assist me. She refused and told me that the manager was busy with another line. Throughout the whole conservation, she was rude and crude. She refused to do any investigation and even the manager didn’t even bother to take my call. Throughout the whole conservation, she had let me hold for more than 20mins for 3 occasions.Expedia had employed such unprofessional staffs who never care for their customer. I urged the management of Expedia to seriously look into this case. Please investigate and get back to me.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative
1381	            I had an airline booking problem. My flight was booked on Expedia, but the airline knew nothing about my reservation. I was on the phone with Expedia with three different customer service reps, each for about one hour (3 hours total). The reps had no access to view my itinerary. After being unable to help me, they all tried to get me off the phone using different methods. The first time they transferred me to the airline who knew nothing about my issue. The second time they transferred me to the airline insisting that the airline now knew about my problem. Same story -- airline knew nothing about what was happening. The third time they came back on the phone after a 45 minute wait on hold and said it was all resolved and provided me with a booking number. I had the airline's website on my screen and immediately typed it in. It was a bogus booking number. As soon as the rep realized what I was doing she desperately tried to hang up. Can you believe that? The Expedia rep fabricated a booking number to get me off the phone. So, then she said she would call me back. She took my number. Obviously, there was not going to be a callback.I am astounded that the media is not covering this criminal organization. Seriously, Expedia is a scam. I had no idea. Now I know. Don't be fooled.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
1382	"            My friend and I booked a nonrefundable room based on their ""best price guaranteed"" statement. When my friend found a better deal (same room, same dates), he was able cancel with Expedia. However, they did not cancel my booking even though I'm a gold member, and my friend barely uses Expedia. It is like a joke! Supervisors have no authority and no clue when it comes to customer satisfaction...they don't know how to keep a customer who spends thousand of dollars each year.

1383	"            I signed up here just to voice my opinion about this horrible, horrible company, as I sit on hold, yet again, waiting to be hung up on - again.Everything about Expedia is utterly disappointing, from the moment you give them your credit card details. Trying to resolve anything is emotionally draining and verging upon impossible. Their ""service"" staff are rude and condescending, and in order to plead your case, you have to work on their rude, condescending level.I am sure that every day Expedia profit thousands of dollars from the countless transactions they refuse to refund or simply attend to, like a normal travel agent would. Make sure your hard earned stays away from the dishonest rogues behind Expedia.My facts:I booked a flight and they charged more between the booking page and the confirmation page, blaming the airline's ""pricing policy"" for the extra charge.I wore that and thought I'd stick with them anyway.  In the end I had to cancel my flight, wearing a USD$200 cancellation fee.Six weeks ago I requested a refund and I'm still waiting.They just sent me an email saying they will now process the refund, which I'll receive between 3 and 15 days from now.Apparently up until now, despite all the phone calls, the refund had not even been ""activated"" - whatever that means.So I guess now I have an email from Expedia saying that they are going to do something about my refund, things are great! Hmm... wait.. still no refund. I'll check back here in a week or so and update my experience.Just to top off the worst customer experience with Rohid and Parul, amongst many others at their 3rd party call centre, I also discover that Expedia now also practices racial profiling! Despite speaking in English on the phone, Parul sends me a refund confirmation in Chinese, because if I live in Hong Kong, I must only be able to read Chinese, right? Stay clear of this company.        "	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1384	            So I booked a flight to Indonesia. I called the customer service to confirm my purchase and asking for an email confirmation. During our call, I was told that the flight was cancelled by the airlines and that my credit card will not be charged. To solve this problem, I decided to book another flight. I found the same exact flight in Expedia; the same exact flight that got cancelled. At this point, I already booked two flights. Later during the day, I called them again to get confirmation and turns out it got cancelled again. They apparently keep a cancelled flight in their list.So because both of my booked flight got cancelled, I decided to book another flight from a totally different airline on a different day. This one went through without any problem and I got a confirmation.Upon checking my email, I got an email that my second booked flight that I booked got confirmed out of nowhere. After they confirmed to me that the flight got cancelled, and I bought another flight, now they told me the flight got cancelled. Now I have 2 tickets to Indonesia.VERY BAD! DO NOT USE!        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative
1385	            Last weekend I booked a flight amounting to just under 500 euros with Expedia. I left out one of the middle names of the passengers and rang them up (5 mins after the booking) to ask if this would be a problem for the airline. The customer service rep told me to be better safe than sorry and that because I had only just booked the flight, he said he'd cancel and refund the flight for me so that I could start fresh with another booking. He told me the refund would be within 72 hours. There was very little stress on the phone - it seemed very straight forward - no issues. Soon after that I did a google search and came across nothing but bad reviews regarding Expedia and refunds. Naturally this got me extremely worried and nervous as to whether I would actually get the refund. However I waited the 72 hours but still nothing refunded - instead it appeared to be two sets of flights charged for instead of one. I got straight onto customer service who said that Expedia hold the money and the airline withdraws also (really confusing). They told me that this was normal and that the refund would definitely be coming through. The next day - about 96 hours later - all funds were back in the account and I was extremely relieved. As there are so many bad reviews of Expedia on this in regards to refunds, I wanted to post this to say that it is possible to get the physical refund back from them within the week you have booked (with a couple of customer service calls) - although maybe I was a rare lucky one?? With regards to cancelling and getting refunds closer to your holiday time - I don't have any experience and it may be a completely different story. I just wanted to share my story.        	                1	4	Sunday	expedia	positive
1386	            I have never written reviews of products or services, but I feel so strongly against Expedia that I feel I must warn others about this provider. I would not have booked another trip with Expedia after my first bad experience, but sadly, I had booked 3 trips with Expedia around the same time, without knowing what a bad decision that was. It was one horrible experience after another.1. I had booked a trip to Peru with my family, with plane tickets costing over $4000. I had to cancel the trip a week in advance as I was very ill and in no condition to fly. I called up Expedia and it said that it could not refund me and that I should check with the airline instead. I did so, and the person I spoke to at the airline said that he could refund me all taxes and surcharges paid, amounting to around $800, but that the refund will have to be initiated by Expedia, which made the booking. I called up Expedia to help, and the rep said that she was unable to contact the airline. I gave them the name and contact of the person I spoke to at the airline, but the Expedia rep said they had a different airline contact person. Despite numerous calls, emails and postings on Expedia's website, they did not respond further to me.2. I booked a stay at a hotel in New York, and somehow Expedia submitted a booking for 2 rooms instead of 1 to the hotel. Upon arrival, I showed the hotel my booking printout, which indicated a booking for 1 room. I asked them to call up Expedia to verify my booking, and Expedia said that the 2nd booking was made by their sister company, Hotel.com. I have never accessed that website and am not sure what occurred at the backend which resulted in 2 bookings made. Expedia was unable to assist in confirming with the hotel that only 1 booking was made. Thankfully, the hotel was kind enough to cancel 1 of the bookings that they had reserved for me and bill me for only 1 room.3. My third (and final) experience was a booking I made for a trip to Vancouver for a holiday with my family. Much of the fault was with United Airlines, which had multiple flight cancellations and delays during our flights there and back from Washington DC. That said, I had consciously avoided United Airlines, and had booked my trip with Air Canada through Expedia, without realising that Expedia could put you on ANY airline without first alerting you, and they had put me on United Airlines flights. We had 1 connecting flight both ways, and our flights were cancelled/delayed on the way there and back. We had to scramble at the airport to get on new flights, and I had to keep checking the website as I did not receive any alerts through Expedia (despite leaving my mobile number and email), while passengers who had booked directly with the airline received updates and were able to respond more promptly to the flight changes.So that's that. 3 complete disaster bookings with Expedia. Never again. The bookings and payments online may have been smooth and hassle-free, and the prices reasonable, but any subsequent follow-up has been a nightmare. You have been warned.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
1387	            They changed a flight of mine where I had accidentally  booked the wrong date.  I called back immediately and was told it was within their policy to cancel my flight and rebook another which they did while I was on the phone with them for 90 minutes.  Well they only cancelled the flight in ONE DIRECTION, and then refused to refund me.  They blamed the airline QANTAS, who by the way, within a month paid their share of the fee (NZ$750).  They had agreed to split it with QANTAS.  It is 6 months now, over 100 hours in phone calls and emails, and now they have gone so far as to have taken my credit card info 4 TIMES TO REIMBURSE ME and they screw it up every time.  They are now blaming my credit card company saying they reimbursed me despite my credit card company saying they never received it.  You get phone calls to and from India at bizarre times, none talks to each other despite having a reference number.  It's an absolute mess.  They need to completely SHUT DOWN.        	                4	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
1388	            When booking an Expedia flight the price that was advertised went up the last minute of booking. So you put all your info in and Expedia knows you probably don't want to do that again...that's when they got me for 30 extra bucks. I know it's not much but it is the principle I'm concerned with so be wary. I will never use them to book another thing again.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	neutral
1389	            My two sisters and I recently stayed for a week at Hotel Monteleone.  Our trip was a combination of business and pleasure - one of us was there for the Million Dollar Roundtable and the other two came just to play. The Monteleone is right in the French Quarter and close to great restaurants,  live music and merriment. The staff - the door men who made us feel like we were royals, the helpful and personable front desk staff, and the hardworking and very efficient staff who cleaned and tidied our room each day were all first rate.  I do have to give a special gold star to hotel concierge Anne Brett who helped fill our days and evenings with all kinds of fun. Based upon our interests, she made recommendations that included historical spots, places to wander and antique shops to peruse. She made reservations for two plantation tours and dinner reservations for several restaurants we wanted to visit. My sisters and I plan to take a trip each year.  My vote is to come back to New Orleans again and stay at the Hotel Monteleone.  When we do, our first stop will be at Anne Brett's desk!        	                1	5	Thursday	expedia	positive

They finally call the hotel and after a few minutes hang up on the hotel then on us.Have to call again at which time I go through the whole thing again and they eventually call. They hang up with the hotel mid sentence then expedia tells me the hotel is running the new card in the other line and itll just be a minute. I tell the person at Expedia I'm at the hotel desk and Expedia just hug up without giving no any info to the hotel. He backed up and Said I mean we are getting the info and will call back. I'm then put on hold for 37 minutes before being disconnected. Hotel at my request cancels the room and we pay a higher price for it. I request a call back from Expedia to which they say an hour and twenty six minutes which seems their permanent hold time.   Four hours later while we were sleeping I get a robocall asking for ""valued customer"" and it disconnects.Next day I call for a refund. 45 minutes on hold and promises of a refund and that the refund was complete and guess what no refund.

I was promised a call back within 24 hours FOUR TIMES by four different members of staff and each time I have to chase them up.

This included flight, hotel, food, and beverages.... sounds like a win to me. I even got a phone call from the hotel a few days prior letting me know the name of my ""concierge"" for my trip.

1396	"            I booked a trip on expedia.com over one month ago, the booking went through smoothly, my credit card was charged and I received a confirmation email. In the confirmation email, I got confirmations for my flights (round trip) and my hotel stays booked. In the email, my flights were showing ticketing in process. I didn't think much since all flights got confirmation numbers and my credit card was charged in full. And I never received another email/phone call letting me know something has gone wrong.Less than 3 Days before my trip, I wanted to pick my seats on the flights and found out my flights were never booked!!!! Expedia only booked me 3 nights of hotel stay in a foreign country with no flights, and charged me in full for the entire trip.I called the customer service immediately to figure out what went wrong. I was told I was responsible to check the status of the booking despite the confirmation email and the fees being charged. The representative sorted out my flights to the destination but told me my original return flights are no longer available and I only have 2 options. During the conversation I went on the Expedia mobile app and saw there are other flights available that fit my schedule (I have booked activities and airport transfer during my stay through a third party travel agency). When I mentioned I saw flights close to my original booking time and it works with my schedule to the representative I was basically told ""that doesn't make sense"". I don't understand the back-end process at Expedia to source flights, but I don't believe telling a customer ""that doesn't make sense"" is acceptable in this case. At the very end, I was given the 2 disappointing options and was told that ""i've done the best I could, now you choose"". I know for a fact after searching on Expedia's own app that there are other flights available that works with my schedule. When I mentioned to the representative that I booked everything according to the flights, he told me ""you can easier call the travel agencies and change it, every travel agency could do that for you"". Even the 2 options given to me less than 3 days before my trip are not confirmed. I was told I will be contacted to confirm the new flights but they are not confirmed now.What a disappointing experience. I used to book most of my personal travels through Expedia. I travel frequently for work and leisure, and never had this issue before. This is a first and last for me with Expedia.        "	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive

But after several phone calls and over 10 hours spent on the phone, Expedia refused to acknowledge their mistake of short changing us from one person's hotel room. Their suggested resolution was for me to pay for another single person booking which was as much as two people's bookings for the 1 person!When you call their customer service, an automated system takes your number to call back after an hour and 15 minutes... every time and nay time you call...

We had two itineraries with the same outgoing flight and different return legs, and the airline sent a schedule change for the outgoing flight. On one itinerary, the schedule change was correctly reflected; however, on the other, the outgoing flight was cancelled entirely instead of changing departure times.  I phoned Expedia customer service, and they said the flight had been cancelled.  I told them to look at the other itinerary and see that it was not cancelled but rather the schedule had changed. They looked and acknowledged that that appeared to be the case, but said I would have to call the airline and pay a rebooking fee to schedule onto another flight which I said was ridiculous.  I called the airline, and they fixed the issue free of charge, but shortly after, the flight was cancelled again. Not wanting to deal with Expedia again, I phoned the airline directly and had them fix it and confirm that it was Expedia sending the erroneous cancellation request. I decided to phone back Expedia to try to have them look into why their system kept sending a cancellation. The person I spoke to was incredibly rude and hung up on me. Fortunately, after several attempts, the airline was able to block Expedia out entirely so our flight would stop being cancelled. Of course Expedia still denies any wrongdoing.  They have basically said they will consider my feedback as they continue to work to improve their services, but judging by the plethora of other similar complaints I see, that is not at all the case.  I will never use their service again without major changes being made. Just hoping to save someone else the frustration of dealing with them.        	                2	1	Thursday	expedia	negative

1405	            BELIEVE ALL OF THE REVIEWS!! I booked two hotel rooms on Expedia for a specific date. When the confirmation comes Expedia changed the date! They refused to refund my money even though services provided from their company proved the date I actually intended to book (scratchpad). They would not admit their error and kept me on the phone for 4 hours! Refused to give me any upper management or change the date! Worst company for customer service. This company is a joke and a scam!!! They hold your credit card info not the hotel... And then push off the error on the hotel. Which is false as they are the ones holding your money.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
1406	"            PLEASE BELIEVE THE TERRIBLE REVIEWS ON HERE! I was literally disconnected 10 times as I was being transferred to their ""Help Desk"" to determine the amount of a voucher due to me. Each time I called back I was told there were no notes in the computer and I had to go through the whole story again. Interestingly I was told something different on about 5 of those 10 calls. I finally asked that they not put me on hold but rather have the team lead call the Help Desk while I stayed on the line with the rep to whom I was speaking. They told me that was not possible and their technology would not allow them to do that. I literally laughed out loud and asked if the rep was saying that with a straight face. He assured me that it was true and they must follow procedure. Stupidly I allowed it one more time. Guess what. I am calling back now after being disconnected during the transfer. (By the way - I gave my call back number and asked to be called if disconnected. They agreed but never called back.) This has actually become somewhat of a game to me - unfortunately I don't have time for it. NEVER, EVER BOOK WITH EXPEDIA. YOU ARE BETTER OFF PAYING MORE WITH A LEGITIMATE COMPANY.

1409	            I booked a hotel in Daytona, Florida through Expedia. I'm writing my complaint now because it bothers me that Expedia doesn't take responsibility for their actions. EXPEDIA WASHES THEIR HANDS CLEAN FROM TAKING ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY OF THEIR ERRORS.  This is not right. What happened is, I booked a reservation for a hotel and the date changed. And Expedia admitted that I  booked it for the date I wanted, but then the date changed after it booked. A so called Manager was able to track down my online booking. Somehow Expedia recorded following my navigation on their webpage. Again, I booked a hotel reservation.  And it changed. Yes, the date changed within minutes. I assumed it was correct. And then, They blamed me for not noticing the change on the email confirmation. I assumed it was done right. I lost over $3000 dollars. I will never use Expedia again. All my friends or family will not use Expedia again. And they haven't. Expedia are the mafia of travel websites. They ROB you with your eyes open. They should be punished by law. I'm still very upset. I'm not a wealthy person. And don't have $3000 dollars to throw away. It is very upsetting. I have to admit. I did cry my eyes out.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative

I was very upset after the interaction with the customer service representative with the name Maryann. Expedia messed up my trip to Hawaii that cost me about $5000 and did not want to do anything about it. The customer service was rude and useless.

1411	            We wanted a reservation at Podollan Inn in Salmon Arm BC for July 9, leaving July 10.  The online booked reservation came back July 8, leaving July 9.  I attempted to change the reservation online twice, but the confirmations still came back July 8, leaving July 9.  I tried to telephone, but was informed that there would be a 38 minute wait!  Out of frustration, I telephoned the hotel directly and explained what was happening.  They said they've been having a lot of trouble with Expedia lately, and it seemed their software wasn't operating properly.  I made a reservation with the hotel directly and cancelled the Expedia reservation.  Ironically, when the confirmation of the cancellation came, the email had the CORRECT dates on it - July 9, leaving July 10. Clearly Expedia has software problems with their website, and they need to have easily accessible human beings to sort things like this out expeditiously.  I will not be booking using Expedia again.  You cost me an hour to sort this out myself.        	                2	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

To date I have send numerous emails to Expedia with no response and tried numerous times to try and sort this out over the phone.  Nobody bothers to make contact with you which I find frustrating and disgusting.

1413	"            No one is paying me to write this, I'm just frustrated as hell and want to get the word out.  After gobbling up all of its competitors (travelocity, orbitz, trivago, hotels.com, eLong, etc.) the customer service interface has just gotten worse and worse.  I entirely agree with most of the comments of previous posts.  My gripe is that I tried to change a hotel booking arrival date about 30 seconds after confirming and paying, but many days and wasted hours later I still cannot move the arrival date, even though the Hotel fully confirmed it's no problem.  When you go on Expedia customer service site, the first thing they tell you is that it's best just to cancel the booking and rebook than to try and change.  Well, they are correct, because I can tell you it's extremely difficult to coordinate the hotel and Expedia to talk to eachother, and Expedia makes $25-30 bucks per pop for each cancellation.  Naturally, they are going to tell you that it's better to ""cancel and rebook"". They've got the game wired to make it terribly difficult to make changes.  Proving that might be hard, but I just wanted to get the word out, and urge people just to make their own bookings directly with the hotels.        "	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1414	            Do never ever use Expedia!6 reasons not to use Expedia:1. Difficult, if not impossible, to get a refund. I have spoken to probably 10 customer service representatives now and I still have not received my refund, though Expedia promises every time I call that the refund will be made within 2-3 days. That has been a month now.2. The waiting time to the hotline is 30-40 minutes, and when you get through to a customer representative, whatever you ask them, they are going to put you on hold for 20-30 minutes - every time.3. Calls frequently get abruptly disconnected even after you have waited for an hour - and then you have to start all over.4. Their staff is poorly trained! I had to speak to four representatives before I was told that I could not change the name on my tickets. The three previous representatives I spoke to said I could.5. Their staff (Singapore branch) speak poor English, making it hard to communicate on the phone as well as in writing. I sent an e-mail (again) requesting that they refund my flight tickets. A reply came back saying they had sent me my booking information...???6. The customer service does not respond to e-mails. That is, out of the five e-mails I have sent, they have responded to only one.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

I talked to 4 people over 2+ hours (most of it on hold) including a ""Manager"" from the Escalation Office, named Carl Williams, who assured me issue would be taken care of and I would get a call back the next day.

1417	            Is the normal anxiety of family vacation not doing it for you? Traveling with an infant and a four year old is no easy feat but Expedia really goes the extra mile by sending a sweet little seat request. When this is ignored they promptly do nothing. When you get to the airport you can find out in person that you don't have a secured seat, or even seats next to each other, just a miniature asterisk that leaves it up to the good 'ol airline to figure out. This really adds a nice zest to your vacation after a delayed flight and litany of tantrums. I will never use Expedia again. Our family was looking for both the best and cheapest option. Flying is stressful, maybe not as stressful as the in-laws but it's preoccupying. No one should have to worry about having a panic attack in the sky because there family has been scattered like marbles across an airplane.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
1418	            I booked a reservation at a hotel because of the awesome deal Expedia offered. However, I tried to split the payment between 2 credit cards when we checked in. They let us know we needed to call Expedia for that. Since then, I have called twice and been told I can't split the payment. This is completely unacceptable and I have never been treated like this when I use a competitor. Both times I asked to speak with a supervisor and now, for the second time, I was put on hold both times over 10 minutes and told that your company doesn't offer this. I work in the customer service field and am appalled by this. It's a $0.00 transaction. I travel constantly and can assure you I will never use your company again and be sure to tell all of my well-traveled friends about this as well.        	                1	2	Wednesday	expedia	positive

If you are considering booking with Expedia and value your sanity and you don't have money to waste...AVOID at all (literal) cost.I booked flights for my boyfriend to see his dad in the US with a second leg on the same trip for a wedding. Both legs of his journey had their own share of flight drama, and I found myself having to ring Expedia to assist with schedule changes.Even to consider dealing with Expedia akin to recompense for sins committed, but even  that does not warrant a satisfying explanation for the torment I endured.

At Expedia's complete mercy.Total number of calls made at least 11Call mysteriously disconnected once ( a good day?)Average length of call 45-50 minsAverage hold length: 20 minsNumber of times given conflicting stories - 4 timesNumber of times they avoiding taking responsibility (advised to speak to airline direct/speak directly with airport staff, or told categorically there is nothing they can do) - 5 timesNumber of times I lost my rag and started to rant about dissatisfaction - 6 times Please please do not use this company because your life may well depend on it, I'm not exaggerating From personal experience and from reading other reviews, they really DO NOT care. Despite the severity of the situation - and plead with them all you like - they will avoid taking responsibility for their mistakes.

1425	            Being my first time working with expedia, I NEVER would have imagined what a hassle this company is. My boyfriend and I tried to book a flight, when I went to process my credit card, the website said that there was a problem and my card would not go through, HOWEVER I was immediately charged by one of the airlines and never sent any type of confirmation email for the flight. We spent 2 hours on the phone with customer service, and no one could tell us why we were charged at all for one of the flights as they had no record of it. They told me that they couldnt do anything and I would have to contact my bank and claim fraud although it was CLEARLY not a fraudulent incident. Before getting off the phone with an apparent supervisor at expedia.. she told us that she would help us book our flight over the phone BUT in a matter of 2 hours the flight we wanted had increased by $100 a ticket. She would not honor the price from the SAME flight we tried booking at the very beginning of the phone call. Absolutely horrible experience.  Needless to say we did not book through them after spending 2 hours on the phone and STILL not sorting out why I was charged $400+ with no flight record; we instead book our flight in a matter of 15 minutes through a different company. I will NEVER again try working with this company, and I would definitely not recommend anyone else to go through the hassle. What a poorly run company, with absolutely no integrity.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

I am about to leave $100 in points on the table so I never need to deal with this company again. Everyone I know will hear about this, and anywhere I can post this negative review I will. These companies get too big and don't care about service anymore. This is the only other way I could think to send my feedback where someone in your company may actually read it.

1428	"            Let me first start out by saying this is the first time I have ever used Expedia. I never in my wildest imagination envisioned having such a bad experience. I booked tickets for myself, my husband and our two kids to travel for my sisters graduation. That being said you can see why it is so important to me to make the flights and ensure everything goes smoothly so we make this event. My husband can not make the trip. I had already anticipated him having to work so I purchased insurance. I called the Customer Service line to make this change, also to add another family member on to the flight. The automated system did not recognize any of my itinerary information and I had to wait again and again, as I was forwarded from menu to menu to simply get a customer service agent. I was told by the customer service agent that the changes could be made with no issues by customer service agent Edwin. I was then placed on hold, several time in which I heard the associate joking around and singing with other workers. I was on hold for at least 15 minutes. The associate then said he couldn't find seats available on the same flight. As he had already said he could make the changes and promised me a smooth exchange I was upset. If I was simply exchanging one name for another you would imaging them simply being able to use the same ticket. The associate then said he would see what he could do to resolve the issue.He stated that they could return the tickets and place a credit on the account, mind you he never stated the ticket credit would have any sort of expiration or limitation.  I was pleased and explained that I would like to use the credit to add my family member to our same flights. Then Edwin said he could not help as he could only use the credit towards future flights for my husband. I dont need a flight for my husband. As I explained several times to the rep my husband could not make the flight and I needed someone to take his place. The associate said he would place me on hold to find out more information, after he already told me could help then changed his mind? That call was then ""disconnected"" ( I say ""disconnected"" as I was boldly hung up on after this) I called back and told that there were NO notes regarding my previous conversation. I had to then speak to another customer service agent who refused to even review the notes on file. I asked to speak so a supervisor or management. I was told i was being transferred. I held the phone ""on hold"" for 20 minutes. During which I took it upon myself to call back on another line as I assume I was hung up on yet again. I called back for the 3rd time and spoke to a 3rd associate (john) who again stated that there were no notes on my file regarding any of my previous calls or inquires. I explained the situation yet again and let the associate know that I was supposed to have been transferred to management but was still on hold on another line. He apologized and transferred me. The manager or supervisor picked up immediately which enforces the fact that I was hung up on previously. The Manager, Nina M stated that there were no notes on file and I had to review my concerns and explained again what I needed to be done. To begin with Nina M had an attitude and a very snarky tone. After about an hour of talking Nina saying there was no way they could help me and stating that I needed to file a claim with the insurance, which she would not give me the number to, she finally said she could switch the passenger names for our first flight and let me know there would only be a name change fee of $125. I was tired of being on the phone with such bad customer service and just wanted to have a resolution so I agreed to pay the name change fee. However, Nina M offered no solution for our returning flight. She stated that she could not do a name change for the second flight as that particular airline had a different policy. That was fine, I mentioned that the new family member I wanted to add would like to return a day prior to myself and my children. I asked if they could give a refund for the ticket for the second flight and purchase a new one for the day before. She said they could. Then she said that I would need to contact the insurance to get a refund. I asked her about the insurance/refund process. She had no answers. She gave no number or no way to reach the insurance and simply said "" I can not guarantee they will give you your refund"". I let her know several times that I needed some sort of solution of guide to resolving the issue or getting ahold of the insurance she continued to restate the policy over and over, but did not give me any information on contacting the insurance or any information as far as who to speak to, how long a claim would take or even if they would be able to refund me. She then said she was going back on the notes, note that she claimed in the beginning of the call did not exist. I asked why the notes were not reviewed initially to which I received attitude. I asked several times for an option or a way to help get a returning flight home. She simply repeated 'contact the insurance to get a refund"" but again offered no way of getting ahold of the insurance or any information that would help me resolve the issue and simply said ""thats the policy"" She then proceeded to repeat her self and say that I I should call in the morning if I dont like the way she helps. I asked to speak with another supervisor or manager to which she responded she was the only person unless I called the following day. I let her know several times that I had been on the phone for HOURS with Expedia being transferred and hung up on and having no resolution and just wanted someone to help she ended up ""releasing the call"" as I was asking again for the insurance information so I could file a claim or find out if that was even possible as she again gave me zero information. After being hung up on yet again, I called back at 12:20am again the automated system did not recognize any of my information or the itinerary number. Alistir picked up and asked for my information, after which I let him know I had called several times and there should be notes on the issue so hopefully I could be transferred to management without issue. Again I was told there were no notes on file. No one in the 3 hours I spent calling and talking to agent after agent took notes? Alistir insisted he could assist me without needing to transfer me to management. I went over the fact that my husband could not make our flight and that I needed to have someone take his place. He then informed me that he could not do name change even for a fee for our first flight, even thought the manager had just told me she could. He let me know that all he could do was refund the rickets for a credit which would be under my husbands name and could only be used by him and expired in a matter of months. I let him know that management had advised me otherwise and asked to speak with management again. I was then transferred to Lety. Lety went ahead and said she could do the name change for my first flight at the name change fee of $125 then she added a rebooking/ difference in fare fee which was NEVER mentioned previously. I let her know that the previous manager i spoke to made no mention of this fee and agreed to charge me only the name change fee. Lety insisted this was the policy, which frankly at this point was alittle hard to believe as I had spoken now to 5 other associates who all had a different explanation and take on their policy. Lety insisted that I call the insurance regarding the refund but again did not give me any information as to how to reach them. I had now dealt with 6 associates. No one offered any real solution or answer and everyone had a different take on the policy. I was originally promised that I could easily change the names on the flights and spent over 4 hours back and forth on the phone, on hold and being hung up on. I finally received the insurance information and was also given the airline companies contact info and told they could assist me further. This, after ever agent before Lety said the airline could not assist me as I booked with Expedia. Again, everyone had a different answer and NO one had a solution. I am beyond upset and disappointed with Expedia and the lack of compassion each and every one of their customer service agents displayed. I wasted over 4 hours of my time and am left with nothing more than a very bad experience.  I asked several times for the corporate number or email and was told that information is not given our to customers. I was told that I would have to call the automated system AGAIN, be transferred to a customer service agent AGAIN, ask for the call to be escalated to management AGAIN and then ask management to escalate the call to corporate. I need a solution. Instead I got attitude, misinformation and no help.        "	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative

I'm never allowed to talk with a supervisor... One of those supposed agent told me that him and the probably invisible or inadible supervisor did spoke with my bank and that they were not able to do a phone conference with me and the bank.He (he's name NED) hang up, i called my bank wich told me that they never been contacted by any one from expedia.com nor travel reservation. Also that they have more bad news, another withdrawal  of $1000... were made today after i made the first call...I don't know what do about it        	                3	1	Monday	expedia	negative
1430	"            I booked a hotel 2 months ago for a one night stay in San Diego. As I arrive to check into my hotel, I quickly learn that it has been SHUT DOWN and that I had already been charged.I call Expedia to fix the situation, and I somehow allowed them to take me on and off hold for 2 hours as they try to find me a new place to stay ""free of charge"". Instead of crediting my account, they charged me $176 to stay at a Best Western. I didn't get my refund on the hotel that no longer exists and had to tell them specifically what hotels had available rooms. They tried to book a room far away from my destination, and then tried to book a hotel with one twin-sized bed for 2 adults. I've never experienced such poor customer service and will never book through Expedia again. I only wish I had those 2 hours of my life and money back.

1431	            Realized w/in hours of booking a trip I did not need travel insurance as I had it free via my credit card. Expedia says can cancel w/in 24 hours, so I contacted them and they refused to cancel the insurance. They offered I could cancel the entire trip but not the insurance and if that I did that the rates were no longer available.  I knew this was wrong as you have 3 days to cancel a contract in almost every state. I spoke to 3 tiers of management and they all said they would not cancel the insurance. I figured out the company that writes the insurance policies, they were nice and said I had 10 days to cancel and they took care of it. Expedia out and out told me a lie - why would I ever want to do business w/ them again?        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative

1434	            I bought a direct flight ticket for 4 people at full price. A few days later, the price went down and we did not get a credit or a refund for the difference of price although it does say on the website that expedia offers price guarantee. Also, a few days before our flight, they changed our flight from a direct flight to a layover flight. we called to ask them to change our flight or refund us cause clearly the 2 types of flights have completely different prices, but expedia's incompetent workers were unable to do anything and making us lose even more money... We chose expedia thinking they offered good prices and good services, but we were completely wrong. Calling 2 days before getting an answer is also one of expedia's problems. this is the last time I'm buying my tickets on expedia and i don't recommend anyone to buy from expedia.        	                2	1	Friday	expedia	negative

I called Expedia to cancel the booking due to the fact that I couldn't reach the hotel , so its faster with epedia cos they were my agency . Epedia called me to confirm that the booking was canceled and I have no worries about extra fees . only for me to figure out the the booking wasn't canceled, and not only that , the Hotel chargede $109 . I called Expedia cos I was so upset about the fee...Expedia ignored my concerns and refused to help me. They cleared my history with them .

1437	"            SO I got a flight for BNA to MNL and paid for it before. However in the airport, I got my bags checked in and my boarding pass issued - meaning I'm already in and ready to fly.But due to the traffic in TSA checkpoints, I missed my flight. Now, it should be a prerogative of a reputable company such as EXPEDIA to provide rerouting or rebooking on a immediate manner in accordance with the policy. The whole scenario was accidental, and the customer is not at fault for missing that flight, PLUS I got a proof that I'm checked in because I HAVE MY BOARDING PASS.Unfortunately, after I missed the flight, DELTA airlines was much obliged to help me reroute but due to EXPEDIA being my travel ticket provider, I need to call EXPEDIA instead and have it reroute for me to DELTA and PAL.So, I thought the nightmare has ended, I was wrong.... it just started - I kept on calling EXPEDIA for almost 12 hours already! 12 DAMN HOURS! for a rerouting of my flight. With almost 20+ agents and 4 supervisors, they couldn't book one single reroute for BNA to MNL?How hard could that be? well, other than the fact I was on hold for 12 hours, I also missed the opportunity to get an earlier flight later that day because of their incompetent customer service (always on Hold, then when you get disconnected, you will have to start another booking inquiry) and their going back and forth to PAL and DELTA to have DEAL they said.I was left in the dark literally because I am still at the airport 1130 PM!, and the DELTA personnel still didn't help me either. BECAUSE EXPEDIA SAID THEY WILL COORDINATE WITH DELTA, and I was foolish to believe that.Imagine, they even booked a rerouting for SFO to MNL later on, BUT WITHOUT the flight from BNA to SFO. On which case they cancelled the flight themselves, so another ""not the customer's fault""  scenario happened again.I have proof of everything, their rerouting incompetence because I have a copy of the error they made for SFO and BNA. Then I also have m boarding pass saying that this is not a ""no show"".So as far as consumer rights is concerned, there should be a protection for us consumers about this unscrupulous policies that deny our right for compensation or refund if such accidental things happen. Isn't that why we have a compensation regulation?isn't it also the reason why WE HAVE TO BE REROUTED IMMEDIATELY once we missed our flight? That was the policy!So they broke it themselves and did not do their due for their bargain. Is it still the fault of the customer? Absolutely, NOT.That's why I filed a complaint already, and now also have a dispute with my card that I used. Because even my card representative said that this is NOT RIGHT because the ticket wasn't even used and now they will also leave their customer up in air.GOOD JOB EXPEDIA, we'll just see how FTC looks this up.*** I HAVE MY BOARDING PASS, BAGGAGE SLIP, ITINERARY CHANGES THAT DELTA AND EXPEDIA MADE, as a proof of their lack of consideration for fair customers like us.I hope somebody could help me out, but now, I'm on my way to another flight with a $1,091 additional ticket. My finances are now ruined because of expedia. I hope you have a goodnight sleep for all of this mess you did with a customer.        "	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative
1438	"            I usually never write reviews, but Expedia is so s**t I just have to get the word out there and hopefully prevent others from experiencing the same as us.I would ABSOLUTELY NOT recommend Expedia under any circumstances. I would advice you to go straight to the flight company or hotel, as the customer service is awful, the staff is untrained and not helpful at all. We've just tried to change our tickets, and we talked to 5 different staff giving us 5 different prices ranging from $200 to $7000. When we said we wanted to go for the option of $200, the said that ""Oh you can't do that after all my supervisor just told me"". That was after giving her our credit card details. What a shocking customer service. We've been on the phone for over 4 hours with you guys the last couple of days, and for every person at Expedia we talked to we gave us a different answer to our enquiry. All we want is to change the date of our two tickets. We've talked with Emirates, and they've given us the green light to change the flight for a fee and that there's tickets available, but it has to go through you (Expedia) as that's where we bought the tickets.Having 5 different staff giving us 5 different explanations and five prices is NOT good enough. Expedia obviously lack training of their staff as the message we got is not consistent. The prices given ranged from $200 to a chocking $7000(!!!). Unbelievable!! Another staff of yours said that our tickets are non changeable. This is when we contacted Emirates and they told us that what you said was non-sense, and that we had to contact you again telling you that Emirates had both checked prices and availability for our preferred dates.We are still not able to get a clear answer from any of the Expedia staff, and I'm now concerned we won't be able to get any help from you at all. I hope that one of you reading this can contact us to sort out this minor problem that should not take much time at all. I will never ever travel through Expedia again. Neither will my family.

They were aware of the duplicate booking as they had cancelled the duplicate flights but failed to cancel the duplicate charges. After nearly three hours on the phone, I could not get Expedia to admit that they were in error or how they were going to refund my money once I told them that I cancelled my credit card when I saw the duplicate charge as I suspected fraud (and maybe I was right!). The supervisor, when I asked whether it was my fault had the temerity to reply ""We'll give you he benefit of the doubt"". How magnanimous of him!

1442	"            I traveled with United Airlines to Cozumel Mexico on April 25, 2015 for my daughters wedding and I have to say I will NEVER use United again.  They re-routed my flight due to weather which I understand, but when I landed, I missed my connecting flight, so I was put on standby and I sat at the gate for 3 hours,  I was the first and only person at the gate for almost 2 hours.  When they started calling people's names from the standby list, I was not chosen,  when I asked why and how they chose the standby I was told they chose the ""preimer customers"" first. Here is the deal,  I don't fly often, so I am no ones ""premier"" customer and I CHOSE THEM, they didn't choose me.   Well that was the last flight of the day.  While I was sitting there waiting to be called,  a connecting flight from Ontario was just getting into their gate and the lady behind the desk told a co-worker there was no way anyone from that flight would be able to that flight so they bumped everyone,  one couple did make it and their seats were already gone.  So I had to take a flight into Cancun, take a taxi to the ferry and that cost me another $100 dollars.  When I got to Cozumel I went to the airport and I had no bag.  Sunday April 26th I called United and they said there was only one flight and it had left but they did not send my bag because the bag area was full. All my daily medicine was in that bag.  So I called again Monday the 27th and they advised me my bag was on the flight and they would have it delivered by 12:30.  About 15 minutes later the bellhop called my room and advised my bag was in the lobby.  That means my bag was there probably the whole time.  When I got my bag,  there was a big rip in it and 2 items that I had bought for my daughter's wedding was gone.  A pair of lacy panties and perfume.  I will NEVER NEVER NEVER use that airline again.   The only plus side is the lady behind the desk felt bad I guess and put me in 1st class to Cancun.

1443	            I don't know how this company survives. Do not book a holiday with them!I have spent hours and hours and hours on the phone with them with no effect. I never get the same operator very rarely do I get a supervisor and they NEVER ring back when they say they will. We were told a hotel of our choice was full, IT WAS NOT and WAS NOT for weeks after our booking. We were persuaded to book a hotel NEAR BY. It was not in the same town. Tried to change just two hours after booking. MY bank could not stop the payment. Expedia took a card charge on my DEBIT card which should have been free. They would not let me change hotel and would not let me cancel. They did eventually offer me £25 in vouchers as compensation!! I would NEVER book with them so vouchers were of no use to me at all. On raising my voice they did say they would send me £50 cash but it never arrived.This company has ruined a holiday for us before we get there.        	                8	1	Sunday	expedia	negative

1445	            MarilynI booked hotel accomodation with Expedia 8 days ago on the day that I was supposed to be checking -in  I received a notice that I should contact a toll free number because the hotel has been overbooked. I called the number and share my information with the representative who said that she would assist me in  getting  accomodation at another hotel. I was on the telephone on hold for 2 hours with the rep going in and out of the call. She finally got me a room but then said that I have to pay for the room up front and there was a deposit fee  that would be refunded. I explain that I had never been asked to pay up front and furthermore I always give a credit card to book and pay by debit upon leaving the hotel . I asked to speak to a supervisor whose said her name was Marj and she confirmed that it was payment up front because it is a private apartment. I was concerned that I would be stuck with a bill if the place was not to my liking. After being on the phone now 2 1/2 hr I was then passed on to a private apartment owner who was now telling me pay upfront and then I would receive the code and other information to get into the apartment plus a $350 deposit that would be returned. I declined and was now left with no accomodation for my convention that is 3 days in the city. Bad Business and very Untrustworthy.

When I got to the end it said ""while you were booking your price changed"" and it was magically a few hundred more dollars. I phoned customer service and the customer service rep told me they were having issues with airline prices updating. He asked me in detail for my itinerary and told me if I tried again in three hours it should be fixed and I could get the original price. Tried again in three hours and tried using the itinerary he made for me. He got the wrong flight times and wrong amount of people. Phoned in again this time speaking to another customer service person who apologized. He took all my details full names of all the passengers. I confirmed the price 3 times. He took my credit card info and right before he rang it through he told me as a side note ""oh your price has gone up, but don't worry it's only an extra 60 a person"".

1447	            I was shopping for a flight from YYC to LGA and was initially happy to find several options for $450 (which is the regular fare and it is reasonable). However, when I tried to book it an error message informed me that the price has changed (blaming the airline for changing it while I was booking). The updated price was a hefty $1300! I repeatedly tried to start from scratch, tried different combinations, flights, airlines, etc. Every time the price would shoot up by more than double. This is looking more and more like false advertising. I understand that the airline changes prices on a whim, but Expedia is in no hurry to update their posted prices - they took several hours to do so. In the meantime, you think you will get the posted price, maybe make some plans, maybe book a hotel.. and then, surprise, they ask for more, always more, it's never less. I would not recommend booking anything on expedia. There are other websites out there, and if you really see a good deal, maybe look it up on the airline's own website.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive

1449	            When I bought the protection, Expedia reps swore by it saying they will cover many things including sickness etc etc. When I had to cancel my flight due to sickned they tried to brush me off at first. They gave a number to call for Berkley Care which is run by AON, I called them and they told me yup you qualify for a reimbursement but you have to call Expedia bc they will be reimbursing you not us. So I did, and then of course Expedia tells me the same thing AON told me except it's always the other party who has to reimburse me. Finally, I was able to reach someone at AON who took down some info an said I need to fill out a form by my Dr, but the catch is they will email me the form 2 days later. So I asked why 2 days since it is not regular mail and since I may no longer be sick by the time I get my form and see my Dr, after. No explanation given. This whole thing is designed for you to lose your money and never get reimbursed for anything. And for Expedia to be promoting their service to their customers is not right and Expedia should be responsible for this false advertising. I finally received the forms, aside from having my Dr. fill out the forms they ALSO WANT FULL ACCESS TO MY ENTIRE MEDICAL RECORDS EVEN PRIOR TO THE TRIP FOR UP TO ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE SIGNED!! This was the biggest waste of my money and it is the last time I EVER deal with Expedia. They can take all the points I accumulated over the years and shove them.

1452	            We have previously used Expedia for overseas bookings and had no problems, but our most recent experience has revealed that when things go wrong they don't get fixed.We booked an apartment at the Ibis Styles Lake Hume Resort, near Albury in New South Wales, Australia.  The booking was confirmed by email, but when we rang Ibis a week before departure we were told that the apartment was not available and we would be in a cottage instead.  Sounds delightful and we were assured that it was.To cut a long story short, the accommodation was inferior, unsuitable and unsafe for my elderly mother-in-law. We got a partial refund due to the lower cost of the cottage (old cabin), but not from Expedia who kept their booking fee - about 15%.  Ibis Styles staff tried to address our issues, but had not been given our contact details and could not advise us in advance of the change.  Expedia were supposed to contact us about the change, but didn't.  We complained by phone after, but the representative in India did not appear to appreciate the issues.  We also filled in a feedback form with very clear details, but no response.In short, Expedia did not deliver the service we paid for and will not be held accountable for their stuff up.Never again.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1453	"            I have been a member of Expedia since 2012 and have booked most air travel and a few hotel trips through them. As a member I was sent a monthly rewards statement. For the past three years, the monthly statements including the latest March 2015 one said I had almost 5,000 reward points. I even received an email that I was eligible for a $ amount reward on a hotel stay. When I proceeded to redeem this reward, the Expedia site told me I didn't have enough points. Upon checking my travel history and related points, it showed that I only had 188 pending points for an incomplete roundtrip. After numerous calls, 45 minute - 1 hour holds, dropped calls as I was transferred to a ""supervisor"", I was told they have no record of my 4,986 points or even the trips associated with those points. When they researched further, they found two of these trips and said they could only give me 1,157 points based on their current rewards of one point for each $5 dollar spent. This is all they could do for me after wasted hours on the phone to Expedia, most of which were long holds and dropped calls. I even asked a few of the operators to take down my number in case my call was dropped because I waited so long just to hear a human voice. Each time they took my number and assured me it will not be dropped or they will call me back. Of course, no such promises were kept and I ended up with a brand new person who needed to hear the whole history again. It has been very frustrating dealing with Expedia, whose customer call center reps are located out of the country as confirmed by some of the reps I spoke with. Being way across the other side of the world, I get the feeling these reps couldn't care less whether my issues are properly addressed or not. Otherwise, how could they just say there's nothing else they could do when it's a matter of misleading reporting for three years!!!  Use some other travel site who is honest and does not misrepresent, a company that will correct their properly errors if necessary with staff that are capable of doing so.

My Co-operative debit card account was charged for BOTH for itineraries 112410202988 and -- 112413301264 by a different company (Hahn Air) at a total of £4409.00 Stg  plus my bank charges .Due to the confusion and doubt about the validity of either of the tickets issued and charged for, I cancelled both itineraries by email to Expedia on 12 Feb and by telephone on 11 March, 20th March and 23rd March.     On 23rd March, Virgin emailed to say that no cancellations had been received despite my requests to Expedia.  My emails to Virgin also asked them to cancel bookings  didn’t trigger the cancellation either.  Expedia, Virgin and Hahn Air all failed to notice that 2 people were booked in twice on the same flight.  Virgin Atlantic (23 March) and Hahn air (19 Feb &amp;  7 April  say they are not responsible for issuing refunds and Expedia (Mar 3) advise that  I must claim the refund from Virgin Atlantic.  These two reservations were cancelled by me via Expedia and Virgin Atlantic weeks before the were cancelled by me weeks before the scheduled flight on 11th April, ample time for the seats to be sold and incurring no loss on the part of the 3 companies involved.The attached exchange of emails and telephone calls to Expedia, Virgin and Hahn Air  describe the ensuing  frustration of trying  to cancel both bookings due to the uncertainty and confusion.  This meant also cancelling my intended flight from Bangkok to Hong Kong prior to returning to LHR..  . Strenuous efforts to get this situation sorted left me with 4 tickets instead of two on the same plane and so far, no refundFailure of DUTY OF CARE.- Expedia,  Virgin Atlantic and Hahn Air share are all sullied by this complaint.Neither Virgin Atlantic, Hahn Air nor Expedia noticed that two seats had been booked twice on the same flight for the same two passengers .and Hahn Air charged my debit card  but say than cannot issue a refund.I  am seeking a FULL REFUND of GBP 4409 and even if I receive this I will lose money due to having to cancel my flight to Hong Kong from which I intended to fly to the UK.

1457	"            I attempted to book a packaged flight and hotel for a trip from Tampa to Jamaica for July, 2015. For whatever reason, the trip was billed to my credit card twice and therefore not approved by my bank; however the cost of the trip is now a pending charge (on hold) on my credit card. After spending 3 1/2 hours on the phone last Saturday (my average hold time for each call back after being {intentionally} disconnected three times was 56 minutes) I was told that a ""different"" department, apparently a billing department, had to ""release"" the pending charges on my credit card, and that would take place the following business day, which was a Monday. The release hasn't happened yet, but after having both my bank and Expedia on the telephone a few minutes after the initial problem happened last week, I don't understand why Expedia couldn't correct this situation right away. I have no reservations at this point, the flights are about to be sold out, and the hotel no longer has rooms available. This was intended to be a trip with three other couples. None of them booked through Expedia. None of them had a problem. I now have an additional sum of almost $3,000 deducted from the available credit on my credit card, and based on the attitude of the first three people I tried to talk to at Expedia, they have absolutely no interest in correcting this situation.As a consumer, I find this matter to be absolutely unacceptable. I suggest you think twice before using Expedia, or entering any personal or financial information into their system.        "	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1458	            I got the Expedia sales person to promise me time and time again that the advertised price for my return ticket to the Philippines was the correct price with no extra fees or anything whatsoever. Having taken his word I said I would like to proceed and pay. Within a minute the very same Expedia sales person said there was now a thirty dollar surcharge on top of what was on the screen.I just hung up and ordered the ticket on line with Cathay Pacific for the same advertised price. Easy to do so I will never ever trust Expedia or use them again.Expedia also argued over price matching with others far cheaper on Trivago for a lower price for the same room. So I have now gone through Flight Centre who actually do their very best to price match. It looks like Flight Centre may save me about $380 for the same deal.Bye bye Expedia I will always use your site for information but I will NEVER EVER place an order with you again.I regret to say there is not a score low enough on this or any other site to indicate what I think of Expedia.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	neutral

We received a call on March 18th saying they could not accommodate us due to pipe break. I called expedia letting them know they screwed up. They changed it with hotel they said and we received confirmation. On arrival at 10 pm the hotel did not have our reservation. They were booked solid. This hotel btw is very very nice. Expedia could not find us a hotel nearby so we travel 14 miles to a hotel that was fill of roaches.

1461	            This is the worst service!Each time I've made hotel accommodations, I've found that this company is useless.The most recent incident occurred just this weekend. I had a two day stay booked at the Candlewood Suites Birmingham -Hoover location. I prepaid the reservation.I did not check into the hotel at all, and both Expedia and the Candlewood Suites refused to refund the money I prepaid. Yes, both companies pocketed my prepaid stay without providing, a service.Last time I'd ever consider Candlewood, last time I'll ever use Expedia. I plan on sharing this information with all of my consultant friends and Human Resources department as well.It may not ruin either company, but it will notify others of the total disregard for decency and common courtesy.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	positive
1462	            My boyfriend and I booked a package resort vacation to Cancun, Mexico (this includes flight + resort). The traveling dates were April 2, 2015 - April 6th, 2015. Upon reaching the resort we were notified that we did not have a reservation for the night of the 2nd and our hotel stay started on the 3rd. We were stranded in the middle of Mexico because Expedia could not issue our tickets properly and given that this is a packaged deal, the error was not on our part. Upon speaking to multiple representatives for nearly 2 hours, we were told that they would not reimburse us for the one night stay which costed us $350, but will give us $200 in our account. Now I am once again on hold with Expedia hours trying to locate the $200. There is absolutely no record of my conversation on April 2nd and have to go through this experience all over again. I have never had a worse experience but out of principle need that $200 (which requires me to further book with Expedia to use).        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	neutral
1463	            I booked a flight that was advertised on Expedia website this evening. The flight is from Kingston,Jamaica to New York on Caribbean airlines and return on JetBlue . The advertisement stated that they had only four seats left for 445.30 + Expedia booking fee of 7.00 inclusive of taxes. I went ahead and booked the flight but was called an hour later from someone at Expedia saying that those two airlines do not operate together. I asked the lady why was it being advertised on the site and she said they at Expedia have no control over what the airlines put on their site and they cannot do nothing about it. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told all the supervisors were in a meeting.I asked to cancel the reservations and was told I would not get the money back on my card until 72 hrs. Now this is a big inconvenience to me as I now have to wait three days for the money to go back on my card, and of course the fares are going up while I wait. The rep who does not speak much English did not empathized or take responsibility for the false advertising on their part or try to resolved the issue.What I am saying is that the ad showed that they had only 4 seats left so didn't Expedia knew before I booked that those two airlines do not operate together? Come on , the plane is almost full, with only four seats left, so what happen to the other 100 and odd people who already purchased the same flight before me? This is just BS!!!!!! I will never booked with Expedia ever again, PEOPLE PLEASE BE WARNED, Expedia is ADVERTISING FALSE FLIGHT INFORMATION AND Fooling US!!!!!!! And the customer service is Horrible, all they can tell you is hey have nothing to do with what the airlines post on their site. Yea right..        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1464	"            I just booked, and then cancelled a hotel in San Francisco for September when a friend of ours is coming to visit the US.I haven't used Expedia very often and I don't believe we have booked hotels previously.When looking at the hotel booking total it says above the amount that you will be charged ""no hidden charges/surprises"" (not sure at this moment whether it said charges or surprises!) and gives the hotel amount and then the tax and fee amount.  I did not click the button to check on the explanation of the taxes and fees, presuming after Expedia's claim that the total was the full amount that we would have to pay.When looking at my confirmation I find that the 'taxes and fees"" are those charged by Expedia and yes, there would be another tax of 14% + city taxes of 2.5%, making a $250 additional charge.If they truly mean, no hidden charges, they need to put that information right where they advertise that you won't be gettng a surprise.It's possible that most Americans are very aware of this but I'm not sure about those from the UK or Europe.Not happy!After getting the confirmation        "	                4	1	Sunday	expedia	positive
1465	            I ordered a stay at the Comfort Inn in Pawtucket, RI. When I showed up to my room there were live electrical wires and an electrical box on the floor near the AC unit. I went downstairs to notify the front desk and they immediately changed my room. The next night, I went to turn on the TV and there was static on every channel and the wireless internet would not work. I went down to the front desk again to have a change in rooms then called Expedia.  Expedia basically did nothing and only offered me $50 back.  That is not okay with leaving a fire hazard on the floor - absolutely unacceptable.  If I were Expedia I would have dropped this hotel in a heart beat but they are still standing by them.  How can they run a business like this.  I have booked rooms through Hotwire that had issues that weren't half as bad as this and was refunded the entire amount.

I arrived to the hotel (after 13 hours of travel changing planes!) at 3:40am with two little kids and found out my check in time will be next day at 3pm!!! they haven't had any rooms that are clean because expedia has booked it starting the next day, while on my confirmation printout from expedia was showing that my room is guaranteed for late check in. Obviously I assumed 3:40am is a late night check in time! They should have some red alert showing ""do you realize that you won't have any place to go to for the next 12h plus consider it's a night time!"", but they haven't had any, only the information that mistakenly made me think I will be ok with late night arrival… I have contacted customer service and both, the representative and then his supervisor have been very rude and did not care at all! I was leaving friday and the check out was set up to be on Saturday. Not only that at the end, when I arrived earlier, and finally after 2h I was given a room, for which I was charged extra, I also was charged for the night I haven't need as I was already sitting in the plane to get back home. I will never again purchase any travel from expedia!!! Also, I was suppose to get 4K+ reward points for my travel and one month after the trip those are still pending so I cannot redeem them.

1469	            This is the email I just sent Expedia that explains what has just happened and reason for my rating:This morning, at 6:42 a.m. (PST) I called expedia to book a package to Puerto Vallarta at the Sheraton Bungavilias with an Ocean Room all inclusive from July 26-31st.  I had booked the same exact package last night, but realized that I  had booked the wrong dates. SO I decided to call and book the new package before cancelling the one from last night so that I could lock in a good price.  I spoke with an agent by the name of Vincent. I told him the package I wanted and he gave me a price of $1872 for an all-inclusive ocean front from the 26th to the 31st.  I asked if he could include in the notes that I would be celebrating my 30th birthday and my boyfriend and my first vacation together in 10 years and that any complimentary upgrades would be appreciated.  He then put me on hold. When he came back he said, I was able to reduce the price of your flight so how does a package of $1506 sound? I said that sounds amazing.  He then proceeded to say, in addition to this I have upgraded your room to a club level. I asked if it was all inclusive as well and he said that it was.  He said I was a valued Expedia member and he was only allowed a few of these upgrades.  I was ecstatic to say the least. I thanked him over and over.  When I got off the phone with him, I noticed that the room was NOT all-inclusive like the agent said. I've now been on the phone for 6 hours with expedia (still on hold) and have not resolved this issue.  I spoke with 2 supervisors, 1 by the name of April who promised to resolve this and give me a call by the end of the day, she said she would PERSONALLY resolve this.  I have yet to hear back and that was at 8:38 this morning.  I have a migraine, my train to get home has left for the day, and I'm scared to use the restroom for fear that after waiting for an hour and a half, someone might answer my call.  I've used expedia for years, I however, am disappointed to see that this is how your customer service works.  I'm literally at the point of tears with frustration. I would appreciate a call back before my 24 hours to cancel is up tomorrow morning at 6 a.m.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	positive

They offer you exactly the same price as in their website. They make you believe you have a chance to get that super deal, but when you try to book it, you see only regular rates.Since I am so tired of it, I took my time to call them and say hey either you guys offer me what you are saying you are offering, or just stop sending me this kind of e-mails. Because it's really frustrating !!!!I wasted 1 hour and 5 minutes of my time for nothing!!!!!!!Bad customer services, they said one day (she didn't know when) they will send me another e-mail like that and hopefully it would work... excuse me????She asked me if I wanted to talk to her supervisor, obviously I was spending my time on the phone to talk to someone who couldn't help me.

I contacted the airline directly, United, who told me had I bought the ticket directly from them, they would have been able to give me a travel voucher for the difference, but as I got the ticket from an agent, there was nothing they could do.  I'm on hold now with Expedia, waiting to talk to a manager, but I've been on hold waiting for either the first rep or now the manager for 70 minutes, then the line cut.  Ironically their call-back service called me back after 1.5 hours and I'm once again waiting for a manager.  I'm sure I won't get anywhere with them and that's a lot of time I won't get back.  I've had time to call United from my other line and write 3 reviews now.  Bottom line, don't use Expedia!  Book directly with the airline.  If there are any issues, you'll get through to the airline much faster, and they will provide much better customer service.

I had to scramble to find another room, and called Expedia the next day to get a refund. Forward six months and a whole lot of frustration. Five calls with expedia, not one bit of help. Hung up on, left on hold for ungodly lengths, and two failed promises to call back. I eventually tried to dispute the charges with my credit union.

1479	            I always thought Expedia is an international company with best deals but I was wrong!My recent flight booking was full of frustration. The mobile app does not state currency at all and the transaction process is flawed. Hence I was charged USD 442 instead of SGD 442, the currency of my original Singapore setting. To make matters worse contacting Expedia customer service was a waste of my time. It is not international as each country is individually run. Local office cannot help you should your booking be automatically switched to USA site. I corresponded via emails, called the USA call center. Repeated my case to at least five Expedia staff. After two hours on the phone, it was back to square one. They did not want to take responsibility or help. Just repeated the same defensive and irresponsible answer. Is this the excellent service your marketing campaign claims to provide?I now have to seek other avenues to address this injustice. Expedia staff Marley was rude and wrong to comment the penalty fee was expensive for me. I refuse to pay penalty because I am not in the wrong. Not because I cannot afford it. It is a matter of principle.Travel enthusiasts like me Please be warned! Use other Flight apps for booking. Avoid using Expedia mobile app, Which does not indicate any currency upon checkout.

1481	            Earlier in the week I used Expedia to compare hotel rates in the Atlantic City area. A friend and I were attending a concert- both of us are 19 years old. I was running into trouble finding a hotel that would book to anyone under 21 but came across a hotel on Expedia's site that was advertised as booking to 18 and over. I called Expedia to double check this policy as I did not want to run into any problems when checking in. The employee on the phone put me on hold and came back stating that this specific hotel did in fact book to adults over 18. We got to the hotel following the concert at 12:30 am and were told we could not check in because we were under 21. The manager said there was nothing he could do and that Expedia has had communication problems in the past. We tried contacting Expedia to find out if we could get our money back before making an hour and a half trip home but the wait time was estimated to be an hour long before we could speak to a representative. Additionally, they told the hotel we booked 2 hotel rooms when we received confirmation showing that we only booked one. Miscommunication from Expedia led to a big headache following the concert. I will never again use Expedia.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

Today when I called in regards of an e-mail, I was told that my waiting time was two and a half hours before an available representative would be with me. After opting for a call back which lasted three hours, the available representative had no clue of how or what he was doing. I spent over ten minutes waiting on him to find out if he was going to be able and help me out but it was time wasted. I then request for him to transfer me to one of his supervisors. He agree to do so and put me on hold for over twenty minutes. It is hard for me to believe that it really takes that long for a phone transfer inside the same department. To all this I was never transfer to any one and shortly after the 7th song played in the background while waiting my call was ened by some one without speaking to me.

I noticed this in January 2015 and called Expedia. After 45min. on the phone they told me that they contacted the hotel, confirmed the double payment and said money will be reimbursed shortly.

Expedia said they will take care.Hang-up. 2 weeks later I follow up again. Nothing happened. Ask for supervisor (March). She told me that she will take care and keep me in their email communication loop (cc) with the hotel. Never received any email. Just now called again the 5th time and mentioned that I will quite Expedia if nobody helps here. Supervisor (Marissa) called hotel again. Nobody speaks English she said. Sorry. Supervisor offered 50$ coupon. I said I don't need the coupon but will quite my account with Expedia. Then she just asked whether I have any other request and said good by. Such a bad customer support service I have never experienced. I am done with Expedia. I just called the hotel myself to get  back my money. The person who answered spoke perfect English and was very helpful. Forget Expedia.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	positive

1488	"            I used Expedia for over 18 years. In the first years I don't have nothing to complain, but for the last 6 or so years their service had being going down the hill. I'm no a racist person, but about 2 years ago I have one of the worst experiences, dealing with ""costumer service"". I will no provide details for a too long story. In short, I have problems with people that barely can speak or understand English. In my last trip, I have to talk to 4 persons, all these taking about 3 days, and explain all over again my situation to each person. Each of them have a particular and wrong way for fix my request-canceling and booking another flight.Finally A got help from a English native speaker lady. But the experience was awful. I just decide for the future to do my dealings with other business in the industry. Expedia has too many problems and seem that they are unable to fix them.

1489	            Be well aware when using this company and my advice would be do not use at all. Their website is full of errors and makes bookings on dates you do not specify and you are not aware of this until you confirm and pay for other dates only to be sent email confirmations for dates that you previously may have enquired about but then later changed. Their customer service team then completely deny any wrongdoing and refuse to ammend their mistakes even if the hotel themselves tell you it is okay to make the change but that they just need a simple email communication from expedia to confirm. I would award zero stars if the option was available. To make matters worse, the change I needed them to make cost the same amount at the same hotel.

Unfortunately (maybe because it was a promotion that was no longer available) we were not able to change the reservation (cancel the last night). They also lack an e-mail contact. Tried to make the change directly with the hotel, with no success. Since I had already paid for it, I was a bit scared by some of the reviews here. Nevertheless, 3 or 4 days later the exact amount I paid was refunded (bear in mind that they inform you that the refund may differ due to exchange rates variation). No complaints here, would book again with them.        "	                2	4	Monday	expedia	negative

Imagine if you showed up for your week long vacation and you didn't have a hotel room for your first night.  When I called Expedia customer service, the woman who barely spoke English, blatantly and openly said ""That is your fault and your problem"".  This happened once before, about three years ago.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  I will NEVER use Expedia again for anything. Their companies include Hotwire.com, Travelocity.com, Hotels.com, and Trivago.com.

Expedia is clearly in the business of nickle and diming customers instead of actually providing a service.  Expedia's clear and calculated policy is to  never, ever give back money, even if the customer has a legitimate claim - In my case,  the $150 refund fee was due back because of a verified and accepted (and really horrible) medical emergency.  The airline (Virgin America) and my credit card co. (Chase Visa) were impeccable.  When it came to dealing with Expedia, the jaw drops at their shoddy, shameless treatment.  Be warned.

Not a word. Silence....I have now sent them the same email through their website 5 times, sent a summary to every email address I can find and guess what? Expedia does its wonderful customer service and does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Silence. So, off to my credit company I go and complain. I will now log Expedia as a fraudulent company, which they are.

Expedia charged my credit card, sent me confirmation emails with E-ticket assurance, itinerary number, follow-up ""You're on your way!"" emails, etc.  When I got to the airport in plenty of time, I could not board.  The airline had no knowledge of my existence.  MANY calls, from that moment forward, got met with being put on hold, being transferred, being put on hold, and then being disconnected.  (This started with United's efforts to contact Expedia, in order to get the necessary info.)  I missed the crucial first flight;   subsequent calls to Expedia for rebooking other (far less convenient) flights for the next day, also got no traction. In the brief moments of not keeping me on hold, Expedia personnel passed the buck to the airlines, which, naturally, told me ""You must contact Expedia, as they issued the ticket.""  Apparently, no ticket was issued.  Because of Expedia's major screw-up,  I missed my pre-paid tour of southern Ethiopia.  My many attempts to resolve this matter with Expedia, via telephone, email, and Certified USPS Mail, have been ignored by Expedia.

Later they said they couldn't do anything about the situation because my purchase was through Expedia. I purchased another flight for my daughter to fly with me on Friday the 6th, when I thought my ticket was. On Friday I found out I had missed my flight the day before. Because my daughter cannot fly alone due to health issues, we had to lose that flight as well. There were no available seats.Because of Expedia I lost two plane tickets, nearly $500.00.I will never work with this company again. There is no literally customer service to help. And they don't even send you an email confirmation of your flight details. You need that email to board the flight, its your proof of purchase.

This whole Expedia experience has cost me £ 465 !!! and Expedia are nowhere to be found to answer the charges.Now they are given me the run-around and I doubt I will ever get my money back .All I can and will do now, is let as many people as possible know about this crooked-outfit! I had never used them before nor of course, will I ever again and I would advise anyone reading this, to seek one of the more reputable companies which offer on-line travel-services and STAY WELL CLEAR OF EXPEDIA.

The booking number did not work on either the Expedia or Hotels.com sites so I couldn't cancel online. I had to wait ten minutes on hold and speak to two different agents (giving them the same information). I was effectively ""charged""  valuable time out of my work day to undo a transaction Expedia failed to make but had charged my credit card for anyway!This should be illegal.

This was until I had to cancel accommodation in Thailand because the airline cancelled our flight at the last minute. Since Friday 27 February 2015, I have tried to resolve this with Expedia.com.au They have provided me with many different reference numbers and when I called they keep me on hold for ages before telling me to ring back later when the hotel is open for business.When I call them back, I speak to a different person and have to start from the beginning. Operators come out with excuses such as they cannot open or have not received my email with flight cancellation details. They have also advised me that the Hotel is awaiting confirmation from me as to the reason why the flight is cancelled.When I called the Hotel, and sent the confirmation of airline cancellation, they advised me that they were awaiting instructions from Expedia to authorise the cancellation and the refund. They also told me that they have had no contact from Expedia about my enquiry- clearly someone is not telling the truth.After reading the other messages here on this review site, there is an all too familiar pattern.The staff in the call centre in India who are so patronising in their apologies and repeatedly saying that they understand my concerns and they are sincerely sorry.I have come to the conclusion that this is not a bad customer care issue but something far more sinister.They have my money and they will not be giving it back without a major fight.I would urge everyone to avoid them and do what you can to pursue your losses through the CTTT and credit card company and also to share your experiences with this company.

We paid 50 euro per day for a 4 stars hotel but the reality was completely different. This hotel would hardly be a 3 stars, 25 euro max.

So, we had to pay for the fees for the luggage.  Expedia refused to admit any wrongdoing by not disclosing how they bill the credit cards,  and was not willing to talk to our airline about it or reimburse us for our  baggage fees.

1515	            My husband and I decided to book our honeymoon through Expedia thinking it would be a much easier and stress free process since we could book the Disney park tickets, plane flight, and hotel all in one place.  First problem that occurred started with our hotel. Expedia advertised our hotel as Downtown Disney. After trying to link our trip to mydisneyexperience.com we realized that our hotel was 5 miles outside of downtown Disney. We called and cancelled the hotel and received our full refund for the hotel. Remind you this took about 2 hours to find a different hotel in Downtown Disney plus extra money. Second problem occured with our park hopper tickets. When I tried to link our tickets to the mydisneyexperience I had no luck. I then found out that my tickets were vouchers, which means you have to take your vouchers to an admissions place at one of the theme parks in exchange for tickets. Having vouchers also means you cannot book fast pass + until the day you get to the park. Also, the ticket lines are very long. We bought the tickets in advance to be more organized and to be able to book things in advance. I called Disney World and they were able to link one of our vouchers but  then I found out that Expedia only sent over 1 voucher instead of 2 even though we paid for 2. Disney told me that in order to get the other voucher I had to call Expeida and deal with there terrible service. After 2 and a half hours on the phone with Expedia they told me they would call me back after 4 to 7 hours to confirm that the other voucher was sent to Disney's computer system. I am still waiting to hear back from them.I really am disappointed because I wanted to have a relaxing and stress free honeymoon. I can't believe that Disney would even be involved with a company like this. I hope that this review helps keep others from booking through Expedia and having to experience the same problems that my husband and I had to deal with. Expedia is a company full of false advertisement and terrible customer service. I can't believe the are still in business.        	                2	1	Saturday	expedia	neutral

Despite it saying that I could try and change the flight without logging in, but able to use itinerary number, I could not as it said it related to an account...an account that is so old that I have no memory of either the login email or password. So the old fashioned way - call.  Easier said than done. Finally found a phone number but was directed to enter my phone number used in the booking, which did not have one so irrelevant. Finally the computer surrendered and allowed me to enter the itinerary number. Then on to an over 12 minute wait calling internationally.  Their website keeps sending me marketing emails despite me not signing up for these - of course cannot stop them as would have to go into the above mentioned account. Like NSA Hitlers of the travel booking world - intrusive - waste of time. I now know why I lapsed my account for so many years.

1520	"            I made a reservation over the phone for a two night stay.  I advised the representative that I was traveling with my 3 year old granddaughter and 3 small dogs.  I was put on hold and when he came back he said he'd called the hotel directly and verified they were pet friendly and I'd be bringing 3 small dogs.  We completed the reservation process and I hung up feeling confident about our plans.  After being on the road for 11 hours we get to our hotel...they had our reservation but nothing on it about having pets.  The hotel had 4 ""pet"" rooms and they were all occupied.

1521	            I booked a return ticket 4 months ago for coming March: Phnom Penh - Zurich with layover time in Bangkok of 1.5 hours. Meanwhile I made a flight from Phnom Penh to Phuket and realised that 1.5 hours is not enough time to change flights in Bangkok, as Bangkok air on all 4 flights was constantly late (up to 1 hour). In the end my suitcase did not arrive with me and I had a sleepless night until it was finally delivered. This uggly experience alarmed me and I wanted to call Expedia to ask, if they guarantee the connection to the Swiss flight and if not, what I should do. But I did not get through to the agent: There phone application asks for a 10 digit phone number - mine in Cambodia is 11, some are 12. I have no possibility to indikate the booking number like they state in the bill. I tried to call 5 times in vain. Then I wrote an email which was not answered. Another email to the custumor service with the automatic reply of getting an answer within 24 hours. Now it's four days... I got in touch with Bangkok air and Swiss. Both state that I must contact Expedia. This was my first and my last booking with Expedia if they have no customer service at all....        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1522	            Beware of Art Deco Suites in Cancun and EXPEDIA who represents them.My email request to Art Deco for clarification on published pricing inconsistencies [on Trip Advisor site] went unanswered.I saw this same listing on Expedia and called an agent to clarify my questions. Satisfied with agents answers, inaccurate, I booked via Expedia agent on the phone. [He assured me the taxes of 19% were included]Later, on checking my invoice I noticed several errors....overcharges. First was for a second person supplement...I'm a solo traveler, secondly was the inclusion of a hotel19% tax.The second agent agreed with the errors, and agreed to my request to reissue an amended invoice.This did not arrive.When I called back I was told to deal with the hotel when I arrived....if they wouldn't correct the amount in error the call Expedia.Not a satisfactory option.Three phone calls ensued, total time  well over three hours. I was told Arts Deco wasn't answering the phone and a supervisor would follow up the next morning.I found Art Deco's website and sent an emil asking for Airport transportation options....still unanswered.Next AM, called to find the Expedia supervisor had NOT been notified, so we started again. Another hour on the phone, he was still unable to reach Art Deco. Following day, new supervisor who knew nothing, still unable to reach Art Deco. Phone message stated this was no longer a valid phone number. I requested a full refund and was told Expedia was unable to do so, and Art Deco would charge for the FULL 28 day reservation regardless of whether reservation was cancelled or not.I was told the last step was to escalate this issue to management [Expedia] and I would receive a call back within 24 hrs. So, less than ten days prior to my departure, I cancel my Credit card as the last and only option to protect myself from this shady situation.BOO to both ART DECO SUITES and EXPEDIA.I now have airline tickets, no hotel nor credit card to book one with!Update.More than 72 hours later, two more calls to Expedia initiated by me....still unable to reach a department who is authorized to discuss issues with me.My complaint now is that I was emailed this morning by Art Deco stating they couldn't accept a credit card, they have no terminal. They are requesting payment for the incorrect amount through PayPal.All online sites warn never respond to private requests for payment.Why is Expedia still carrying this listing after repeated customer service issues?        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

I wont be using them again.. the site said save 200.00 by booking flight and hotel together.. no.. they cost me $150 more by booking together with them.. and the warning that only came up on the itinerary that tells me the rooms are not soundproof and may be noisy has me thinking this may not be the well earned rest i had hoped for. .

Kept getting cut-off and no one called back despite promising to. 20 minute wait each time I called over two three day period. Eventually said they had changed flights then emailed that they had ""forgotten"" to tell me about an extra charge, so I had to call ye again to resolve. Couldn't even properly change hotel booking so it still shows wrong on my itinerary. Poor English of some staff although supervisors are okay. Only offer premium line to call which costs 40p per min from landline and more form mobile so I incurred massive bill to solve problem! Eventually agreed partial compensation for phone call cost, but only as Expedia credit and no compensation for wasted time and poor service.

Everything was all set for a great weekend, but wait the incompetent agent from Expedia booked us for the wrong weekend which we didn't figure out until 36 hrs before sailing.  Expedia challenged me from the start when I let them know about the mistake that was made.  They said it was my fault and that they needed 24 hrs to review the phone call.  They did get back with me, but only said that the phone call didn't give them ""sufficient evidence"" that they made a mistake.  What's even more BS is that they said that I needed a court ordered subpoena to get a copy of the tape.

1532	"            I recently bought a ticket on Etihad Airways to travel round trip from Paris, France to Mumbai, India through Expedia. I also bought travel insurance through Expedia. When my travel within India aboard Indian Air arrived two hours late to Mumbai, causing me to miss my connection with Etihad, the Airlines declared me a ""no show"" and refused to allow me to go out on the next flight to Paris unless I bought a new ticket for nearly a $1,000. They knew my reason for arriving late was due to a late arriving flight, but still tried to get me to buy another ticket. I obviously would not go along with their tactics, so I purchased a somewhat cheaper ticket on Qatar Airlines. When I tried to reach Expedia for help, they never answered.  When I got home I told them what happened and they said since Etihad declared me to be a ""no show"" my travel insurance with them was now void. Then the customer service rep connected me to a horrible automated system, which was his way of hanging up. I have had minor problems with Expedia in the past whereby I declared never to use them again, but this was by far my worst (and most expensive) experience, so I would be financially foolish to continue using them in the future.

In fact, the person I spoke with was supposed to call me within 48 hours after checking with the hotel. They never called. When I called again, more than a week later, they had no trace of my previous call and could not do anything for me. I asked to close my Expedia account, vowing to never use them again.

1537	            Worst Airlines ever flew with. I was flying to Denver(USA) from Regina (Canada). When I reached airport flight was showing delayed. I checked in at united counter and they said plane will be here shortly. After getting security done all the passengers were waiting and about an hour after our flight delayed time they said flight has been cancelled. The person at the boarding counter said go to united counter for further inquiries and of course there was no one at the united counter. So anyways I called united at their toll free number. The lady I talked to said that she cannot get me on any flight till next week. Then she said I can book you from Toronto to Denver and take a cab Regina to Toronto. Of course she never looked how far is Toronto from Regina, it is 27 hours drive. And from Regina to my destination (Denver) it was 14 hours drive. So I told her that it is not possible. Then after being on phone with her for 45 minutes she found another flight from Saskatoon(which is 2 hours drive from Regina) for next day. I considered this option but I asked her how will my Taxi charges will be paid for my transportation to Saskatoon and she guaranteed me that united will compensate all those charges. I have to pay them now and the reclaim it from united. I asked her to put some notes on my request.After taking her word that united will compensate all of my expenses of cab, I took cab to Saskatoon and costs me $480. Now when I filed a claim on Cab charges the representative from united responded after two weeks and said that there is no record of my calls and they cannot pay any cab charges. After emailing her few times back and forth she said she can send me a certificate $150 which was not acceptable to me at all. Now I am emailing her back again that this is not acceptable to me at all because if United wouldn't have promised me to pay my cab charges, I would have cancelled my flight and took the money back and booked my flight from some other airlines. But now she is not even responding back to my emails. I am waiting for her reply from last two weeks and there is no response. I really don't know where to go now.

She finally consulted with someone else and realised it was not booked. Now not trusting her we asked for someone else to help us book and were told they were not allowed (by management) to transfer calls. We pressed them and miraculously were transferred! The man we next spoke to asked us all of the same questions as the unhelpful woman did not tell him anything we had told her. One we started over with him he was in the midst of booking it for us then we had a long pause and heard ""thank you for calling Expedia, how can I help you?"" Astonished! New person who had no idea what we wanted, would not transfer us back and wanted to start form the beginning with us. We were on the phone for 40 minutes and still no holiday booked.

1543	            We booked a vacation package and called in (within 24 hrs) to change to an earlier flight (same airline, same day).The rep told us she was going to charge us $150 to make this change and said that this was the fee charged by the airline.And I had to tell her that I looked up the airline's policy and it clearly states that there is no charge if we make changes within 24 hours. Next, this rep said ok, and goes on to say then we will charge you $86 for the change because the airline ticket cost has gone up. I pointed out the fact that, if I go onto Expedia's website to book this revised vacation package (with the earlier return flight), the package cost is EXACTLY the same as my previous package, so why is Expedia charging me the extra $90?? Then she said she doesn't see it on her screen and asked me which website I see it on - how many are there???And the rep goes on to say she can cancel my whole vacation package and I can re-book on my own, which I thought was good. But then she goes on to say that there is no refund on the hotel though.So basically in the end, we have no choice but to pay for the extra charges.After this horrible time wasting experience, will NEVER EVER book through Expedia again.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
1544	            I booked a two round trip tickets for my parents in November 2014. I received my confirmations and everything looked ok. In December, I was going to pay the credit card where I had made the charges and I noticed that I was charged and extra set of tickets also for my parents, with the same itinerary and for the same amount, on a different airline. I called Expedia and they told me that I made the purchase and that it was non refundable so they could do nothing about it. I told them to send me proof that I purchased the tickets because I only received the confirmations for the tickets I actually purchased, and they would not say anything. After requesting to escalate the issue, talking to three people, including a supervisor that was rude and waiting almost three hours on the phone while she was trying to talk to the airline, she told me that the airline would not refund it. Meanwhile, my husband talked to the airline and they told him that all Expedia had to do, was calling the airline and request a refund because it was through them that the purchase was made. A refund that it would cost me penalties (over $200.00 per ticket) and the refund was not going to go on my name but my parents name. A day later, I called again Expedia and explained what the airline had said to my husband. The lady who answered the phone this time, told me to wait again on the phone while she talked to the airline. Waited another hour and fifteen minutes and she came back saying that the airline told her that I needed to request the refund through the airline's website. I told her that I didn't understand it, if the charged was made by Expedia and not the airline. Well, since that did not sound right to me and also because requesting the refund online would not give me the opportunity to explain the situation, I called the airline to confirm what Expedia told me to do and the lady at the airline told me that Expedia needed to call. Finally, I explained the whole story to this lady and ask for advise. I did not know what else to do and Expedia does not offer on its website another way to deal with these issues. I believe she felt too bad about it, plus she could see in the record all the calls we made on this, (but couldn't see any records of Expedia calling!). She talked to a supervisor (my husband and I are frequent flyers with them) and agreed to give me the refund without penalties, to avoid more back and forth with Expedia. It looked to me that the airline went through this before with Expedia. I would never use Expedia again!! Customer Service from the one who answered the phone to the supervisors... By the way, in December 2014. I rented a car during my vacations and there was a couple that made car reservations through Expedia and were so upset because they had paid extra to have insurance coverage that aren't honored in that country. Expedia never told them that, but they charged the fee, that by the way according to them, it wasn't refundable. STAY AWAY FROM EXPEDIA!!!        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

1546	            Expedia really deserves negative stars - to save you reading the review my conclusion is never ever use Expedia.Customer Service is the worst I have ever dealt with.  Barely speak English, barely understand English, and barely understand the nuances of travel.  I understand 5-10 minutes wait time on the phone for a rep' to answer.  But to spend a further 60 minutes on the phone with the rep as you try to have them change a flight on an existing itinerary.  In regard its Terms &amp; Conditions it says no charge for bookings cancelled within 24 hours.  Not true, and I know another reviewer is having similar problems to mine.I book a flight, and then my schedule is changed within 2 hours.  I call to change the flights and am informed it is better to cancel as it was booked within 24 hours.  Nothing will appear on the credit card and just go ahead and make a new booking for your flight.  I now have 2 charges on my card.  Now I'm forced to deal with the INEPT customer service group again.  They inform me that the 1st charge is not a real charge it is just a hold and will drop off; baloney, try telling that to Visa who want the actual statement paid.  I am still within the time period to dispute the charge with Visa, as a fraudulent transaction made by Expedia; I will give Expedia another crack at getting it right on this, my last ever booking with them.Never, ever use Expedia.        	                2	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

1550	"            I tried to pay for tickets for a vacation for feb 18-feb24. On dec 28. It was advertised for total for two people for $3295 for the trip plus $132 per person for insurance with a total of $3559. The completion would not go through there website kept saying ""page error"". Then proceeded to try on there application and also said ""page error"". So we thought there was a problem with the website. Therefore we waited the next day to book it and the price went up to $3774 plus $132 per person for insurance total being $4038. That's a $474 increase so we booked it before it went up any further and went through no problem. We'll we tried to call customer service today and see if they could comp that extra $474 at our hotel or return the money and was told sorry Maybe the website was under construction. And there was nothing they can do about it. We spoke to supervisor Tyler employee ID 1964 and was really rude and accused us of having bad service and credit card declining. That is a pretty rude assumption. And felt discriminated against. Then when asked him about him saying he is sorry the website might have been under construction he denied ever saying that to me. Horrible experience. Will NEVER use this company again. Will leave this feedback on every review site I am able to.

1552	            I can not emphasize this enough. All insurance sold through expedia is a rip-off.  The car rental insurance (from a company other than the rental car company ) will not be recogonized in Mexico (where I traveled) and other countries (from what I've heard). So you will have to pay 2x or 3x the rental cost for the necessary insurance. You will NOT get a car without insurance that the country will recognize. PERIOD! And it feels like extortion when you are at the counter trying to argue that you already bought the insurance. If you want the car you WILL pay!...AGAIN! Best bet: buy insurance with the car from the same company at the time you book your rental.The travel insurance offed through EXPEDIA will still end up costing you money if you have to change plans.Better to book directly with airlines and reputable big name car rental places to know that you are indeed getting what you paid for; and that the company (airline, hotel and/rental car agency) will back its own policies. No one really honors the deal Expedia makes with you. Even my flight got changed around so many times before I flew out that the more costly itenerary I paid for ( 8.5 hours of travel) was actually swapped for a cheaper iternerary (12 + hours of travel time). This was not what I had purchased!I am done, done, done with EXPEDIA. Like any middleman, they only serve to make money off a transaction you could have made directly. Please spare yourself the grief and just book direct. The  money you save by not buying  bogus insurance through expedia will off-set the cost of booking direct.With regard to hotel and car rentals booked directly, you may also be able to cancel your arrangements  with as little as 2 days notice and not have to pay. Just my opinion. Hope this helps        	                3	1	Sunday	expedia	positive
1553	            My daughter was flying in on 12/18/14 for christmas. She had to fly in early on 12/12/14 as her aunt passed away and she needed to attend the funeral. I called Expedia to change the flight and was told I would have to pay $200 to change the flight despite having the travel insurance. I found a flight one way on the 12th for less than $200 so I bought that (on Expedia). I notified Expedia that she would not be using the flight on the 18th. They then cancelled her flight back on the 30th and I was told that it did not make a difference whether we had notified them of the change. I was given a credit and told that I would have to pay $200 for the change. Please do not use expedia. I was left on hold for hours and hours by untrained, rude people who have great difficulty speaking English.

Also, the hotel does not change money and that required us to travel down town to change dollars into Euros. Big surprise not needed as we checked in late. Overall hotel was very nice and service was exceptional, but extra "" taxes"" we're a surprise. A 12 Euro tax on a 30 Euro daily rate seems too high.

We tried to change the date well in advance and expedia blamed that the Sheraton would not make the change.  I called the Sheraton and they said Expedia would not make the change.  Keep in mind that neither company would lose any money.  I was trying to change the date, not cancel.  As far as I am concerned both parties are being unreasonable and I am out $160.00.  The next step is to call Td Visa and try and have them block payment.  I have spent hundreds, if not thousands of dollars via expedia in the past.

I will do everything I can to let the world know to do the same and to book through a travel agent or directly with the airline.

When you are asked about signing up for this $150.00 plan it states within the purchase window ""Cancel for Any Reason"" and receive a refund. It does not include that you will not be refunded the purchase price of the Airfare which in our case would be a $1,308.28. My wife and I rarely travel and booked this 6 months ago and keep in mind that this trip does not even happen for 6 months but to some unseen events in our household we decided to cancel the trip. Yet still they want to keep 1,308.28 as a credit. After my wife and I heard about this horrific plan, my wife cried because this is a lot of money in our house, but they don't care. I will and would never refer anyone to Expedia and wanted to tell consumers to not trust what they say.        "	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
1563	"            We stayed at the Holiday Inn Midtown Austin from 11/23/14 to 11/27/2014. We booked through Expedia and paid $475.08 for the four days. While staying there, there were numerous problems with the hotel room. They include:1)	On 11/26/2014, there was a reception at the hotel. The music was so loud and the bass was so strong that we could hear it on the 8th floor. We called the front desk around 9:30pm to complain, and they stated they would address the problem with the DJ and would ask them to turn the sound down to reasonable level. The sound not only was not turned down, it got louder. And this went on until after midnight. 2)	No one cleaned the room on 11/24 or 11/25. The “do not disturb” sign was taken off the door around noon each day. We let the first day go, but when no one cleaned the second day, we placed a call to the front desk around 3:30pm on 12/25. We were told housekeeping went home for the day.3)	The toilet was slow to flush and the sink was slow to drain, although they fixed the problem on the day we reported it.4)	The sliding metal lock on the sliding glass door was not installed properly. It took us almost three days to get it to lock, and we only got it to lock by using all our weight to pull on the door and then pushing the sliding lock in. I cannot imagine that this lock on the sliding glass door is acceptable to Holiday Inn audit standards. 5)	The TV programming and sound was completely messed up. For example, if we watched Anthony Bourdain “Parts Unknown,” the sound was for a completely different program on another channel. This occurred the entire time we were there. We did not report this to the front desk until the last day we were there because we assumed it was a problem throughout the hotel (e.g. cable related).When we checked out on 11/27/2014, we gave a list of all the problems to Porshia, the front desk clerk. She advised us that she would have been happy to give us a discount if we had not booked through Expedia, but because we directly booked through them, she had no access to adjust our bill. Therefore, we took the problem up with Expedia when we arrived home. On 12/01/2014, we spoke to Lauren at Expedia. She stated they would phone the hotel  on 12/02 at 10pm when Porshia arrived for her normal work day, and they would contact us about the discount. On 12/02, we received an e-mail from Expedia stating that the Holiday Inn was refusing to give us a discount despite the numerous problems we had and despite what we had been told upon checkout on 12/27. We called the Holiday Inn and spoke to Porshia. She stated she would have to get a manager involved and that we should have booked directly with them. She stated they never recommend Expedia due to problems like this. To put it bluntly, we were more than dissatisfied with the problems we experienced at the hotel. Finally, Porshia should have never offered a discount, period, if she was not authorized to do so. As a result, we have filed a BBB report, an Attorney General report with the state of Washington where Expedia is based, another one with our own state, as well as complaints against Holiday Inn. If you have experienced similar problems, I would suggest you file your own reports.        "	                2	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

I asked Expedia to discount my reservation for my inconvenience from their mistake.

1566	"            I booked a trip for the whole family and later on wanted to cancel the current trip and to re-book the trip for other date. I called the customer support and asked them about the cancellation charges. I was informed about the cancellation charges. Based on the cancellation information provided I booked my 2nd trip and asked the customer agent to cancel my previous trip. The agent informed me that she cannot cancel this trip, for this she has to contact the support unit to cancel my trip. She informed me that support unit will either call you or send you an e-mail within 24 to 48 hours. So far it's been more than 12 days and I have called the customer support more than 15 times. Sometimes the call hold time was more than 55 minutes and then the call use to drop. I have also sent e-mails several times to the customer support and the only response I got was that it's not us send your e-mail to support unit. Funny thing there is no e-mail address provided for the customer support. I also talked with the Customer Agent Supervisors and they had the same story. ""Someone will contact you."" At this point I am so fed-up that I just want to cancel both trips and de-activate my Expedia account. My total amount stuck with two trips is almost 4000 US$.

We were charged an extra person fee even though the standard of the industry around the world and at any other Crowne Plaza we have stayed at is 2 people to one room, (except of course for here!!).  The explanation given to us by the Expedia CS rep was that the rate quoted on Expedia was for only 1 person.

1570	            Booked a holiday (flight and hotel) with Expedia last week - my partner subsequently found the same holiday on lastminute.com with a fairly whopping price difference of £200 per person less. Not to worry, we thought, under Expedia's advertised best price guarantee we will be able to get this difference refunded as it is the exactly the same flights and hotel. Contacted them within the requisite 48 hours, only to be told that because the cancellation policy for lastminute.com is not exactly the same as that of Expedia, the holiday could not be deemed to be identical and therefore no refund would be made. Gah! Horrible, grotty Expedia, they will inevitably trawl through the fine print of every other provider and find some difference, however small, to wriggle out of making any refunds! They shouldn't advertise this best price guarantee because in reality it doesn't genuinely exist.

I'm using Expedia since 2010, but on 20-Nov-2014 is the first time I require some changes in my booked flight itinerary, here the core business appears and the true face of irresponsibility appears. All I want is cancel 1 of 3 passenger's flight, so the agent on the phone instead of cancelling 1 of 3 flight she cancelled the whole itinerary! I stayed on phone over 6 hours! 6 hours of long distance call. No one want to admit &amp; take the responsibility, even some RUDE agents just dropped the call many times. Finally we've agreed that Expedia will cover the cancellation fees of 2 of 3 passengers and will book on the same flight covering rate difference, so I just agreed here the agent asks me for payment, I just told him you should hold the refund process and re-book the flight then make re-fund for rest of amount, but the seem to be robotic, re-fund process takes from 5 to 15 working days and my credit card wasn't ready at that time so he just keep telling me they can't guarantee the flight availability until the refund appears on my credit card. bla bla bla bla. 6 hours of bla bla bla. on last call the RUDE agent just dropped the call after connected me with Delta agent!Anyway, Expedia may offer some good deals, but if you make simple google search you'll find tons of alternatives, plans not always go right, so I recommend to stay away from Expedia, specially if you're leaving outside US, Expedia's customer service is worst than ever worst customer service in poor developing countries in Middle-East or Asia.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative

I had to change a booking and online the site puts a user in a non-stop loop telling them to select options to change a booking that do not exist on the website.  When there is a ""call"" button, the number never loaded so I had to email them explaining the problem.  The email I got back explained that I needed to use the online system, even when I explained that the options that the website says exist, do not appear (I even used the '""find"" function looking for the options.) I then called and was disconnected twice.This is not a good option when an emergency can happen overseas, like finding a hotel that claims they don't have a reservation, etc.  Booking.com and Agoda both have better service, so keep in mind that while Expedia books rooms fine, they do not do any sort of proper support after that.

1578	            Booking through expedia website can be easy and get you a great deal which I did with my international flights My nightmare started when a flight was cancelled and rescheduled, which is fine as that does happen. But trying to obtain any information from the people in the call centre was impossible. It took me 4 phone call each at about 1hour wait to finally hear options the airline was giving us with our cancelled flight. Trying to speak to the call centre was very hard when they avoided answering questions and would just repeat  the last thing they said. I had one guy that I was speaking to for about an hour about other flight options tell me suddenly that he would just request a refund when I never mention anything about wanting a refund and was asking about other flight options. It sounded like it was just to hard for him and he was trying to make it easier for him. After a week I finally got flight options and made the change from our cancelled flight to our new flight. After all that I rang expedia twice (the first time being cut off after 45min) to find out the cost to change my flight to the next day. The first leg was with Air Canada from Vancouver to LA and connecting with Qantas through to Sydney. Expedia said they couldn’t give me any information on the air Canada flight and call back in business hours so I ask to get the cost of the Qantas flight. They were very hesitant to call the airline but eventually did. They then came back and quoted a total charge of $869 to change my flight in 6months time to the next day for only the LA to Sydney flight. I then called Qantas to verify this and they said that firstly that they couldn’t understand why they couldn’t give me any information on air Canada flight as Qantas could provide the cost to change and all airline do have a 24hr call centre. Qantas then said to change both flights would be a total of $280.  They also said that they find as expedia has such a high turnover of staff that they often struggle when it comes to changes and often make mistakes. Never again would I use expedia as they may provide great deals to start with but can turn into a nightmare when it comes to changes.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	neutral

It took NINE hours on the phone with cusomer service to try and resolve the issue. First they wanted to cancel and then they refused to cancel. Despite giving the representative my phone number at the start of the conversation in case we were cut off, I was never called back when this happened three times. Each time I was disconnected I had been on hold for hours. Once they finally agreed to cancel the ticket I was told it would take 3 months for the airlines to process the refund. Three months later - no refund. When I called to follow up I was blithely told they hadn't forwarded the information to the airline and they would do so now, but it would take 8 weeks for the refund to process.

You can cancel of course, but no refunds allowed, sorry        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	neutral

Calling from Scotland.We booked a hotel in Portgal  through Expedia. We decided to email the hotel directly to ask a few questions. The Hotel said they had contacted Expedia to make them aware they had no rooms and that they had over booked. The hotel said they had contacted Expedia, but advised we do the same. And that's when it resulted in five calls, a real reluctance to refund, a really arrogant American who was insistent we book another hotel with them, and we told him every time we did not require that. Each time he out us on hold for ten minutes. Each time he offered us thaE same thing. We said "" no thank you "" repeatedly, but in the end we just got angry.. We have now been told that it will be ten working dats before we get our money back,. DO NOT use EXPEDIA . Appalling        "	                2	1	Monday	expedia	negative

Hours and hours waiting to change my reservation but I would have to pay almost double what I already paid, even though I paid damn 289 for insurance in case something like this happened. I was not able to change the darn reservation, so I said I want to cancel it, sure sir, but your flights money for 5 people will be credit and you have to use it within a year at the same airlines.. What the F$$$#, OK I said fine, let me add mails to my to my reservation and transportation from the airport... hours of waiting and then disconnected, I called three times after that, and I finally talked to a person who took my number in case we get disconnected, nice move. Well after 45 minute waiting, he comes back and said sir we can add anything to your reservation....What the F$$%% why, I am adding money and services what's wrong with that!!!Well sir to be able to do so, we have to cancel all your reservation and start allover again. I said OK fine, please do. Another 25 minutes he comes back and said sorry sir, we can't find any reservation to a hotel or airplane....in away you are F%^$&amp;^$ sir, so take it like a man .....@@## Man I am so pissed, I will never recommend them and will never use their services ever again....        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	positive

Whenever I ring I am put on hold or told the system is down and to ring back later. 1 month ago I was told the refund would be processed in 15 working days. No refund. Many apologies but no action. Last week I was told that Emirates had refunded the, but they didn't know when. I keep ringing and they keep making excuses. Dreadful company.

1595	            I booked a flight from Sydney to London return with Expedia and thought I had got a fantastic deal. The itinerary had the leaving time from London at 12pm so I thought i should double check the time as this could easily mean midday or midnight.After being disconnected 2 times i called Vietnam Airlines directly. They then notified me that I would need a transit visa as I had an internal flight (a fact that expedia had not bothered to share with me) between the 2 international flights and that expedia would organise it.I called expedia back and after being disconnected a further 4 times finally spoke to 'supervisor' who said it was my responsibility to organise all visas.After loosing my temper I called Vietnam Airlines back and the lovely lady there told me they had informed Expedia that with this fare special a free transit visa was to be organised by Expedia, that she had had a lot of trouble with the company.So now I am sitting trying to ready myself to call back and start the process of talking to their 'company representatives' again.I feel bad for any person who will be stranded because Expedia did not follow the instructions of Vietnam Airlines. I will NEVER book with Expedia again and urge anyone else to Stay Far Away from this shambles of a company.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive

About a third of the way into the conversation I realized I was, in fact, speaking with someone from Expedia.  My instinct was to have just hung up...but I didn't.  I should have listened to my instincts.  Expedia charged me $149.00 a night for my room.  The hotel told me my rate would have been $89.00 for Friday night and $129.00 for Saturday night.  When I called the number on my email confirmation to complain about the price gouging, I was told that they couldn't help me resolve my problem because they couldn't verify my phone number or my email address with their records!! They sent me a confirmation email, but when I read that email address back to them it didn't match their records?!?!?!?  What a crock!!  I had never used Expedia before and I will definitely NEVER use them again!!!  And I will also tell everyone who will listen never to use them either!!!!!!!

1597	            As an infrequent but long time user of Expedia, I have always had a pleasant experience with their services.  However, my most recent trip to Cancun, Mexico is a shining example of how one simply cannot trust this company.Expedia has a very convenient and (usually) accurate option to search for deals on all-inclusive vacation packages.  Using this option my spouse and I recently booked a 10 night stay at the Marriott CasaMagna in Cancun.  The price for the whole package was very reasonable due to, I suspect, the fact that this was the off-season for travel to Cancun.The flight was reasonable and upon arrival to the hotel, we learned – to our surprise – that there is no “All-Inclusive” option at this particular establishment.  We immediately called Expedia and after three hours of being put on hold, bounced around, dropped we finally talked to a Customer Service Representative.  After explaining the situation to the CSR and his supervisor, it was agreed that Expedia had made a mistake and would reimburse us for any food or beverages we ordered from the hotel during our stay (we were to treat this stay as an all-inclusive).As neither of us are big drinkers nor big eaters, we averaged about 2 meals and 2 drinks per day each.At the end of the trip we had incurred $921 (CAD) in additional charges for food and beverages.  Considering that the stay was for 10 days and there were 2 of us, that works out to $46/day each for food and drinks.  I think this is a very reasonable amount…When we returned home after the trip, we emailed Expedia a copy of the receipt showing the breakdown of the $921 in extra expenses incurred because of the “All-Inclusive” mistake.   Then after spending over seven hours on the phone with them over the next two weeks they only agreed to reimburse us for $300 of it.  Without giving us any reasons, they threatened that it was to be $300 or nothing.In then end I’m glad that they only “stole” $621.  Reading some other peoples’ reviews of Expedia’s services have shown me that it could have been a far, far worse experience costing me far more money.  Needless to say I will never book another flight/hotel/vacation with Expedia ever again.  I sincerely hope that people react to this kind of business practise and join me in boycotting Expedia.TLDNR: Do not use Expedia as you will have to pay for any mistake that they make – they will not do the reasonable thing of reimbursing you.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative
1598	            Expedia changed our flights with no notification to us. American Airlines charges you extra fees which they make you unaware of until after the fact. The Airline will also change your seats and not make you aware of it. After you end up paying more fees to the airline in addition to a heap load of stress you end up paying far more than you would if you just went directly to the airline/hotel etc. Expedia is a shady and corrupt organization and we will NEVER do business with them again.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

1600	"            I was looking for a hotel in Buffalo NY for Saturday night Oct. 18 for my son and I on line.  I usually use Holiday Inn and they were all booked up obviously because of a game .  I clicked on a hotel that was with the IHG group that had a room unfortunately when I called the number the person, who did not identify themselves as an Expedia rep informed me there was only a King size bed. I required two beds. She then informed me the Buffalo Marriott had what I required. I asked several questions regarding the amenities and the reviews. The reviews met my requirements and I allowed her to make reservations. I asked if I would be penalized if I cancelled my reservations, and they indicated no.  At no time did this representative inform me my credit/debit card would be debited immediately. I had just hung up the phone, my confirmation had not even been emailed and my cell phone pinged to notify me that my bank had debited the $203 for the room. I immediately called back the number I called and questioned this... I was told if I cancel my reservation I will get my full refund but it will take two weeks. I asked to speak to a supervisor. After waiting approx. 5 minutes a man named Frank got on the phone.  He was rude, disrespectful etc.  I asked to speak to his supervisor and was informed he had none.  I told him I was a 62 year old woman and did not deserve his disrespect and requested to have the corporate number to which he replied there was no corporate and hung up on me. I called back and reached a female supervisor who did in fact connect me to corporate.  However Jeff in corporate was equally rude.  He informed me my refund would take a few days however. He said that Expedia ASSUMES it's customers understands they will be charged immediately. He stated they are not OBLIGATED TO INFORM.  this is amazing. I am sure many people are pleased with this company. However I am not. As I informed Jeff I will NEVER USE THEM AGAIN AND WILL ALWAYS ASK when making hotel reservations "" are you Expedia""?  I will stick my reputable and reliable IHG., and pray they have rooms available even if I have to drive an extra hour.   Expedia does not have any idea how to give customer service and obviously how to train their employees.....        "	                4	1	Wednesday	expedia	positive
1601	            I am extremely disappointed in my experience with Expedia and its customer service. After calling no less than 5 times and being hung up on/disconnected each time after relaying my issue, it seems that the hang up treatment is an intentional ploy to not deal with the issue. Finally, after waiting on hold for upwords of an hour on my 6th attempt, I was able to finally speak to a supervisor. The supervisor was rude, her accent was so heavy it was difficult to understand, and she was unwilling to make a minor issue right.Here is the issue:I booked a trip from San Diego to Cabo from December 29 - January 2. Flight was on Spirit Airlines and the hotel was the Hyatt Ziva.The recent hurricane in Cabo affected the hotel. The Hyatt Ziva is closed until April. So I needed a new hotel.I called Expedia and explained the situation and booked the Pueblo Bonito Sunset Beach. No change to the flight on Spirit Airlines.I was told that the refund on my initial purchase left the flight at $1776.60. My new hotel was $3484.24 for a total trip cost of $5,260.84. All seemed ok, until I looked at the expedia site and, on the same date I booked, the exact same flight and hotel is priced at $4908.00.Either I wasn't refunded enough from the first booking or I was overcharged for the second booking. Regardless, I am due a credit of $352.84. I am still doing a package, why would I pay more for the exact same hotel and flight than what is listed on the Expedia site? I simply have substituted hotels in my package due to the unforseen event of the hotel closure due to the hurricane. Nonetheless, Expedia is refusing to credit back the $352.84. They can't give a rational explanation for why I should be charged more than it costs on the website, but Wendy the supervisor is refusing to budge.I will never use Expedia again and I would not recommend anyone else use the site either.

1602	            We purchased a travel deal from Expedia 1 month before our trip. The airline that they used in the deal was Spirit Airlines. (The most horrible airline on the PLANET! !!!) The airline would not let us check in and they do not have a customer service number. The two idiot women that they have working at the gate were NOT trying to help us AT ALL.  When we called Expedia to find out what we could do about this issue they simply transferred us to Spirit Airlines and Spirit Airlines hung the damn phone up while I was waiting on hold. To say I'm furious is an understatement! !! Not only do I blame Spirit Airlines but I also blame Expedia for referring me to them via our vacation package. Expedia should make sure that the companies they do business with are good companies and treat people with respect. I will NEVER do business with Expedia and certainly I will NEVER do business with Spirit Airlines EVER AGAIN. Bottom line. ..

And even if it is slightly more expensive, I would NOT pay the difference...Result was, I paid the difference and while they apologised saying that they will refund the money, they never did... I have sent them few emails since then to get the difference back and they keep avoiding it.......!This place has to close down!!!!        	                2	1	Thursday	expedia	neutral

The only thing Expedia cares about is you cancellation fee. (1) All most every call will be transferred to India. You speak with the person that really have no idea about the airlines and airports in US. You need to explain to them your travel plan first. (2) Each call will at least cost you 1 hour+, which has been constantly reported by other customers here also. (3) I have really a very hard time to cancel/change the ticket. Do not believe that they are an agent that try to help customers find the cheapest ticket. They want your money and will sell you the most expensive ticket.

1621	            I was also conned into using Expedia.  They have a nice website and a nice app so they give you the trusted impression they are a legitimate company.If anything out of the ordinary happens to your booking, good luck.  I tried to change my reservation and it took several days to get on the phone with them.I was intrigued that they have a 24-hour cancellation policy for reservations which they advertise will have no penalty.  Don't be fooled - this is actually too good to be true.  The reality is that you have to change/cancel your reservation over the phone only and you probably can't get on the phone w/ them in those 24 hours.  I tried.They don't publish their phone number.  When you click on your itinerary to cancel/change it, there is a form you have to fill out and supposedly they will call you.  Unfortunately, I filled this form out over and over to no avail.  Ironically, there is a nice little link next to it explaining why they don't provide their number to their customers, detailing that they can provide even better customer service by calling you directly than you waiting on hold.  I would agree if it worked.  It doesn't - they don't call - and then you get hit w/ a $200 change fee once you finally do get them on the phone nearly a week later.If you're wondering, they never called me.  I went searching and found a phone number somewhere on the internet that worked.  Had I done that in the beginning, I could have saved $200 and they could have avoided this review.  By the way, that phone number is:404-728-8787Call them directly for changes/cancellations or just call to tell them to put a stick in it.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	positive
1622	"            this is one of the worst experiences I have had!I am a ""silver"" member with expedia. I purchase a lot of flights through them yearly. Well... not after this experience anymore...I spend more than an hour waiting to speak to a representative to make a change to my flight.This is after calling them multiple times and being told the queue is 1.5 hours long and that I should leave my number for call back, which they never do... Eventually I get someone from the Philippines on the line (I am in the USA). After a frustrating discussion on explaining and re-explaining that I need to change my flight, they then tell me that my change will cost double what I can see on the expedia site. When I start addressing this with the person (supervisor), the person hangs up the phone call... Get this, I call again, again wait patiently, then ask if I can speak with the same supervisor. Well... they hang up on me again. This is not what I call customer service.        "	                3	1	Monday	expedia	negative
1623	            For a single query for my ticketing reservation, I was transferred from one department to another department 4 times. It was extremely frustrating - I kept having to wait after each transfer to be told that they are not the right person to clarify my query after I repeat my story again and again. I was asking about a ticketing reservation, but I do not know why I was even put to the hotel reservation line 2 times. I expressed my frustration for being transferred for the 4th time at the last guy and he just curtly said that he would not be the right person to answer my query in any case. He might be right but still... Speechless.I ended up giving up during the transfer call wait because I was so so so irritated at that point. I am usually patient with people in the frontline service as I had worked as one before. But Expedia's customer's support is really disappointing.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative

You get answers to questions you did not ask. The call centre never resolves any problems. I have stopped using this ultra large business account with more than 95000 dollars spend this year alone. No more and NEVER again. When I told expedia sales that i would stop using this account they said ""up to you""Great service..... yes right!        "	                2	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
1625	            We booked a king size bed at the Days Inn in Helen through Expedia. When we arrived, the manager said I had no reservation. He was very rude and stated that he would've got a fax. We asked him to check the fax.  It was out of paper, but he claimed it had a paper jam.  My reservation printed along with many others. He was very unapologetic and said all he had was a double. We asked if he could check with another hotel or at least give us a discount, as a double would be very difficult for my fiancé and I to sleep on. He said it wasn't his problem, we are lucky he had a room at all, and we could just leave if we didn't like it.   Expedia was no help at all. They suggested a room with a double bed in a town over twenty miles away at a Super8 motel.  We found a hotel on our own with a king size bed at a nicer place at half the price. I will never use Expedia again nor will I ever stay at the Days Inn.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	neutral

Had to argue with the person on the phone for Expedia for over 30 min just to be told we can only cancel hotel and ground transportation. Then I asked about the $240 Insurance and she said there was nothing they could do. NEVER AGAIN will I ever use EXPEDIA OR US AIR they are the worst I have ever worked with.

1627	            Regrettably, after more than 20 years of great travel experiences with this company, I have vowed to never, ever use them again.  There is no accountability.  No direct phone numbers to talk to someone outside of the call center, which is in the Phillipenes.  You never get the same person twice.  If you want someone in the USA, you have to wait on hold for at least an hour, before that person tells you that there is nothing they can do to help you.  Thid is followed by false promises and broken commitments.  Oh, and plenty of disconnected calls along the way of my 25 hour phone 'journey,' which ironically, is much longer than my international flight.  This service is abominable beyond description and worthy of a lawsuit.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	neutral
1628	            I was told Expedia had notes that they called AND emailed me about the issue with my room, yet I had no contact at all (records of calls or any received emails) until I showed up at the hotel (extra close to our venue) only a short time before my event. I was then told they could move me to another hotel (by the hotel while waiting to get any answers from my Expedia agent) but that I would need to pay more money (by Expedia agent). I was moved farther and farther from my original hotel until I spoke up after being completely annoyed that the customer service agent, while nice, had no clue what to do or where hotels in the area were located. Nothing was offered for our HUGE inconvenience until I made it an issue. I was truly disappointed in this experience with Expedia which really surprised me and the only thing that made it better was the concert that was completely unrelated to this reservation. I'm seriously considering never using this app again. Horribly disappointed.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative
1629	            I had a bad experience with expedia after missing a flight at Dulles Airport. I got to the airlines counter and the airlines personnel told me they could not do anything with the ticket and that only expedia could help me rebook. I called expedia and the operator told me only the airlines could change the flight after check-in had started. I ended that call and a hour or so after arguing with the airlines staff I found out the first expedia operator was wrong when I spoke to a second one. Over the course of 2 hours I spoke to two different operators until one finally told me the best deal I could get in changing my ticket was going to cost me more than $2,000. From my perspective there are two problems. First, there is too much confusion over how to address a ticket booked through expedia that needs to changed both on the part of expedia's own employees and those of the airlines. Second, I suspect the change fees might not be so great if the booking was direct through the airlines. United has changed my flights before at no cost. Regardless, my view is the risk is too great to continue to rely on expedia to book my flights. It appears in my view they are passing their risk and operating cost on to the customer.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	neutral

1632	            My boyfriend booked us a trip to Mexico for my birthday. Well unfortunately it was a complete nightmare through expedia!  About a month before our trip he  noticed the price had gone down so he asked if we could get a price adjustment, amazingly they said yes and said we would receive our refund in about a week. A month went by with us calling every week for our refund but every time they claimed another week or month or so. The day before our vacation we just decided to call the hotel. They claimed to have little communication till just before we called with expedia, and they put through the refund for us. Although we still have not received it. But that's just part of it, when we got to the hotel to check in they told us that expedia only sent them a reservation for one person... So we had to fork out another $300!!  After we spent hours on the phone with expedia represents who basically blamed all of the issues on us and tried to make us feel stupid and accuse us of lying. This was more than stressful and we will never do business with this horrible company again! They do not understand customer service!!!        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

They can't issue my ticket. Talked to three different people and no one can help you. The higher up the person the worst ruder they are. They kept saying your ticket price has gone up. We can't issue your ticket unless you paid the difference. Even clearly stated on your email confirmation your reservation is booked and confirmed. It was the worst experience i have with online booking site. What they said on the website is complete lied. Don't even bother to book through them.

1635	            I mispelled my name accidentally when buying a ticket from Netherlands to Istambul. The flight used two carriers KLM and ALITALIA both of them told me they could make the correction free of charge if I would have bought the tickets with them, but since i used expedia to buy the ticket i had to do it through them. When i contacted them they said there was no solution, i had to rebook with my correct name... meaning i had to buy another ticket. The trip was planned with my wife and we had already booked hotels, so we didnt want to lose that money. We tried calling for three days straight, the first person that took our call was kind and said there was no problem, she said she would fix it took our phone number but never called. We tried calling several times later they picked up and once we stated our situation the calls dropped, this happened like 5 times (international calls by the way). Then when the call didnt drop, they said they couldnt fix the problem and pressured us into buying another ticket, instead of fixing a spelling mistake.

At the other airport they told me I had to go to a train station 20 min away from the airport and when I arrived there they didn't even recognized the itinerary number.... So not only did they sell me a trainticket as a flight, they also never gave me any boarding pass or code for the train. I have evidence of all emails... on my mail it was written as a flight, no where did it say it was a train. Yet when I called several times, they put me on hold for hours, i had many dropped calls, i was told different contrary stories and I had to put up with rude unprofessional impolite and terrible supervisors who refused my refund . When I send them my email... they even changed that on their reply... terrible and dishonest. I will never ever book with them again and i will spread this word to all my friends and the entire world because they are treating people terrible and robbing them of their money... the site needs to be closed. I am trying to sue them now... does anyone have any experience with that?

1638	            I'd give them zero stars, but alas, 1 star is the least number if stars I am able to give. My husband and I booked one of our hotel nights during our honeymoon through Expedia. In reality, they should have not allowed us to book that hotel because after 11 PM, their counter is closed. Unfortunately, we had no idea, and instead paid for a nonexistant room that we couldn't check into. We had to stay somewhere else that evening and when I called Expedia the next day, they promised a refund. After being on the phone for 3 HOURS, they gave me a number that I could use towards booking a hotel in the future (so they never directly refunded the money.) I was fine with that except when I tried to use the number they gave me, it didn't work and when I called them again, they said they don't do credits or refunds. They have the absolute worst customer service I have ever encountered and I'd rather sleep in a crumby hotel than do service with them ever again. I feel lucky that I only lost money for one hotel day rather than flights like some people.

1639	            We are planning our honeymoon and we called because the package on the website would not let us complete the booking.  When we called the help line, that rate was no longer available (suspicisous). We still wanted the hotel/flight package destination so we booked at higher rate ($1,800 difference) because agent said there was only one room left (website shows 3 as of the typing of this email).  When we booked on the phone the conditions of the best price guarantee was not explained so we just put down a deposit. We then found a lower price the very next night ($300 difference), so we completed the online price guarantee application form. However, because we had not paid in full (not explained) we got a notice the next morning that we did not qualify because it wasn't paid.  We immediately called to complete the full payment.  Then when we tried to complete the best price guarantee app it said we were out of the 24 hours window. So dang frustrating. The best price guarantee is a false promise as best as I can tell. The number of rooms left is a lie. And because we weren't able to book the original one online I feel that it is a sham bait and switch. So unhappy about the process and Expedia.  I will never book again on Expedia. Our honeymoon was meant to be a joyous experience and now all we can think of is how we got ripped out of $1,800 then being denied a $300 price difference.  So angry and frustrated.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	positive

1652	            I used expedia to book flight, hotel and rental car for a family vacation. We reached the airport only to find that the car rental agency does not operate out of that airport. We had to take a ferry and a cab to get to the rental agency office. When we got there I was told that I was in the wrong office and had to go to a different location to get the car. So another cab to reach the right rental agency location. What I had asked for was a rental agency with a counter at the airport - it is not a good experience wandering around in the city with luggage searching for the right agency counter to get a rental car. The airport did have counters of other rental car companies - expedia just did not give the appropriate agency in their deal. During the return trip we almost missed the flight as the car had to be returned in the city and we had to take a cab to reach the airport.If I have to do my own research into which airports have which rental agencies why use expedia? I used this site to avoid going through the trouble of having to go through airport, rental car and hotel websites and deciding the best deal. It was a mistake. I let their customer service know about this but no reply yet - I don't think they care since the trip is done and they have got their commission.I will avoid this service in the future and caution anyone using this service to double check the details on your booking.

1653	"            Background: Flew from Nanning to Guangzhou. At Guangzhou airport, we couldn't connect from Vancouver to Seattle, because we don't have Canada Visa. We have never been informed by neither Expedia nor the airlines that Canada Visa is required for the 2 hour layover at Vancouver. The trip was ruined from that point on.We called Expedia right away on the night of Aug 25th to cancel the rest of the itinerary.1st Call, Aug 25th (75min on the phone - most of the time was waiting for agent/supervisor working on the case): Asked for options of alternative flight or cancellation. The agent couldn't handle the cancelation so she connected me to her supervisor. The supervisor calculated the fee and told me he was canceling the itinerary and I would receive an email confirmation in 2 minutes. After an hour waiting. No email confirmation.2nd Call, Aug 25th (lasted another hour): Connected another supervisor (her name is Chelsea): She tried to call China Southern Airline but they were closed at that time, so she open a case (E-7422500) and asked me to call the next day (the 26th). At the same time time, she told me that there's no guarantee of the cancelation (even though I told her the previous supervisor told me he had ""canceled"" the flight and would sent me the confirmation). She also told me there's no record of my previous phone call. This got me really upset. She made it sound like I was lying.3rd Call, Aug 26th (last almost 1 hour): Connected with another supervisor (Brittany). She said she's got someone calling China Southern Airline and would call be back in 1-2 hours or email me. At the end, I was telling her this whole experience with Expedia. She just hung up on me in middle of my talking (very rude). After waiting for the rest of the day, no phone call or email. 4th, 5th and 6th Call, Aug 27th (last 2+ hours min): I don't want to waste time on too much details. They eventually pushed the ball to the airlines. I called the airline and they said all the unused portion should be refundable and the airlines like to work with Expedia to resolve this issue. Expedia just kept refusing to work with the airlines to resolve this issue.In all of those conversations, I was patient, talking slowly and polite, but it doesn't sound like the customer service wanted to listen to my issue. Also, there's no follow-up phone call or email even I was promised so.I have been a long-time and loyal Expedia customer. Over the last couple of years, I booked $20K+ of travel on Expedia.

1654	            I arrived at the hotel I booked with expedia only to find there was no reservation. They were completely full and had no space for me. Provided it was peak season, everything was fully booked. By some freak of nature I found another motel, albeit not as nice, that wasn't totally booked and stayed there for the night. I'd recommend to not use Expedia. Use another booking company or book directly from the hotel if you can.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

The representatives were all friendly, I have to say, but they placed me on 20 or 30 min holds for everything. I do understand that they have other customers to take care of, but it was the same exact ridiculous hold time every single time I called even if it was very early in the morning. They attempted to make the changes to my reservation but for one stupid reason or another they had to contact they airline directly for allowing for the changes, which added more hold time.

1659	"            We traveled 6 hours on a plane after booking our ""all inclusive"" vacation. Got to the hotel to find the hotel claiming expedia did not  book us as all inclusive but charged us for that rate anyway. Fought on the phone with the company for hours because they unexpectedly changed our flights which changed our check in date and made us not eligible for the all inclusive (which NO ONE mentioned when THEY changed our flights to the next day). When we asked to speak to a manager or supervisor at superior at Expedia we were told ""no one is available and would call back"". Needless to say they never did. We ended up having to pay almost double what we were supposed to. Expedia service is terrible and they do not honor anything they advertise!        "	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative
1660	"            Your seat assignments are a ""request"" only that Expedia takes no responsibility for and now tells me they were never more than a request that the airline could ignore or honor at their whim. The seat assignments I selected when I booked flights 6 months in advance through Expedia disappeared when the airline changed the flight times (but not the flight number or itinerary). I'm writing this the day I was notified of the time change after spending one hour and twenty minutes on the phone with Expedia. Now the seats I selected and that appeared to be assigned to me are no longer available and similar seats come with an additional $60 per seat up-charge. The only thing Expedia offered me were seats in the center section of the middle of the plane for the 5 hour flight, and even those are now understood to be only a ""request."" This may not seem like such a big deal, but to me it is. I want others to know they are much better off booking directly with the airline because the airline is more obliged to honor their booking details than booking with Expedia which claims to be only able to accept my money and mask my ""requests"" as the real deal, but with no obligation to try to work with the airline on my behalf. I have been a frequent flyer for the past 25 years, and have almost always booked directly with the airlines. Lesson learned: I will not book through Expedia again.

1667	            My first and only experience with Expedia - I booked bc it was the first time EVER that they were less expensive than dealing directly with the airlines.  I booked a three stop each way trip - one of the airlines cancelled its flight on both the departure and return, throwing all the other segments off.  First agent at Expedia told me it was my responsibility to deal directly with the airline for a refund.  In total, I spoke with five agents for a TOTAL of 3 1/2 hours (mostly on hold) was disconnected three times (I gave them my phone number to call me back if we got disconnected - they did not) and finally with the last person, a supervisor, I was told I could have a refund - I could not be booked on a different flight unless I wanted to pay the difference. Each agent gave me different info and advice and two absolutely did not know what they were doing.  I will NEVER NEVER use Expedia again, if even the fare were cheaper.  It was an aggravating disaster.  I wound up rebooking and had to pay $200.00 more.  (Different itinerary of course)  IT WAS BEYOND HORRIBLE.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
1668	            I booked a round trip on Expedia from an overseas city to Boston with return journey on Aug 15th flying Business Class on British Airways. I wanted to change the travel date to Aug 18th. As is the norm, BA advised me to make the changes through my travel agent, Expedia. I called Expedia for the first time on Aug 12th night around 9 pm EST. The CSR took about an hour 20 minutes but she essentially told me that 1. she could not make any changes without talking to BA customer service in England, which was closed for the day2. BA had considered my ticket as fully consumed right after the first leg of the travel was completed, implying any change would cost me full fare for the new return leg3. someone would contact BA the next morning and revert with information on the requested changeWhen I did not hear back by noon on Aug 13th, I made another call to Expedia. I spoke with a different lady this time and gave her an update on my previous conversation. She reviewed the details and called BA customer service. After a long wait (45 minutes) she confirmed that I could change the ticket for about $835, change fee of $165 included. After a wait of another hour during which the agent periodically checked on me, she finally said that the BA agent was taking very long and to keep me from waiting she took my credit card and cell phone information with a promise to revert after completing the changes. The whole call took about 1 hour 45 minutes. After 3 hours, I called back to check if the change had been finalized. The lady took my information and requested me to wait while she checked on the status for me. After waiting for about 50 minutes, I hung up and called back. This time, I noted the CSR's name, Edward. To understand what was going on, I gave him only my itinerary number and asked him to verify if my request for a change was made. Instead of reviewing the work done by the previous agent, he started the process all over again. I asked him if there were any notes from the previous agents on the itinerary, to which he said that yes there were but he was not sure what was done, hence he would start from the beginning again. He said the following:1. That I would get back about $2400, less cancellation fee of $330, if I cancelled the ticket.2. That there were no seats available on the same class of travel and that I would have to book myself on a higher fare business class for the return leg either on 18th, 19th or 20th (I did not want to check beyond that)3. The change in fare with the change fee would come to an additional $3600 approxThis whole interaction took between 30-40 minutes. I informed the agent that I would stick with my current schedule and not make any changes, but I requested to contact a supervisor to complain about the service I had received. He said that he would leave a note for someone to revert, but I insisted on talking to a supervisor. Finally, he put me on line with a sup named Dante. I informed him about the poor customer service I had received and how I had rescheduled several appointments based on the discussions with an agent that morning. He said that he would check and revert. I insisted that he check the notes and give me the reason the change was not made by the first agent that morning. He informed me that he could not get in to the notes because the itinerary was open and probably someone was working on my request. He said that he would check in about 10-15 minutes and revert. As of 14th morning 10 am, there is no call to the number I had given them or email from Expedia.As Expedia Gold member, a regular customer for over 15 years, and a traveler in the middle of my travels, I am really vexed and disappointed by the way I have been treated.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative

They have a 24 hour cancellation guarantee on their website...what they do not tell you is if you cancel with the 24 hours, they will still charge your card for the trip and when you call weeks later because it has not been refunded, they will tell you it will be 8 weeks before a refund can be issued...so they are essentially ""using"" your money for over 2 months.  Does that sound like a financially viable company to you?  Sounds like a racket to me.  Guess who pays credit card interest on this charge while you are waiting over 2 months?

I said, it's fine please tell me how much I need to pay as my Mom is sick. Then again after another hour they told me it can not be done. What ??? After 11 hours on phone you are telling me it can not be done. They suggested me to buy another ticket and cancel this one.  Anyways, as my Mom was sick, I bought a new ticket ASAP. Then I followed up with Expedia again to cancel the previous ticket. Again after around 7-8 hours of torture on phone. They finally told me the amount I can get back is $4????? $4??? Really. I spend $1000 plus on round trip ticket. And they are saying it's $4? And above all the same thing they could have done in 30 minutes too that too at max. No???So please, please, please. Never book any ticket from Expedia and if you do because of any reason ... never call them. They are worthless. I will tell you the pattern. You call somebody.

I overheard her name was Ms Wee and was throwing her company name around which was Expedia Australia trying to threaten to hotel and I believe she was Singaporean unfortunately. I think she was not there on a business trip but personal. I wasn't sure what was the altercation was about but the hotel manager and staff were clearly very apologetic and apparently apologised in writing/card to which the letter/card was torn up by Ms Wee and sent back to the hotel manager. Such shameful behaviour from an employee from Expedia who is supposed to promote hospitality and friendliness. I hope Expedia Australia (at least I think she's from there)  management does a better job in hiring people. After witnessing such unprofessionalism from an Expedia employee who clearly was abusing the company's name and reputation, it's no wonder people are hardly using Expedia these days. I for one cannot trust my travels or anything for that matter with Expedia any longer. PLEASE Expedia, screen who you recruit properly in the future. Your customer service support isn't great already in the first place but knowing that your other employees also behaves this way is shocking.

I first call the hotel, the guy who was working was very unfriendly and would not cooperate with us in any fashion other than telling us to call Expedia.  I asked for a manager, he refused to give me one and said she left for the night, would not make the effort to get one on the phone or solve the problem.  It was very unprofessional.  I called Expedia and waited on the phone on hold on and off for hours, they did not have a plan together on transferring us to another hotel and were very unprofessional.  They finally found us a hotel, still charged an extra rate on top of the going hotel price and would not give us a discount or comp the rooms due to the inconvenience.  I finally cancelled the rooms and called the same hotel and booked them at a cheaper price after a very long night at midnight.  The whole night was a nightmere and I am very disappointed with the fact that our room was rented out from under us, it nearly ruined our trip.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

1688	            I spent over three days trying to book a holiday with Expedia, after having taken advice from them in the first place. Was told to book the room first and then when ready to book flights i was told to cancel the room and rebook it all as a package getting the package discount. However cancelled the room then tried to rebook it as a package, was then told not available! i rebooked the same room via a conference call with Expedia and directly with the hotel, finally managed this then told by the flights department that as i booked the room this was not available as a package, to which i told them that expedia booked it and i wanted the flights to go with it. Spoke to several different mangers/supervisors each one promised you the world but delivered **** all! Call you back they would sort it no problem! LIARS, I eventually after two days and repeating the whole order with many members of staff whom all must of gone to the same training course all of one hour! i gave up spoke to the hotel directly and told them to reserve the room in which they told me i would have to cancel the booking with Expedia and then book directly with them afterwards. After another 2 hours on the phone explaining this again to several different people they said i didn't have a booking with them!! At this stage after falling off my chair, i left them too it and can honestly say i would never never go anywhere near them again and have strongly recommended any family friends from doing the same!I wish i read the reviews prior to going to them in the first place!

1689	"            First, we booked with them and they booked our hotel on the wrong day. We called and they said they changed the date and emailed us a new confirmation. Last night we arrived at the hotel in a torrential downpour and were told that all they had was a cancellation from Expedia for the night they accidentally booked. They never called the hotel to change the date, just cancelled!!!  The hotel had no rooms left for two adults and 2 teens. We tried to call them and they said they would return our call in 35 minutes. In the meantime, we had to get back in our car in super bad weather and try to find another hotel. Finally w did and we had to fork over more money. Still no call-back! We called and finally got someone but they hung up on us. We called again and the person said that the hotel cancelled the reservation due to late arrival. LIARS!!!  Our confirmation clearly states ""•Your room will be guaranteed for late arrival."" So this person busted themselves in their lie. Who knows when the money will be returned to us. I'm sure it will be a battle to get it back. Do yourself a favor and NEVER use Expedia!

1691	"            I used to enjoy using Expedia as they are so easy to book a reasonably priced holiday package, but I've now learnt you are far better off using their site to gain ideas but please, save yourself unnecessary stress and DO NOT book through them.I booked a full trip to Hong Kong with them including a hotel and return flights, and have unfortunately had to cancel. Upon cancellation they told me the hotel was non-refundable but the flights are.. I checked the official hotel website of who I booked through and the hotel itself DOES allow full refunds, providing sufficient notice is given (which I have), but because I booked through stupid Expedia, I cannot get a refund. In other words, the money I paid is just being hoarded by Expedia and does not even go to the hotel!!Anyhow, I arranged a cancellation/refund of my flights a month ago now and was advised I would receive a refund in 3-7 days. Never came. I also never received a cancellation confirmation. Called again and was then advised a ""technical error"" had occurred and the customer service agent said he had ""escalated"" my case and I would receive a refund in 3-7 days. I requested a cancellation confirmation also and the customer service agent said ""unfortunately I have already sent the email to management, you should have told me you'd like a confirmation before I sent it off."" What the hell!? .. I shouldn't HAVE to ask for confirmation!! I called yet AGAIN with less patience, letting them know that I NEED this money back and it's getting ridiculous. The agent AGAIN told me a ""technical error"" had occurred and this is why I have not received my money back. Well if an error is constantly occurring.. why am I not being advised!? .. She then told me exactly what the previous agent had told me and that she would have it escalated and I would receive the funds in 7-15 days (originally it was 3-7 days!) .. I asked for an email confirmation of this and she asked ""what exactly do you want me to send you?"" I cannot BELIEVE customers have to TELL them how to do their job properly!!!She finally agreed to send one with much reluctance and then I receive half an email, broken off which does not list specifics, which she had clearly typed up herself in poor English. I told her this and she laughed at me saying ""why would I send you half an email?""Totally unprofessional. Huge money making sham. NIL customer service. Customer service agents speak broken English.I am STILL waiting on my money back. I will NEVER use them again. Please, book with airlines and hotels directly.

1692	            I had a horrible experience with Expedia. I booked a 2 stars hotel in San Francisco with them. It cost me over $327 for 2 nights. When I got there I found that it was a motel in an area full of bums and prostitutes. Some were sitting across our room.The hall smelled of urine and the floor was full of water and trash. The room was dirty. The furniture in the room looked like 2nd hand and the bed covers had holes in them. We were told the area is unsafe for walking. We called Expedia to see if they can relocate us, but they left us on the phone for long time and at the end said they could not do anything. We went to the motel's office to ask if we can check out and get our money back, but was refused by the person there, saying it was non-refundable. I tried to call Expedia a few times. In all the times, I was put on hold for a long time and did not get any help. Eventually, I just went downstairs, handed the keys to the guy in the office and left. It was lucky a relative helped us find another hotel. Needless to say it looks like I will never see my money again, since Expedia was unhelpful and refused to help us get our money back from the hotel.I cannot believe Expedia sells such dump on their website. Unbelievable.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative
1693	            If you have credit from previously cancelled trip, you have to re-book airplane ticket from them. After you searched their website for the flights that fit your schedule, you have to call their agent (in India) to use your credit. The agent will tell you the flights of your choice are no longer available. They then direct you a flight with multiple stops and higher price. The goal is to squeeze more money from you in addition to the $200 penalty. When you complain that the flight of your choice is still on the website, he claims that the flight and price are not guaranteed. This is what happened to me. This is bad business practice, I will never use Expedia again. Fool me twice shame on me!        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative

1695	            Booked round trip tickets from Beirut to Rio De Janeiro with my columbian passport. Everything was fine during booking and payment. My return flight had a connexion in Europe that required a Schengen Visa.At no point was I warned during my booking, I discovered I couldn't board the plane to get home AT THE RIO AIRPORT.I had to stay 15 000 miles away from home in order to change my flight with the airline.Called Expedia's customer service for the compensation on my return. They refused to refund the ticket change and to compensate for the extra 4 days that I had to stay in Brazil.Their excuse was an obscure term in their policy that said travelers need to have the appropriate documents to travel. It was stated nowhere that my columbian passport needed a visa to do the connexion, neither did I get a warning at the time of booking.Horrible experience, my advice to anyone would be to never use them.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	neutral
1696	            Expedia is a money grabbing churn and burn machine. My advice would be to use it as a resource but to never book through it. You will invariably be ripped off as you realise upon arrival that the room rates are cheaper, or that a 'Double' room is in fact two single beds that you can't negotiate. Most frustrating is the complete lack of customer service. It is a faceless organisation with no real platform to cater to client feedback, when you manage to locate a number, calls go unanswered, as do emails with no follow-up whatsoever.Having relied upon Expedia for flights and accommodation, our South American experience was utterly soured as we were continuously let down throughout our travels due to this poor service.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
1697	            Two months ago, I booked an international flight ticket for my Mom coming from Egypt to US in Oct 2014. I Specifically chose this flight because it will have a 3 hours lay-over only. My mom is old and her legs hurt her and cannot stay more than 3-4 hrs waiting at the airport. Now they called me telling that the airline change this flight and the lay-over time will be 13 hrs and their is no any other options !!!! I found a flight coming from the same airport with only 3 hours layover time on thier website ..they refused to change the ticket without fees and they offered a hotel for here... During transfering my call to the hotel reservation department, the call is dropped and I redailed them again.. a new customer care representer told me we cant do anything for you just accept the 13 hrs waiting orcanceling the ticket and refund!!!!!! While waiting for 45 mins, I checkedthe flight rates for the same trip, i found that it will be at least $300-400 difference to buy another ticket... I asked to talk with a manger or a supervisor , one guy closed the line in my face...another one put me on hold for 40 mins then the called dropped.. aftr this i called them again and i asked to solve the problem or i will call the police, they tansfer me to a guy who intoduce him self as a supervisor , he told me the system is broken and he cannot do any thing now and take my phone number to call me after fixing the system..after 2 hrs he called me asking about the problem and after i told him the story ( for the 7th time during two days) he puts me on waiting and the call is dropped !!!I dont know what can I do..but this will be the last time to book through this crabby company!        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1698	            I now understand why Expedia is rated 14th of 14.I booked a Budget rental car through Expedia, one way rental with 250 miles between origin and destination.  The booking stated a total price of $122.99, but the actual Budget contract allowed 100 free miles, and $.35/mile beyond 100 miles.  There was no mention of these terms in the confirmation, therefore the quoted price could NEVER have been accurate.  I have used Expedia many times in the past with no such problems.  Now it appears one must be wary of hidden fees and dig into the details to protect yourself.... which cancels out the point of using a service like Expedia in the first place.  Budget essentially told me to get lost.  I've now been on the phone with Expedia for 1 hour 8 minutes and counting (currently on hold) and the best they've offered so far is a couple of coupons of no value to me.  Expedia is not worth it.

Therefore, they did not notify me.  I asked for compensation, as  my family had a TWELVE HOUR layover in Atlanta(with a 6 year old, no less).  They supervisor, ""Ange"", was sarcastic.  She offered my a $100. voucher and later offered a $50. voucher.  When I asked about the change, she told me ""I can give you the $50. voucher, if that is what you want.""  Then explained to me, TWICE,  that $100. was more than $50.   Very condescending, and, took no responsibility for the problem. I will only use Expedia to see what flights are out there, and then book with the airline.  Delta emails, calls, etc. to make sure you are aware of changes.

1709	"            I wish I had found trustpilot before booking on expedia, as I can only second the experiences shared here so far.I'm trying to change a flight and am experiencing the worst customer experience that I've had the pleasure of encountering so far. As pointed out by others, at the first stage you'll be talking to an agent, who neither has a clue nor has any rights to make any alterations. They WILL SEND YOU TO HELPDESK, which is another 20-40 minutes of waiting time. Once you've reached their ""supervisor"", things will slow down even more. Even for the most trivial alterations to a flight (shift by one week, same route, months in advance) it takes them forever to get any quote. The best she could come up with before the call dropped was a quote of 2000-5000 USD, even though booking a NEW ROUNDTRIP on the date in question and back two weeks later would cost 1000USD on priceline! I'm not sure if I can trust my ears, but I think she said something about ""getting a quote involves a whole lot of FAXING with the airline""!!! Welcome to the 80s. After all this, the call dropped, I even got a call-back that rang for a fraction of a second (and then hung up) and now I'm spending the second hour in their phone system.Verdict: Do NOT EVER book with Expedia unless you have no respect for your own time.update: call dropped a second time!!! two hours wasted, flight unchanged!update 2: call was dropped a third and final time. gave up on expedia and directly called airfrance. flight was changed within 20 minutes for 200USD. expedia, never again.

1710	            I booked the flight of June 7, 2014 through Expedia but couldn't take the flight because of the visa issue. When I tried to re-book the flight Expedia told me the ticket has lost the value. It's a $943 ticket!! However, I called the airline company 3 times for this specific situation and was told the ticket still have value and gonna be expired on June 7, 2015! The worst part is I called Expedia customer service many times for the rebook. Every time the call need to be transferred to supervisor and the average waiting time is 30+ mins. Upon the rules of Expedia the supervisor needs to contact airline company for re-booking. Than the only thing I can do is to wait and stay on the line (usually it's another 40+ min). However, the call is always disconnected during the waiting and I NEVER got the call from Expedia. So I have to call them back and repeat the same procedure and answer the same questions from customer service representative each single time. I really don't know if it will be solved but it's 100% sure I'll stop using Expedia's service which started on 2008.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	neutral
1711	"            I am not sure where to begin but totally agree with all of the reviews - Expedia is the worst company ever!  I rented a car from Avis through the Expedia website and purchased insurance at the same time.   When we arrived at our destination to pick up the car we were informed by the Avis representative that they do not partner with Expedia and that they would not recognize the insurance policy we'd purchased.  They insisted we purchase another policy through them or we could not rent the car.  They informed us we should contact Expedia upon our return and ask for a refund.  When I called Expedia they placed me on eternal hold and when they returned to the line they said they had no record of the insurance policy I had purchased.  When I provided them with the confirmation number they placed me on eternal hold again.  When they finally came back on line I asked to speak with a supervisor and again they placed me on hold.  In between the times I was placed on hold I ""spoke"" with an individual I could hardly understand and whose voice echoed when she spoke.  I did not get anywhere and will not receive my refund for sure.  It is an unbelievable racket and rip off!  The amount for the car they quoted was incorrect and they sold us insurance that was no good.  Not only were they rude and unprofessional but one could say fraudulent as well.  Bev S.

When I got to the hotel, they said the hotel was full (even though I had a reservation for 5 nights) and they put me into their ""sister"" property next door, the Abey Hotel.  Well, it is their ugly sister - the place is a real dump and the room I was allocated was incredibly small, dirty, and had no window.  When I complained about this, I was told that both hotels were full and this was the only room available, and there was nothing they could do today, but they would move me tomorrow.  The next day, they did move me into the Cambridge, but they charged me an extra nightly fee to stay in the Cambridge.  I called Expedia about this as my booking was for a 5 night stay at the Cambridge Hotel and all I got was the run-around and an agent who was unable to understand my problem even after 18 minutes of explanation.  This was after 35 minutes on hold.  I would never stay at the Abey, or use Expedia to make a Unpublished Rate booking, or any booking for that matter as all they are interested in is making bookings online.

Email to Expedia has not resulted any better than bunch of apologies and feeling sorry messages with no clear indication of what next.Here goes my storyToday [07/09], I have the most horrible experience with Expedia.

I was there to assist my father and see him off for flight 491. As I showed the confirmation email from Expedia to the Lufthansa folks, they said they have no idea about the ticket. There is no ticket booked in the passengers’ name. Lufthansa asked me to call Expedia.There starts my classic phone call to Expedia customer care. By any standard, Expedia’s first line customer care is ignorant, poorly trained and does not know how to handle the case, when the customer is there in the airport and every minute counts. The agent, who was talking to me at the beginning, kept on blaming Lufthansa for the situation. Couple of time, I handed over the call to Lufthansa Help person. They keep on blaming each other. All this was happening, while I am counting minutes as the flight departure time was fast approaching. The Expedia Agent kept me on hold for numerous time to get back to me with no clear indication of whether I am missing the flight or have any chance of getting into the flight .At one point he said, its Lufthansa who has initiated a Schedule change and cancellation for the ticket, so they should refund or arrange for the ticket. As the time was fast passing, I requested the agent to connect to his supervisor. It took at least 10 to 15 minutes to talk to his supervisor.There starts my firsthand experience of second line of defense of Expedia. Man! This person (2nd agent) so arrogant and with full of attitude. Yes! He was talking to me as though he is ready to rattle me. Rather than, listening to me, he started blaming me for the situation. However, He gave little more insight into the situation. Did I tell you, by this time it was already 1 hour of conversation with Expedia? I was getting sure, my father cannot fly today. Here is the situation; I called Expedia to cancel another ticket on 07/05. Customer care cancelled this one by mistake. Let us get back to conversation with the second agent. I told him, I had given 3 piece of information when I called for cancellation of another ticket – Passengers Name, Travel Date and Itinerary no. How everything can be wrong? The second agent was literally harassing me to agree to him that it is my mistake that I asked to cancel another ticket. It was so much so that I had to request to pass on the call his supervisor. He started heckling me saying, why I need to talk to my boss. I insisted I want to talk to his boss. At one point, I had to say him, “You must not be the VP of Customer care - Expedia. If not, then please pass the call to your manager”. Then, he agreed and asked me to wait for the supervisor. There starts again a wait of 5 to 10 minutes.I was connected to the supervisor of second agent – the 3rd Agent. By this time, I knew its Expedia who by mistake cancelled my father’s flight. And pushing me into hour-long phone call with no direction. The third agent sounds to be mature and patient. He was summarized about the situation, before the call began, hence was easy for me to proceed with the conversation. Again, call went for next 30 minute or so. He told me that he is doing the tax calculations to find exact refund amount. He opened Case no [E6991338], while me being in the call. Lastly, he said it would take 72 hours to resolve the case. By the time call ended, I was extremely exhausted and upset with EXPEDIA.This mistake of Expedia has caused my father a lot of problem, as he cannot attend one of the social commitment he made as per the plan. I will certainly be pissed if Expedia higher authority does not look into the issue and take appropriate action immediately. Even now, I do not how the case is going to be resolved.I find this as classic poor customer care Evidence. There are tons of pockets for improvement. I have been loyal customer of Expedia for last 3 years. Every time I travel, there would something or other problem. Let me list down, my suggestions.1. The first line of customer care agents have very poor English knowledge. Sometime, they can’t comprehend what the customer is saying. I have spoken to customer care who does not have right words for them to express what they want to say. Most of them have very poor knowledge about the Airline industry .Not to pick on their pathetic pronunciation.2. Most of the first line of customer care are not trained to handle the emergency like, customer calling from airport while waiting for flight. At that point customer needs clarity on the situation, not glossy apathetic statements like “I AM SORRY” or “I UNDERSTAND”3. Supervisor of first line customer care: I have to talk to these folks on couple of occasions. In all cases, I found them extremely anti customer. They talk in a bullying tone and try blaming the customer rather understanding the situation. Are they trained to be like that? Talking to these are always a harsh experience.4. Third line of customer care (Boss of 2nd line): Customer care from corporate office. This was my first time I spoke to the third line. However, this person sounds like much in control and authority. But there is so much that can be improved.a. Customer do not need to be there in the call when he opens ticketb. 72 hours to resolve a ticket – Are you kidding?c. Why not an email notification on my complain?5. In case of cancellation, Why not a proactive call from Expedia to customers. Confirming /informing the cancellation6. Why the cancellation emails has only Itinerary no. Why not Customer name, Flight details? Do you expect the customers to remember 15 digit itinerary no7. Over all experience of Expedia, customer care is degrading day by day.I got a call back from Expedia on 07/11, they agreed that it’s clearly their fault. Here is what they said1. They investigated and agreed that it’s clearly Expedia's mistake2. They are going to book the one way flight for my father any date I pick .Expedia will charge me only the amount they refund by mistake, reminder will be paid by Expedia. Having said that no change in class [Business/Economy] is allowed.3. They will cancel my mom's ticket and refund money after penalty. [This is the one for which I called Expedia to cancel]My departing notes to Expedia: Expedia missed its opportunity of wowing me. Though Expedia resolved the issue, they missed a big opportunity to impress customer and set high standard for themselves. They did nothing special to get the customer back to them again. Expedia just did a patchy fix for a broken relation, which they are the one to blame on. On no fault of the customer, customer suffered anxiety and loss of energy, time and valuable peace. Is this a company who is shooting for global presence? Personally boycotting Expedia for rest of my life. They are not the only one in the industry.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative
1718	"            I am extremely frustrated with Expedia website and support services. On Sunday July 6, 2014 I attempted to make a reservation for that evening (July 6th) at a hotel. However after putting in my information and pressing confirm, I immediately received a notification that that I was confirmed for a reservation on August 25, 2014. Confused by this, I immediately called the hotel who then redirected me to the expedia support services to help. When I spoke to the customer service agent, I was assured a full refund would be reimbursed to me the following day when the supervisor was in and able to authorize it. After receiving no call to that effect I called today (July 10) to be told that no refund would be given and that it was not Expedia's fault by supervisor ""Alexander"" even though I never intended to make a reservation (nor will I be in that city) on August 25th. This was an appalling experience.        "	                2	1	Thursday	expedia	neutral
1719	            I will never use Expedia ever again, I had the worst experience I have ever had booking an airline ticket. First I booked the ticket online, easy, got a confirmation and itenary. Went out for the day to come home to an email saying the ticket could not be processed as my card was declined, checked my credit card online and it had already been charged! Wtf so I called them and had a very long and anoying conversation with someone in New Delhi India who didnt seem to care. Apparently expedia charges the card and than the airline also charges the card so you need double the amount of the tickets available on your credit card, go figure, nowere was this advised to me while making the booking so I only transfered thwe amount of the actual ticket into my account, in the end I had to give my credit card details over the phone and hope that it all gets sorted out, I was told this could take up to 48 hours to be confirmed because the fare might go up and I will have to pay extra! Worst company I have ever used and will never use them again! Just look at there other reviews! You have been warned!        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
1720	            DON'T BUY ANYTHING WITH EXPEDIA...I will never purchase anything thru Expedia ever again. Tried to cancel a thicket of $536 that I purchased for my husband, 10 days before the flight and they would not refund my money. They will sell that thicket for even a higher amount after I cancel, I even offered to pay a cancelation fee to have some of the amount refunded, but they said no. That is the tactic here; for you to not be able to cancel anything, if you do, you are loosing your money and they are making more on you!!! Things happen and circumstances change all the time, so they have to have a conscience that not everyone has money to throw away on thickets that they won't be able to use!!!! I lost my money and that is unacceptable to me... I urge everyone to go straight to the Airline and have that safety net that if your situation change you will pay a fee and have at least some of your money back!!!        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative

I called the hotel and spoke with the woman whom expedia called- she relayed that they can cancel or change it at no fee.  Ok- expedia lied and most likely had the web site set up this way intentially.

Banging on my door at night, trying to break in and use their hotel card to get into my apartment.Not only did the hotel management help (They called ""security"" yet the noise/banging on my doors lasted from 12:30am-4:30am) but Expedia says they cannot control the people who stay at the hotels.  Rightfully so, BUT THEY CAN CONTROL MANAGEMENT!  If the management in the hotel is unresponsive and un attentive WHY WOULD YOU USE THEM AS A RESOURSE? It is not acceptable to feel unsafe, scared, and of course not get a second of sleep in the middle of the night because people are being wreckless in the hotel.Don't trust Expedia.com .. they don't care about the people, just the $$.  This experience in general was not worth it.  ESPECIALLY NOT FOR A HOTEL THAT CHARGED $250/Night!The room wasn't ideal, half the lights were out... I could go on.. and following up with expedia I had to repeat myself and my experience every time I called, which to me was unpleasant and uncomfortable.

The tour was full and they only offered half of the tour. Two months later and after calling Expedia multiple times they offered to reimburse only $100.00. I paid for the tour $1068.00. They stole my money.  A supervisor even said that he couldn’t speak with the agency in Paris because the day he called no one speak English  in the agency and I guess that nobody in Expedia speaks French.

1729	            I recently booked a business class ticket on Expedia traveling to Europe.  I had to cancel and rebook.  I was on the phone 5 different times and each time I encountered a foreigner who couldn't understand I wanted to travel to Nice not Venice.  One even went so far as to book the Venice ticket even after I gave him the airport code.  When I finally got on the line and did the booking I found the itinerary I wanted on their website and saved it in my itinerary so they could see exactly what I was looking for.  They were not able to bring up the flights and see what I was seeing on their website.  They finally came back (after almost two hours on the phone and multiple 20 minute holds and told me I would have to pay an additional $4,400 even though I was on their website and the cost shown was $4,400 less.

Today I experienced one of the most rude, frustrating, and incompetent booking transactions of my entire life. I have never been so offended by the lack of business integrity and customer service. I was on on phone with a booking agent so long that I  was charged an extra $100 for a flight while they tried to sort themselves out. Not only was I charged more money than was advertised, I spent one and a half hours on the phone trying to speak to a manager who could make things right. I was blown off, disconnected, and told that there was nothing they were willing to do on their end to compensate me for time and money lost. Without a doubt, Expedia is the worst way to arrange travel plans available.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

A window appeared saying 'processing...' And stayed there for eight minutes.  I telephoned Expedia helpline to confirm if the booking had or had not gone through,  it took a further five minutes on the phone repeating everything i was asked at least twice over. Eventually they found my attempted booking and confirmed it hadn't gone through because ... Get this ... The price had just gone up and the system couldn't confirm the purchase at the stated price!  I was asked if i would like to go ahead and confirm the booking at the new price over the phone ... Oh yeah, right.

I was trying to cancel the reservation after they found it ( I had to call the hotel and get the expedia reservation number because expedia had  no record of it) but they said if I cancelled I had to pay the entire night anyway . $500.00. I was trying to get a bigger room, and expedia said I could only get a bigger room if I paid $876.00. Heck no. I called the hotel and they said they could give me the same exact room for 600.00. I was furious. Expedia was going to pocket 276.00 of the room. They are unfair, and unhelpful. My hotel is the one who finally came through an solved everything.

1734	            We booked a trip months ago for a trip in a few weeks, and upon checking to make sure we still have our seating assignments (they screwed it up last year too), we found that we no longer had any seating assignments. Mind you, we're travelling with a minor. So I called Expedia to find out what happened and they said seating assignments are not guaranteed. So I asked: Then why do you allow people to choose them? No answer. She suggested I call the airline. So I did.Airline rep told me Expedia cancelled (yes cancelled) our seat assignments when they had a schedule change, which we were never notified of. She said they aren't supposed to do that. So, our seats were given away and now the flight is booked. Angry, I called Expedia back to talk to a supervisor who kept talking over me, and subsequently hung up on me. Unbelievable. So I called corporate in Washington. Go ahead, try it. You hit 0 to be connected to an operator and will be sitting with a ringing phone forever. I held out 10 minutes just to see how long it would be. Never an answer. Called back twice, same thing. Next, I emailed and left a message for their SVP Operations (found his info online). No call back, no email back. I am at a loss. I have used Expedia for years, and will NEVER use them again. They are a horrible company with NO customer service at all. I hope they go down, badly. They deserve it.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
1735	            I was in a very difficult situation where my passport somehow got lost in the mail and did not arrive in time for my flight to Italy.  I called expedia 3 days before to see what my options were for sticky situations such as my own and I talked to a very friendly, helpful man who told me that I could cancel my ticket and receive airline credit for the flight.  Then, since I had no idea when the passport was going to arrive, I could call them when it eventually did and book another flight.  He told me to wait til 2 hours before the flight to make sure that my passport still didn't come and then cancel the flight.  He also told me that he would put a note on my account so that the person that I called on the day of would already be informed about my unfortunate situation.  The day of my departure arrived and my passport still didn't come, so I called expedia nice and early to see about canceling the flight.  First of all they had no records or notes on my account about my previous conversation, and they told me that canceling and receiving airline credit was never an option.  On top of that, I was never able to speak to someone who actually spoke proper English and I kept asking to talk with supervisors and was basically put on hold for 2 hours. 3 hours later I was talking with someone from their corporate office and she told me that I barely had any time even to change the flight, let alone cancel the reservation!  They were all very rude and very unhelpful.  Not only that, they do not train their staff enough to give correct information from each agent.  Instead, each agent will tell you a different story.  They have treated me not only without sympathy for my stressful situation, but also with disrespect.

I was told finally that I did not get the credit because they did not get a redemption form they sent me on e-mail.  I actually did fill out that form and sent it back the day I received it.  They wanted proof.  What proof is there of that?  They asked what message I received when the form was submitted (months ago).  I didn't know of course -- so they said, so sorry,  you get nothing.

1751	            The sites Expedia and Getaroom.com screwed us over. They sent us to other providers trying to figure out who had our reservation. So we had to cancel our rooms so we could redo our reservation. BUT it turns out they get our money within an hour but when we try to cancel, they get to keep it for ten days before returning it to us. Now we don't have our money or our vacation.

1752	"            So, I booked our Hawaii trip through Expedia and once we got to Oahu (connecting to Maui) we started looking for the Airline, Go! ... A guy from Alaska tells me they went out of business April 1st!! I booked the flight 2 weeks before that! You're telling me Expedia couldn't contact me to tell me?? So, it happened to be graduation weekend and there were no flights to Maui for 2 days! I was on the phone with Expedia for 4 hours trying to get help and they kept hanging up on me and I would get a new person every time I called ... They would never have record of who I talked to and didn't have any names that the ""supervisors"" gave me.  Finally I ended up re-booking my flight on my own and found a condo in Oahu ..$1500.00 later! AND I lost my car in Maui... Dollar wouldn't hold it for me. So, this cost me clots to $1800.00. Plus the money for the first flight I'm out. Expedia didn't help me at all... They said if I send in my flight receipt via fax they will reimburse me, but that's it. And I won't hold my breath! This ruined our vacation as we were so stressed out and afraid for what would happen on our trip home we couldn't even relax. Thanks Expedia.        "	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative

On arrival in Tarbert I could not locate Anchor Hotel. At the Tourist Information Centre I was told that this had happened before. Anchor Hotel is not on the Isle of Harris but in Tarbert, County of Argyl, a ferry passage and 100 miles distant. No point contacting the hotel because they have a 48 hr 100% cancellation fee. Expedia customer service refuses to recognize that they supplied me with incorrect information regarding the hotel. Expedia customer service representative was extremely exasperating because he would only repeat the fact that they would not issue a refund and refused to listen to my attempts to explain the problem.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative
1754	            Using expedia was the worst decision ever because My wife and I booked a flight ahead of time to only have it changed. We had a flight that was only supposed to be 6 hours. This included a lay over. Why oh why I get to the airport to find out my flight was cancelled. Then my wife and I had to wait through a couple of delays . Needless to say it took us 18hours to get where we needed to be. Then on the way back home they split us up and I was furious about this because we booked seats right next to each other.   Just book directly though the airline it's the best bet.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
1755	"            I called into Expedia about a car rentalI had booked for my mother in law who was coming to visit us for our children's birthday. I booked online through the expedia for TD site to take advantage of my TD rewards points. My rental was a reservation only and still required me to go to the airport and pay the car rental company which was not communicated to me until after my mother in law landed and went to the car rental agency. I contacted expedia and was met with an extremely unhelpful agent that showed no empathy in our situation. We then spoke to a supposed Supervisor who continued to recite the same policy over and over and was unwilling to empathize or come to middle ground. We asked for our points to be put back onto our credit card as we were unable to complete our reservation and pay the car rental company as our mother in law already provided her license and credit card for the reservation. The Expedia ""Supervisor"" advised they couldn't put the points back and had to escalate to TD rewards. We then asked for his agent ID# to hold him accountable for ensuring this escalation takes place and he refused. We asked to speak with his superior and who he reports to and he advised he doesn't have a boss. This was an awful customer experience and am completely disgusted at the treatment of their customers and lack of accountability. I will never deal with Expedia again and wi be sharing my poor experience and lack of resolution with anyone that will listen.        "	                2	1	Thursday	expedia	neutral
1756	            After reading all bad reviews here I wondered how the travel protection plan would work out for us. Our experience was good. We purchased our tickets to Europe for the whole family back in February with the travel protection plan. It said if any of our immediate family members get sick and unable to travel they pay back the money we spent on our non-refundable airline tickets. Sure enough, a week before the journey we got a virus and my wife and son got real sick. I made sure we visited the doctors one day before our planned journey and let them both fill out the claim form. (I could not download it from the site, they sent that via email.) I cancelled the flights via Expedia, filled out the form and they sent the checks in a week. The bad. When I called them they hinted that we could rebook our tickets and they would pay then the rebooking fees AND the price difference between our old tickets and new tickets as long as that difference is less than the price of the original tickets. When I checked the actual explanation of benefits document I could not find it there. I tried to email about this and have this promise in writing. They replied only that I should call them. After the third call they acknowledged that this option does not exist. If I had believed that at the first place, we could've lost everything except the rebooking fees. Read the explanation of benefits carefully. What is not there is not covered by the policy.        	                1	4	Wednesday	expedia	neutral

1758	"            Where to start? I'll keep it brief:1. My flight had been cancelled a week earlier and THEY HAD NO IDEA. I had to spend 30 minutes convincing them to call Aer Lingus, which they finally did. When they got back on the phone: ""Oh, you're right, it was cancelled.""2. Then I couldn't get another flight that day because they didn't believe me that there was an 8 p.m. flight. I had to spend another 45 minutes convincing ANOTHER REP to call Aer Lingus. He finally did, but by that point, the 2 seats that Aer Lingus told me they had left were gone. I literally had to give the rep the phone number to Aer Lingus because they didn't have a fresh one. Pathetic! Time was wasted that could have been spent getting those two seats.3. They STILL haven't cancelled my cancelled flight, United is saying they haven't bought my tickets yet, and the whole thing is just a TERRIBLE MESS.Shame, shame, shame on Expedia!

1759	            I rented a car in Seville, Spain. Expedia said ti was from the Dollar Rental Car company. At the airport, there is no Dollar counter. After asking at all the other counters the people at the Hertz/Thrifty counter finally figured out it was them. Even if we had wanted to call, we were not provided with an in-country phone number. I can't find a place to complain on the Expedia site, which suggests that they mess up so much that they are hiding from customers.

At the end, I asked to talk to a manager, she said no manager is working at this time and she's the supervisor. Sounded like there was nobody above her there.

1763	"            Had recently booked a trip from Malaysia to Brussels on Expedia, based on their cheapest recommended option, we selected our flight. Payment made through credit card and a confirmation was sent via email stating clearly that booking is CONFIRMED and there is not need to call to reconfirm the bookings. 4 days after making the bookings I decided to just call, seeing that it was my first time using Expedia. After numerous steps on their Automated response I finally got through a human and enquired about my curiousity only to be told that the calls had gone through to the ""hotels"" department and that they will direct me to the ""flights"" department. After a short wait, I was assisted by a rather pleasant gentleman who I addressed my queries to. After somemore short minutes, I was told that there is no confirmed booking despite me quoting my itinerary number. So after some more checking and being put on hold for about 10 minutes, again I was told that there was no booking in my name and that's when it all started. 45 minutes later I was told to make an official complaint via email. That done, I called after an hour to follow up, I was put on hold for 45 minutes and then hung up on. Followed by another call only to be told the same thing that at the time of my booking, the system didn't process and I needed to pay an additional sum of money to book a different flight. WHY??!! After 45 minutes more, I was told I would get a call back which only happened after I had made numerous other calls demanding an answer as my flight was 5 days away. NEVER AGAIN.

I booked another flight on another carrier to get where I needed to go.  It was an additional booking through Expedia. I have been requesting a refund for my original flight for over a month now and I keep getting pushed. Over and over they tell me they understand my feelings... but nothing gets resolved.  I have now been on the phone again for the third time and two weeks, for over an hour and still no resolution. They keep saying the airline needs to refund my flight, but they can't get in touch with the airline.

1767	"            Absolutely terrible experience.I made the booking for a non-smoking suite. I even wrote in the ""notes"" area, before clicking submit, that the room MUST be non-smoking due to allergies.We arrive at the hotel at 8:30pm, exhausted after traveling all day. We spend 30 minutes or so unloading our car onto a cart and checking in. Immediately upon walking into our suite, we were hit with the incredibly strong stench of smoke. It was almost unbearable. We immediately called down to guest services and were told that Expedia never relayed the message for a non-smoking room or the additional notes regarding the need for a non-smoking room. She said this happens all the time with Expedia but that the hotel was booked solid and there were no additional rooms available.I immediately called Expedia. I explained the issue and said that we needed another room large enough to fit all of us + the dog at a comparable or greater hotel. The woman I spoke with came back after a few minutes on hold to tell me that she found a hotel. A hotel in, literally, the absolute worst neighborhood in the entire city. I wouldn't drive through there at night. I certainly wouldn't allow anyone in my family to sleep there. But the woman on the phone assured me it was the ONLY option. (And that it was cheaper - only $200 for both nights! Clearly it WASN'T comparable.)I told her to look up a specific hotel that I had been looking at just prior to booking this one via Expedia. She said there was one room available with one bed. Not going to work for us. She assured me that was the only thing available and that it would be much more expensive so she'd need to ""see if"" the original hotel would refund me and then I could book the new hotel. I was on hold for so long that I had someone else call the new hotel (Sheraton) on another phone. Within a minute, we had a new room at the new hotel. A much larger room. The people we spoke with at Sheraton said they've heard of similar issues with Expedia and they weren't surprised. They even advised me on exactly how to handle things should I have issues with Expedia correcting the issue and needed to go the legal route. (Not that I needed that from them - I certainly was already thinking that would be how things were going to happen, as I was getting absolutely no guidance or help from Expedia at this point.)After ages, someone from Expedia came back on the line and assured me there was no way another, larger room (that would fit us all) was available at the Sheraton. I had to literally argue with the woman and tell her that I was on the other phone with the Sheraton. I told her that Expedia needed to either call the Sheraton now and book the room specified or they needed to refund me IMMEDIATELY so that I could do so and we could get out of the room.By this point, one of the adults was in the hallway with the child, sleeping on the floor (as it was around 10:30 by this time) because the the smoke was too strong in the bedroom. I had to stay in the room, coughing and hacking, while on the phone so I wouldn't disturb other guests.** Myself AND the six year old child are highly and incredibly allergic to cigarette smoke. Regardless of how many times I explained this to the people at Expedia (while urging them to hurry) - they did not seem to quite understand. I can only say that Expedia is lucky WE were able to take action on our own, otherwise Expedia would also need to fit our hospital bills as well. **Finally, after being on hold for a solid 30 minutes, we made the reservation for the new hotel on our own and headed back out to the car. Halfway to the new hotel, I was taken off of hold and a manager (or something) at Expedia said they could refund me half of my money (because we kept the booking for the TWO HOURS + that we were on the phone with Expedia) immediately. I assured her that wasn't possible. Either my entire balance would be refunded or they would call the hotel and pay for the new booking in its entirety. Looking for the cheaper way out, the manager said she would call the hotel. Of course, I knew they would refund me rather than pay for the new hotel as the balance to stay at the new hotel was over $700.A few minutes after being put on hold for the last time, over two hours after I had first made the phone call, around 1am, someone from the corporate office came on the phone and let me know that I had been refunded. She was well spoken, clear in her tone, kind, and informational. If only everyone I had spoken to up until that point would have been so easy to speak with - this entire mess could have been avoided, I imagine.My overall experience? Horrible. I will never use Expedia again. They need to REALLY figure out how to fix the MANY problems they seem to have as a company.        "	                2	1	Monday	expedia	positive

1770	"            Just had the worst experience with Expedia. I have plans to travel to Cabo in late July. Booked a reservation at the Grand Solmar, but before doing so I asked the Expedia representative to see if the Resort had any construction or renovation going on during the time I would be traveling. He assured me they don't but the next day I called the resort to double check and they said they have construction going on and they don't have a time frame when it would be done.Thank god I got the travel insurance and that Expedia has a 24 hour cancellation policy right....Wrong!!! I waited on hold for 45-60 minutes at a time and must have called 5-6 times through out the next day and couldn't get anyone on the line to cancel or even just change hotel. Funny how I could get a live representative to take a new reservation but couldn't get anyone to make a change or cancel a reservation. So when I could get through, the 24 hour grace period expired. They wouldn't honor it.But I'm still safe right, I got the full insurance policy that states for any reason you can change your reservation or even cancel, I might add its a $180 additional charge...wrong again, because I didn't pay in full...I opted to take advantage of their installment plan they wouldn't honor the insurance policy. So I then told them I will pay it in full so I can change the hotel....Umm no Sir I can not do that.So all in all, I'm stuck paying $3,000 dollars for a hotel that will be under construction, wasted over 6-8 hours trying to get through to Expedia only to be told by customer representative by the name of ""Uno"" employee number 0632537 I'm out of luck....by the way we got disconnected and he never bothered to call me back.....Lets see how long this posts stays up before they rip it down, thanks Expedia!!!

1771	            I booked a return flight from China to Italy on Expedia.com.hk last month. My booking was successful and it was confirmed with order no. 12632331395.Earlier this month I had to change my plans due to some serious circumstances. I called Expedia HK to inquire about cancellation of my order. An agent checked the order and told me I could cancel and get refund of ticket price minus EUR 125 as cancellation fee. I told him I accepted the cancellation fee, so he cancelled my order and told me I would soon receive an email confirming my cancellation and later I would get my refund. After several days I had received nothing so I called again. A different agent checked my order, confirmed that it had been cancelled and told me that there would be no refund because one of the airlines I was supposed to fly with had a no-refund clause and this policy would apply to the whole order. But, she cheerfully informed me, my cancellation had been successfully received and processed.I am very disappointed with this service. Had I known that I was going to lose the whole ticket, I would have considered a change of date instead of cancellation. Also, I find it unacceptable that they did not even bother to drop me an email after the request for refund had been rejected. I had to call again and spend additional time and money on the line while their agent was trying to find out what happened. If this is how Expedia handle changes, I believe they should honestly warn customers that bookings cannot be amended or cancelled for any reasons.I regularly use online agencies for my travel reservations.

I tried calling them less then 5 minutes after I booked, but none of the numbers listed on their costumer service web page actually worked, so I had to call the hotel (a super 8). they gave me a number to expedia, who after an hour on the line insisted there was no way to get a refund or even change the date. Feeling extra discouraged I called the super 8 again, and their manager told me that he personally talked to the expedia rep during the last hour while i was on hold in regards to my need and assured them it would be no problem to switch dates and pay the difference in room cost.

1778	            My husband and I booked a 2 night stay in February in Singapore. However we were delayed into Singapore due to my husband's ill health therefore had to cancel the first night. The hotel has been very understanding and has issued the refund but expedia still hasn't released it. I have gone around in circles for the past 2 and a half months trying to get this refund. First they tell me it's not possible then they say we have the money from the hotel so I give them credit card details to issue the refund to and it's been a month and guess what still no refund! I have never written a negative review for anything in my life. I don't normally expect much when it comes to customer service but these people have been extremely incompetent. Numerous emails and phone calls later each time back to where we started. I give them a zero star unfortunately        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

1780	            PLEASE do not use Expedia to conduct your transactions! Save your money, your time, and your sanity by going through a different agency.1. I bought an airline ticket, bought the travel insurance, and was able to gain a credit from the airline when I cancelled. However, Expedia, would not refund me the money and told me that their policy does not match the airline policy.2. I spoke to several supervisors who all provided me with ficticious first names and would not offer their last names. They told me that I did not know how to read and next time to read more closely (quite insulting).3. The representatives at Expedia are trained to follow a script and if you have a question they cannot answer, they will tell you to call back at a later time (this is after being on hold for 30 minutes).        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	positive
1781	            Went on line to book a hotel room.  Got tired of looking through all the comparisons so I decided to put in the name of the hotel. I thought I was on the hotels website. After all I put it in and was told it was the OFFICIAL website.  I filled out what I wanted for the price I expected to pay, then gave my CC information.  To my surprise not only did I not receive a page informing me the total of what my cost would be.  I ended up paying about $20.00 more than I expected to pay! I would NOT use this site! Do not even click it on!  They were sneaky about how they got me to use their service when I know for sure I was on the hotels website.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	neutral
1782	            I don't think I've ever seen such a poor level of service. I called Expedia to apply Reward points on my account, since they weren't properly applied after my previous purchases. I had all required info (i.e. Itinerary number, email confirmations) and all they had to do is to adjust my Reward points accordingly. To make a long story short, after 2 hours on the phone with 6 different reps and numerous repetitions of the same story I had to hang up.... I use Expedia for all my travel needs, but when it comes to customer service, they always disappoint. This unfortunately was not my first negative encounter with them.        	                1	2	Saturday	expedia	neutral
1783	            I reserved a room at LaQuinta Birmingham Cahaba Park South a couple of weeks ago through Expedia and paid in advance.  Expedia said my room was guaranteed for late arrival.  It was about 10:00pm and we were about 30 minutes from arriving at our hotel when my cellphone rang.  It was LaQuinta telling me that they overbooked and that they were giving my paid-for-in-advance room to somebody else.  They told me they were going to send me to another nearby LaQuinta at the same room rate I paid.  We got to that LaQuinta (Birmingham Homewood) and they were overbooked as well.  That LaQuinta was being renovated and all the finished rooms were gone.  The staff there told me they had a room that was almost done but it had no TV.  I agreed to that room as it was now almost 11:00pm.  We found that the A/C and the phone in that room did not work and some of the normal hotel room furniture was missing.  Long story short, I called Expedia to complain and was told by their Customer Service that when hotels overbook, the hotels are allowed to give out their rooms on a first-come-first-served basis.  This renders the Expedia guarantee worthless.  I'm going to do all my future bookings through actual hotel websites and avoid using Expedia from now on.        	                1	2	Thursday	expedia	negative
1784	            I tried booking a hotel stay and was using a promotion code through Expedia. I was unable to get the code to work online so I called the customer service number. The agent assured me if I booked the stay he would then transfer me to customer service and they would apply the discount. When after a very long wait spoke to them they refused to honor the discount saying they could not discount an existing reservation. I then told them to cancel my reservation and I would use another travel service, I was then told they could cancel the reservation but could not refund the amount already charged.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	neutral
1785	            So I needed a room last minute. I called Expedia and reserved s room that was in my price range. I get to the motel about 15-20 min later but had no reservation. So I ended up staying where I did the night before. The next day, I check my account and I saw a charge from Expedia (not the motel). I call Expedia and tell them the situation and ask for s refund. I've called 4x now. I'm actually writing this review while on hold. So far all I've been told was that the motel got my reservation 5 min after I left, yet no one, not the motel or Expedia notified me. This what Expedia told me; and that the motel held the room and kept the money and won't refund. But again, it was Expedia who charged my card according to my account info. I've been on hold now for an hour, waiting for a supervisor. My next step is to get my credit union involved due to unauthorized/ fraudulent charges.

1787	            I booked a hotel for 9 nights with Expedia and my credit card was charged $2500 almost immediately.  Later that day I saw the identical room on Booking.com for $300 less.  I called Expedia and was told I would have to fill out a price guarantee form online.  I did this and have never heard anything back in 10 days.  When I call to try and find out the status of my claim, I can never get to speak to anyone except in Sales.  They say they do not handle claims, but can not connect me with anyone that does.  They don't know any names or direct phone numbers for other departments.  The Expedia web site conveniently does not provide any contact information for direct Customer Service.  It is obvious all they want to do is get your money and then totally ignore you.  I dread to think what would happen if there is a critical problem while traveling that requires attention by a competent person.  I fully agree with the other negative reviews and do not intend to use this company again.        	                2	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
1788	            We booked a room 2 nights. It's nonrefundable. We decided not to go the first night. When we arrived the second night we had no room. It had been given away.  We were still charged and when I call they put me on hold and pass me around. When I did speak to someone they said they had to get in touch with the hotel to refund our $.  I said I paid you not the hotel. They said they would talk to hotel and get back with me in 2 days. Guess what? They never did. When I call they put me on hold and hang up...when I call back I have to tell the story all over. They put me on hold and eventually hang up.  I called a third time in 45 minutes they connected me to the hotel. I called expedia I expect to speak with someone there. Don't send me to the hotel and don't even tell me.  AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL customer service!!!  Once they have your money they could care less what happens when you get to your destination. It makes me want to hire an attorney.

I called to ask why my card still had not been charged for the accommodation I booked, she said bluntly 'because its a pay at hotel booking', in fact it isnt, when initially booking this hotel on expedia, it is a 'PAY NOW' hotel, in which i have provided the credit card details for, she then went to say ""call the hotel and find out for yourself', I made this booking with Expedia and not with the hotel directly, this is why I called expedia in the first place, and told her it is NOT my job to call the hotel, she then went to say ""its 2AM in rome and the hotel is closed' infact, the hotel have a 24hr front desk service in which she didn't bother to look or call, I ask her to speak to a supervisor as her attitude was disgusting and information she was providing me was false and not supportive to my enquire. She then went to say ""there are no supervisors on the floor, he doesnt start before 10AM', I have worked for similar call centres in my earlier years and I can assure you that a supervisor HAS to be on the floor at all hours of the day and night, its a legal requirement! False again, I asked her for a reference number to the call, she said expedia dont give call reference numbers, HOWEVER i called about 2 weeks ago about a another hotel and was kindly provided a reference number for that enquiry. I then asked for a manager and supervisor again, in whichshe actually got one this time. I just want to say that Customer Call Centres are meant to help people with their Expedia enquiries and NOT make it tougher! I have booked 4 hotels in the month of June with expedia and I can assure you that I wont be booking any more after that due to one person on the 'Care Team' that just didnt care!

1798	            I had the worst experience ever today with a customer service manager, and will be forced to dispute a charge on my account because of everything that resulted from my situation. I KNOW that I correctly inputted my hotel reservation details and was really careful about it. I made a reservation and did not notice the mistake immediately but after an hour passed and I re-checked my reservation EVERYTHING WAS WRONG!!! I called today to rectify a clearly obvious mistake that was made on the website and everyone refused to help me because of a policy that was in place. I understand the policy &amp; work with policies everyday as a Compliance Agent. I also come from a CS background and understand there are times when CS meets Compliance and depending on the situations, changes CAN be made to assist a customer. My situation is simple... I made a reservation to my liking but because I had multiple tabs open, SOMETHING went drastically wrong with my reservation. The date, the room type and the discount were wrong. Instead of helping me the CS Manager penalized me. He made me pay an additional night per policies because today is 4/29. My reservation was supposed to be for May 29th NOT April 29. The Room was for a King bed NOT 2 double beds. There was supposed to be a 10% discount, there was no discount. After arguing for almost an hour. I was charged a night stay for over 200 dollars to change my reservation date. This was sooo unfair. This company makes money by stealing from its customers who only need some assistance with special situation.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
1799	"            EXPEDIA REVIEW:So I purchased a flight through Expedia 2 weeks ago. The trip has then since been cancelled, so I called Expedia to see if I could get a refund and if not a refund, possibly a credit. The representative tells me that ""Yes, you can get a credit, we will apply this to your account right now in the amount of $198 for a future booking""I'm thinking, great! If I need a flight or hotel somewhere I can use this credit. I receive my credit receipt via email and to my surprise, I am told that when I redeem my ""credit"" of $198 for a future booking, I will be charged a penalty of $200..... uhh......So what is really happening here is I'm losing my entire purchase AND paying Expedia $2 for nothing.... ???WOW. To top it off, horrible customer service when I called back. The representative tells me ""Yes, that is accurate, you are in the negative with this purchase. We recommend that you shouldn't use your credit"".Why did we go through the process of a credit when really they should just say, you're out of luck and have lost the ticket. Thanks, Expedia.

I have all of the information needed to collect from these predatory scam artists. But, it would seem this company feels it is immune to the law. There is a lot of money to be made in a suit against Expedia, and I for one would be happy to assist in the dismemberment of this company.

1801	            If everything goes well, the company is good in finding lower prices. But when something goes bad, don't expect any help. Today I reserved a hotel room which had two types of rooms with 2 different rates. I chose the lower rate. After the reservation was complete, I noticed that they had applied the higher rate to my bill. I sent an email to the customer service the answer was that they can't help with cancellation and refund through email, asking to call them. I called and their staff checked the website and admitted that there was a bug in the system and the error happened again. But said that he can't refund me here! And that I needed to go to the website in best price guarantee and file there. I explained that I didn't find a lower price from another place, this is their website. He said the only thing he can do is to cancel the whole reservation altogether. After wasting 20 minutes of my time there I asked to connect me to his supervisor who introduced himself as Tyler. First it held me on the line for10 minutes just to connect me to him. Then the supervisor said he needs to check the site, although I explained that the other person had already checked the site. He put me on hold for 20 minutes and never showed up! And finally disappointed  I hung up the phone. So basically about 1 hour waste of time for nothing.I couldn't believe it. I was wondering if he was taking a nap while I was walking and waiting for him to answer. I should add that this bad customer service had happened before too.  It seems nowadays there are many companies that their growth has outpaced their training and customer service quality. This is very disappointing.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative
1802	"            The experience I have had booking our trip to New York has been a nightmare since the day I booked the trip in February.  I was trying to book a flight and hotel ""package"" for 4 women online.  One of the travelers wanted insurance and 3 didn't. I couldn't figure out if I could add the insurance for the one person, so I decided to call and ask.  I was told I could not purchase insurance for one person in group because it was a ""package"" and either all women would need to take the insurance or none.  I told the customer service gentleman, ""thanks and I will continue to book online"". I should have hung up right at that time, because, this is where all the trouble starts!  The gentleman told me if I booked over the phone he would be able to get me a ""better deal"".  The price he gave me over the phone was $100 less than what was listed online. I had decided to book my trip without the insurance and complete the booking over the phone. I gave my credit card number along with the required deposit.  The next morning I received an email summary of the trip and noticed the total package price was off by $200 and a second email stating I still owed $100 and this payment was overdue!  I just gave them $1800 the night before!Now is where I can relate to several others who have had similar complaints.  I must have spent at least 30 hours in total over several days trying to get my simple question answered about the overdue payment and why the price was off from what I was quoted the night before.  I would be on hold for 30+ min before I would even get on the line with someone, then put on hold to be transferred to a supervisor where I would be on hold for another 45-60 minutes only for my call to get disconnected during the transferring of the call.  Every time I would call in the automatic recording would ask me the same information, itinerary number, my phone number, etc.  No one would ever call me back after getting disconnected.  I would be on my landline also - so can't blame a ""dropped call""!!  At one point I told one of the customer service persons I would have to cancel my trip if I couldn't get my issues resolved.  Again getting know where, the next morning I had an email that my hotel portion of the trip was cancelled!  Remember this was a ""package"" so I am not sure how they could have cancelled part of the package.  Had to get back on the phone, after several hours again, and being told the supervisor had to listen in on the phone recordings, they admitted their mistake.  My hotel was rebooked; however, they told me because it was no longer a ""package"" I couldn't get insurance, and I said no problem, we never asked for insurance in the first place. The difference price was from the insurance which I never agreed to!  I received an email saying my trip was paid in full and I would not get charged anymore to my credit card.  Well, just a few days ago I received an email of URGENT matter that my account was not paid in full and changes were made to my trip without being paid in full.  Hummm, who made the changes - They did!  The balance of $196 was for the INSURANCE.  First of all I didn't ask for the insurance and secondly, I was told we couldn't have insurance for this trip because it wasn't a PACKAGE!!  More wasted hours on hold, getting disconnected (4 times within a 2 hour period), I finally just paid the $196 so I can go on the trip without any worries...After reading some of these other complaints, I am getting nervous again - will we have a seat on the flight and/or will we have a room??  NEVER, EVER again will I book through Expedia and neither should you!        "	                2	1	Sunday	expedia	negative

1805	"            I just got off the phone very frustrated. In a nutshell, I booked my trip back in January. I chose my seats on the plane. Expedia says the seats are not guaranteed. But since I booked my trip I got several CONFIRMED emails saying my seats are confirmed. So, today, 12 hours before my trip, I went to check in my flight and all of a sudden MY seat was moved and I was no longer sitting next to my boyfriend on the flight. I called Expedia right away but there was an hour and half wait. I noticed there were only a couple seats left so I panicked and called Delta. Delta's supervisor told me basically that Expedia only confirmed my boyfriend's seat and not mine. The only seats left were ""comfort"" seats for an extra $60 each! So I was forced to purchase these seats to guarantee my seats so we could sit together. After that, I called Expedia again to try to get credited back at least some of the money since their emails misled me thinking everything was confirmed and fine. I remind you, the emails from Expedia stated that I was going to be in the seats I originally requested and said in capital letters CONFIRMED. While this was going on (12 hours before my flight) an email came in from Expedia stating my seat request wasn't confirmed. So, while on the phone with Expedia, after talking to 3 people, finally got the higher up in charge, she was very rude with me from the beginning. NOT at all understanding or sympathetic to the fact that 12 hours before my flight I was being told I can not sit next to my boyfriend. All she did was repeat that they do not guarantee seats and that I will  not be credited for any money. She was nasty and not helpful at all. I will NEVER use them again. Neither will anyone I talk to, family and friends and all of the clients I get to tell this story to. Do NOT use Expedia unless you do not care if you sit with the other travelers on your trip! They give you a half days notice that what you requested wasn't fulfilled, meanwhile sending very misleading confirmation emails making you think everything is as expected.

They don't listen and put you on hold constantly. Horrible customer service and expedia should be ashamed. They don't understand the English language nor speak it fluently and they don't care either. I needed to change my return flight and they wouldn't help me. They were insisting they needed to charge me a 600.00 fee for change of flights for my 2 kids and I as they claimed it was an airline fee and that the money would go to the airline and not expedia. I would never recommend using expedia unless you want aggravation and enjoy being scammed.

1810	"            Be careful with Expedia - once they sell you a ticket, they can't do much if you have any problems ! If you try to talk to them with a problem - you will face corporate robots who only know how to repeat their default built-in phrases (from their corporate manuals). I personally bought 2 tickets for 4 friends of mine and I simply made the mistake to skip the travel protection for 1 of the 2 tickets. When I called later wanting to add it (to match my other friends' ticket) - all of their employees, from the agents to the managers, kept saying ""impossible"". They simply do not have the desire to help even their loyal clients (I've been using them for years). They could've called their 3rd party insurance provider and asked them for 1 exception. But they didn't. Instead their manager, Nicole, told me to google insurance companies and try to get an insurance from them. I asked if there's anyone, anyone, in their company who can simply add the travel protection, even the CEO. She said that there's no one who can do it. NO ONE. What a parody of a business :) As of now, I never had the ""pleasure"" of dealing with a flight cancellation and having to deal with this 3rd party booking website. Honestly, after today's experience, I hope I never will. If you need more info - you can call 907-799-4568.        "	                1	1	Friday	expedia	positive
1811	"            I have no way of providing my feedback directly to the company which I would love to do. However, I have spent well over 8-10 hours on the phone trying to resolve various issues. Most of which were started on Expedia's end. The representatives are all nice, but extremely unhelpful. They put you on hold to ""look into things"" without ever explaining why and coming back on the phone to ask questions they have already asked with no progress.  The phone gets disconnected several times and you never know if the representative will actually call you back or not. So then you are left to start all over again, or just pay for a flight you will never use. There is so much more I could document, but frankly I do not think it is worth my energy. The point is,  I will not be using expedia again for my travel needs. I would recommend using one of the 3 other sites reviewed on this website that all seem to have 4 out of 5 stars!

1812	            My wife and I wanted to visit Sarasota overnight, and to bring our dog, We searched for hotels/motels that accepted dogs and settled on Hyatt Place, which came up when we set pet-friendly as a selection criterion. We checked all the terms &amp; conditions and hotel policies, and the only reference to pets under hotel policies/pets was that we were limited to a small dog. We booked and paid a non refundable fare. Only when we received final confirmation - and could not cancel -  did we learn the hotel imposed a $75 charge for a dog. We were outraged and called the hotel, which confirmed this was a non-negotiable hotel policy. They advised us to take it up with Expedia. We spoke to three different people at Expedia call centres over two days to no avail. (The $75 surcharge is good even for a week, so it's not a rip-off if one stays long terms, but it's more than a 50% surcharge to the Expedia rate for a single night; even a baby as 3rd person costs only $10 more!) The $75 surcharge is mentioned under a section other than pet policies, which is not where you expect it to be. Very disappointing.        	                1	2	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1813	"            I just registered an trustpilot account, and spend my time to tell you guys my stories with booking with expedia.com. I used to book with expedia.com, orbitz.com a lot, since they are kind of intuitive and easy, but from now I will never book from an agent company, unless airline company doesn't sell ticket themself.    Around Oct 2013, I tried to change the return date of a international around trip flight ticket. I called expedia.com customer service, the rep helped me to check the price, it was over $900 to change the returning date, and it was almost the same price as my round trip ticket. The rep told me that's the price the airline charge on changing ticket date.  I trusted them since I always think it's not easy to make changes on flight tickets. But I still called the airline customer service(maybe ticketing department). A big surprise, airline rep told me the cost to change the returning date is only $70. Same flight, same date and time. That's more than $800 difference. Where does the difference go to?   After that I think it's maybe some miscommunications or policy difference between expedia.com and airlines. And I totally  affirm that expedia.com is scam my money after my second surprise.   I tried to book 2 airline tickets on expedia.com in Mar 2014, one adult and one 22 months old baby. As my experience, any child under 2 years old can book an on-lap ticket, which is usually less than 10% of the adult price. I then entered expedia.com, and filled all the information. At passenger information page, I put 22 months for the child age. And then click ""next"" button, an error message with red words came out ""on-lap ticket can only be booked by child with age under 2, please make changes then go to next step"". Tried a few times, still getting the errors. I then think this might be a website glitch. Then I called their customer service. And told the rep I'm getting the error when I book an on-lap ticket for a 22 months old child. After a few minutes waiting for the rep to check on her side. She told me that because the child is already almost 2 year old, and they can not let her sit on the lap, she must have a special seat some like that. And the price is $1200 something as the price for an adult is around $1400. I argued a little bit with her, but she was just repeating the same thing with a hesitating tone.   After hang up the phone, I think this might be the recent adjustment on airline policy. But I still want to try to call airline directly to confirm this. Then I did, another big surprise. The rep from airline helped my booked the tickets with no problem, child under 2 year old still charge less than 10% of the adult price. Which was $90. The adult price I got was about $80 cheaper than expedia.com too.  Double wins.   I don't know other companies do the same like expedia.com or just expedia.com. But I think expedia.com is very untrustable and scamming my money with their nonsense reasons. Hope this will help. Sorry for my bad English.        "	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	positive

I think this says it all.------------Dear SirsI have been writing to you since February to try and obtain a refund for two flights and two hire cars. Whilst you have now refunded the cost of the flights, if you take the trouble to read through the numerous emails which I have sent, you will see that you have not bothered to respond to my requests for a refund for the hire cars. This refund was agreed verbally by a member of your team several weeks ago but has still not been actioned. I am reluctant to telephone you again as I have already incurred massive costs in trying to resolve this problem by telephone with Expedia with no satisfactory outcome.Can you please give this matter your urgent attention and issue my refund immediately. This situation is beyond ridiculous and is the worst example of customer service I have ever encountered.-----------I would not advise anybody to use this company. Although, when things works as they should they are fine, when things go wrong you really are up against it.

1816	            We booked a flight for our son and his return flight was cancelled by e mail a day prior .( He was simply kicked off the passenger list but the flight was still going). I called and had a person on the phone who I could barely understand because of the heavy accent. This person was trying to help me and contacted the airline help desk and after 45 min. on the phone just told me to call the airline myself. Well that was not what the airline told her to do. They gave her options but she never gave me the options. The next expedia agent had a very heavy accent also, again which was very hard to understand.  Then I spoke with the supervisor after 30 min.  She told me that she would call me back or send an e- mail. Well , that never happened. The third expedia agent finally rebooked the flight which took 1.5 hrs. to do and then I got the wrong confirmation number we needed at the airport. The flight was then overbooked. Really? So, all in all I spend 3.5 hrs. on the phone, most of that time was spent waiting. This was the last time booking through expedia.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	positive

The agent I spoke to couldn't understand me nor I him and a very long frustrating call followed.  As he was redoing my booking he mentioned the wrong date for my return journey and I corrected him, but despite this he booked the wrong date.  When I called to correct this I had to pay a further £104 to change the date.  I complained to customer service and they replied that they couldn't find my booking and I should take this up with my travel agent.  I booked with Expedia alone not any other travel agent. I have replied with all my booking details but have had no further response.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative
1819	"            This will be somewhat long but if anyone reading this is going to use it to base their decision to book with Expedia please be patient.The first thing I want to say is that I'm someone who travels a fair amount of time. I consider that taking at least 3 trips a year through flight to both domestic and international locations. I've been doing this since 2010. I have booked all of my flights through Expedia. The reason for this is because I find their website to be very easy to navigate and great prices. I have to commend them on having an amazing website with a very easy interface. One would think that with such a great website that their human interaction is just as good. I want to say this without any exaggeration at all, as I know many people exaggerate when writing reviews. Expedia has THEE WORST customer service out of any company I have ever dealt with.That of course is a personal opinion but let me give some personal background. I've work in customer service for several years and as a professional, trained, created, and ran an entire customer service department for a call center on two different fronts. Both internally as well as outsourced. I felt I did that with at an extremely high level so when I deal with other customer service departments for other businesses I give them the benefit of the doubt and try to make their jobs as easy as possible since I know the ins and outs of the business. The sad thing is with Expedia, I truly believe that 90% of the agents are either incompetent, which I know can be awfully mean to say, or they have 5 minutes of training and then are expected to handle live customers. I've had 3 absolutely awful experiences where on the 3rd I had a friend of mine on 3-way just to witness how bad they are so we could laugh after. The #1 question anyone could ask is ""If they're that bad why continue to book through them?"" Fair question so here are the answers.#1. I don't need to rely on their customer service to complete my bookings. If I've taken 20 trips I've probably spoken to their customer service 4 times.#2. As I mentioned before the website and prices are excellent.#3. I'm a huge fan of rewards points and I earned several through my years of booking with them.After this last interaction I'm going to redeem my rewards points and never booking with them again. So let's get to it.I'm going to Israel for Good Friday to have an amazing religious experience. In doing that, I wanted to book a tour that takes me through Jerusalem and Bethlehem. There are several that Expedia offers and the one in particular I wanted to book says it's going to one of the sites I really want to go to, the Wailing Wall. The thing is, the main description says that's one of the sites you get to go to but in the detailed description it says you only see it from a distance. So my one and only question for Expedia is do I actually get to go to the Wailing Wall or do I see it from a distance. I call Expedia and it literally takes about 3 minutes to speak to someone. I tell them the tour I want and then my question. The person I speak with tells me that they need to transfer me to customer service. Ok fine. I'm then transferred and have to wait 20 minutes to speak to someone. Finally I get someone. She says her name and asks me for my name and how she can help me. I tell her and then out comes the question.Me: I'm trying to book a tour and had a question about it. Can I give you the name of the tour so you can look it up?Representative: Yes Sir. That's fine.Me: It's the Full Day Tour to Jerusalem and Bethlehem. It says in the description that I go to the Wailing Wall but it also says I just view it from a distance.Representative: Ummm, can you hold on for a second sir...............................(about 1 minute and a half passes)..............Is this the Rome tour?Me: I""m sorry?Representative: Is this the Rome tour sir?Me: Did you say Rome?Representative: Yes sir.Me: No. I said Jerusalem and Bethlehem. This is a tour in Israel. It's called the Full Day Tour to Jerusalem and Bethlehem.Representative: Oh ok. I'm sorry about that. Hold on one moment.I hear her typing and then reading very silently. This let's me know she's simply looking at the website. She has the same exact access I have. I could literally help her with her next customer if they had a question the same way she's helping me. I'm on hold for about 3 minutes.Representative: Ok Sir, is this the Full Day Rome tour with entrance to the Colisseum??Me:..........................................................................................................................................................Ma'am. Can you please get me someone who can help me. I've been on the phone for 40 minutes.Representative: I see 13 on my phone.Me: Ma'am, I've been on the phone for 40 minutes. Maybe it's just been 13 with you but it's been a total of 40. Representative: Oh. Because I see 13. Hold on please and let me transfer you to someone who can help you.Me: (Click)I got off the phone with a slight headache.        "	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive

Today, 5 days before the trip, I again check and again find that there are no seats assigned (and none available). Expedia claims they will be assigned at the gate (whatever might be left). According to American Airlines, they have no record of Expedia ever having contacted them about seat assignments and we are stuck!

1827	            In Feb 2014, contacted Expedia to cancel two flights. Operator explained no refund, Expedia will hold the $1400,  (two tickets at $700 each)  there will be a $200 penalty per ticket when booking new flight, plus the difference between the cost of the old fair and the cost of the new fair .In Mar 2014, rebooked one new flight. Operator 1 confirmed the $1,400 balance was to be divided equally, $700 being held, new fair $900. Calculation 200 penalty + 196.26 difference between old and new fair, giving a total of $396, agreed to pay new ticket price, took my cell number to call back if disconnected, then transferred to Operator 2 (explained everything again) but disconnected after 1hour 12 minutes.Called back. Operator 3 (explained everything again) evasive and transferred to Operator 4 (explained everything again) who claimed there was only 256 in credit not 700, and the new price was now $860. Informed him of his error, price was $396 as per Operator 1, however Operator 4 kept with new ticket price. Asked Operator 4 where the money went, explaining I can buy a new fair for $900 online (visited Kayak and Delta while put on hold) without using Expedia. After making a number of attempts to obtain an explanation (English is clearly not Expedia operators first Language) Operator 4 clarified my choices - take the fair or don't take the fair. Asked to speak with manager , but was warned by Operator 4 the manager will say the same thing.Manager (explained everything again) confirmed only $250 left in account, could not explain where it went. Agreed to investigate initial conversation with Operator 1, to confirm $700 in account (half the original $1,400) and that I was in fact quoted $396, but that would take 72 hours - which is 48 hours later than I needed to book the flight. I then realized I would have to go through all this @$%$%.... again when booking the second ticket in April.Explained to the manager I have spent over $50,000 in five years with Expedia, $10,000 in the last six months, and that in a short period Expedia lied to me - they did not call back, Expedia hung up on me, Expedia stole money- $1,400 reduced to $490 in 90 min, was disrespected by Operator 4, my integrity was challenged by the manager - he will check recorded messages, and like an epiphany realized that after 2 hours 30 minutes discussing it was a lost cause. Informed the manager to keep the $1,400, Expedia need it more than me, its worth it not dealing with Expedia.Went online booked new tickets with Delta.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	positive

They then said they wouldn't credit us towards another room for our stay and further more said that they couldn't give us a refund because the original hotel had the money.  They said 3 different times (even getting off the phone as if they were calling) that they had spoke with the hotel and the hotel wouldn't give us a refund.  We then went down to the hotel and they said that no one from Expedia had called and further more they couldn't give us back the money because they don't even have our card information rather they are paid by Expedia and they weren't holding any money.

1829	            I have been trying for over 3 weeks to change one of my flights booked though Expedia. I know the change I need to make and the alternative flight that I want, all I need is someone to make the change which should take a matter of minutes. I phone the customer service line and get put on hold for for so long I cannot take it anymore. I finally got through to someone last week in their Indian call centre. The line was terrible I could barely hear what he was saying which didn't really matter because he could barely speak English. He then put me on hold again and 30 minutes later I gave up waiting as he clearly couldn't be bothered to come back and help me.I have tried again and again to phone their help line and no-one answers. In the mean time the flight I want is getting more and more expensive and soon it will be fully booked and my holiday ruined. My options are to continue phoning this helpline which is costing me a fortune in phone bills or cancel the flight I already have booked (losing the money I spent on it) and rebook through the airline direct. The airline won't change the flight I have because I booked through the awful Expedia website. This is the first time I have used Expedia and I will NEVER use them again. Their customer service just spits in your face.Please please please do not take the risk of using Expedia. They will rip you off, take your money and run.Update 1 April 2014: Yes it is April fools day and like a fool I again tried phoning the Expedia helpline. The recorded message said I had a 3 minute waiting time. After 5 minutes the line went dead!!! I phoned back straight away and finally got through to someone. He said he would phone the airline and put me on hold AGAIN! Just like last time I waited and waited and suddenly the phone went dead again!! I am now so desperate and fatigued I do not know what to do. I tried to phone the airline and beg for help but they refused saying because I booked though Expedia they will not help me or offer any advice.The only way I can describe Expedia is a disgusting, criminal company. If you book through them you are taking a massive risk. It is not a risk worth taking. I cannot stress enough that you should NEVER use these 3rd party websites. This is the first time I have used one and I regret it. My bank balance also regrets it as it will cost me £400 to rebook the flight through the airline and it has already cost me nearly £30 in phone calls.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

I was told by him that I would have to make my purchase and then he would transfer me to another line where they would refund me the $25, deducting from my purchase...and then provide me with a $25 dollar coupon for the future, due to the inconvenience. Once i was transferred i was told they could not do that, it is not their policy and that they could only provide me with Expedia Points, so i was transferred to the Hotel Management line where they were no help as well.I was told that they could not deduct the 25 from my order, as it was already purchased and that they could not provide me with a $25 dollar coupon for the future so i spoke to a supervisor, after being on hold for 25 minutes, and when i explained my situation he refunded me $25 from my purchase and ignored me when I told him that i was also supposed to receive a $25 dollar coupon for the future, his response was ""have a good day"" Unprofessional, i was told 3 different policies, get your stories straight don't tell someone false information.

Naturally, we call expedia and explain to them the situation and hope that they could understand the situation and admit to their fault, and book us the next flight out. Instead they tell us it is our fault and that we have to pay another $250 per person (family trip of 5) in order to book the next flight to Atlanta. We received no help and it felt like they intentionally do these tricks just so that people will pay more money. It was a rip off, I have never been treated so rudely with customer service, constantly telling me it was my fault...but why would the itinerary even say 7:00 am, when apparently their Atlanta flight always leaves at 6:00 am.

Expedia ""Customer Service"" requires you to leave a number where you can be called back, ""so you won't be inconvenienced on hold.""  IF they call you back, THEN you're on hold.  And if your cell phone is dead or you're out of range, well then you can... Hmmm.  Oh, I know, go back to the website and sign up for an account!  Nope, that doesn't work either.  Because when you made the reservation you didn't have an account.  You're stuck with the reservation you made. Because we ain't got no customer service.PS:  It's two hours later.  I finally talked to ""Henry"" who took 15 minutes to move my hotel reservation ahead 1 day.  Now it's three hours later, and both the hotel and Expedia websites are still showing the original rate for the room.  But Henry bumped me up $17.  Whatever.  Just let me put this behind me.PPS:  On arrival at the hotel I discovered the date change that was so difficult to make and cost $17, was not in fact made!  Fortunately there was a room.

The phone agent was nice, but I couldn't help feeling sorry for her having to catch flak for this company.I repeatedly tried to contact Expedia over concerns about possible compromise of my account security, but couldn't get through their phone tree, which kept asking for an itinerary number, which I didn't have because I was not asking about a booking. In the course of my correspondence with their robo-help system, I was sent a response written for a completely different customer. Finally, when I tried to cancel my account online, the response was ""no access to that functionality."" I finally faked my way through the phone tree with a fake itinerary number, asked to have my account canceled, and was told it would take 72 hours for that request to go through.Avoid this company.

1838	            I fly often and have never needed to have a visa for a transit 2hr stop. Apparently with my nationality if i am flying to anywhere to Europe and transit in Heathrow, I require a visa to London. I was shocked to find this out when I was refused the right to travel at the airport. This was mentioned NOWHERE before or during the purchase of the ticket. London heathrow is the only airport in the world that requires transit visas for SOME destinations only. I have flown transit through there to the USA and required no visa. How was I supposed to know that things were different if you are doing a transit before flying to Madrid. I called expedia and asked them why there was no note of this made, as it is very easy to give a warning about this. They simply said that their job is providing the ticket and not explaining about how it can or cannot be used. i had to call 4 times, min 30 min spent on each phonecall, every time getting no help whatsoever. $500 on their balance sheet is nothing, but it is 2 weeks worth of busting my arse off at the office and i cannot simply let it go and not complain when the company that claims to be the best travel site in the world sell me a product that i potentially might not be able to use!! What they did is equivalent to selling a TV to a blind man! Had they refunded me/ given me an upgrade on my next ticket/ made it up to me in any way they would have lost 0.000000000001% of their revenue and gained a customer for life....unfortunately and I feel comfortable saying this, they are idiots when it come to customer service. Things went from we cant help you...but please help me, its not my fault that i couldnt use the ticket, I am sure this happened before you should have put a warning...to ok we will contact british airways but they will reject the refund, to comeon please help me out here...to no sorry its not our problem...to yes it is your problem because you took my money and gave me no value whatsoever...to no it is not our problem...to yes it is your problem because i will call daily and pester you about this and will post once online about your incompetence...to sorry still cant do anything...to i will not get off this phone call until you treat me fairly.. to we are treating you fairly..to not in my opinion reimburse me or i will get my lawyer to make a big deal out of this that you can avoid with a little reimbursement. In the end they agreed to give me a $200 voucher for hotels/packages....doesn't even cover the hotel booking i lost...let alone the stress they put me through and the ticket price.

I called expedia (which took awhile to get a live person) and told me their price match guarantee was only good for 24 hours after I booked my flight.  So because it is 9 days later, I am too late to get the better price.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told it would be at least 15 minutes before one could become available.  So I got a $60 dollar lesson to use Orbitz from now on.  Not only do they price match, but they do it automatically.  And they even give you ""Or bucks"" to use toward future books.

If their program couldn't even search a hotel by zip code, I don't know what else can they do... I switched to other travel site right away.

That said my trip is not for two more weeks and we found a better deal elsewhere.  I understand hotels will put an amount on ""hold"", but they don't usually charge you until you've checked out.  When he cancelled the reservation, no one told him that if you cancel with Expedia they charge you a one night stay anyway.  But they didn't even do that, they charged him for 2 nights $483 dollars later..  In their defense, they ""claim"" we will be reimbursed which remains to be seen.

Unless it is something small calling them is useless.I was within a day of my flight to Manila that I had paid almost 4 months ago but since expedia couldn't get much help from Eastern China to fix my ticket issues Expedia paid near 7k to get me new tickets for my flight.This is really the first time I ran into such troubles using expedia and it wasn't really it appeared their fault but the airline but they stepped up to the plate big time to help salvage my vacation.        	                1	5	Saturday	expedia	neutral

We also purchase the insurance/waiver. My husband had an unexpected problem that he had to attend to at work and now this company says I have to pay them $200 per change fee even though it will be refunded to me the same day PLUS $400 extra for our hotel. They blamed it on the hotel and said they had nothing to do with the increase in price. Yet, I checked the hotel myself and actually the date we were moving it to was CHEAPER than the price we purchased the ticket for. They are crooks and we will NEVER book with them again.

Do I call anyone in Vegas?  NOTHING...  I called them to tell them the mistake I had made and asked if they would still honor the tickets.  Most companies would do this for an honest mistake.

1848	"            Overall I am extremely dissatisfied with Expedia and their entire ""customer service"" department.  The initial issue was my flights got changed because American Airlines switched a flight time... that's fine, but to get my flight path fixed was a nightmare! The 1st (of 10) service reps said he had to talk to the airline and would get back to me... well he never did.  2nd call: this guy seemed very helpful and said he could do it all on the phone with me right there, which he did.  Except then I got my new itinerary and it was completely missing a flight!  Do you expect me to walk from one city to the next?  The next call was over 2 hours as the Expedia rep then the supervisor then the manager and even Expedia Legal all realized that it was completely their stupid fault for messing up my itinerary.  And yes they tried to pin it on me the entire time, even though if you even glance at the itinerary it was a blatant error on the part of Expedia!  After an extremely long and painful process of them coming to the realization it was completely their fault, they finally corrected the problem by paying for a new separate flight on a second itinerary.  Supposedly all was finally fixed.  Then when I go to check in, the airlines look at my horrendous flight path and notes and their system rejects it.  2 hours later on the phone with US Airways (they covered the first route) they cleaned it up so that it would make sense, but then they came to the roadblock that Expedia had to approve and put it in Sync... well that took another hours to get through to a rep then another hour to get to a manager and then another hour on the phone with no response.  Finally they said they would call me back... yeah right, just like the last guy!  No call back.  (MY FLIGHT IS TOMORROW!)  So finally I call in again and the last rep call directly over to US Airways and tells me to just go early and it should be good to go and finalize at the airport.All in all I am somewhere between 8-10 hours completely wasted on something that should have only take 30 minutes at most.  I would like to know where to send in the bill/invoice for all the wasted hours I put into this.  I bill my clients a bare minimum of $27.5 so I would like my check for $275 if you would ever like to see me using your pitiful service again!        "	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
1849	            We booked our hotels in USA through Expedia. This just meant that when we wanted to change our reservation, we HAD to do it through Expedia. BUT the Danish Expedia web side was down and you could not call them up because of the time difference. The Danish Expedia and the other countries’ Expedia do not communicate, so there were no possible ways to change our reservation at the correct time. Other than that their system also sucks. When you book a hotel, you get an email from Expedia showing the dates and such, but to get your reservation number you have to view a travel plan on their own web side.Do not use this when traveling abroad!        	                7	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

1853	"            Stay away from Expedia!! I called customer service to ask a simple question about my recent purchase. Apparently, there are 2-3 tiers you have to go through just to speak to a supervisor. While attempting to speak to someone to answer an infantile question; I was disconnected 3-4 times after waiting 30 minutes each call.  In the course of two days I have been on the phone with Expedia for (7) hours. Meanwhile, their calls are all outsourced and it is extremely difficult to understand the vernacular of any one person affiliated with Expedia. Before officially booking my trip I had spoken with a Customer service rep who was forcefully trying to have me purchase my trips through her, and telling me that the prices were only going to increase from that point. I booked the trip 10 minutes later for a cheaper price. To my astonishment, I randomly saw that the price for my trip decreased $150 per person. Moreover, I booked over 7 separate itineraries, and spent between $4,500-$5,000. I called today to have a supervisor adjust the price of each itinerary, bc after all their website does say ""best price guaranteed ""! Once again I waited on the phone for an hour, then Audrie, the rep, said that she was transferring me to her supervisor. Unbelievably, I was transferred back to tier one to wait through the process again! After speaking to over 10 different reps in the last week I have found that these reps appear to be trained to lie and deceive. Nothing about Expedia is honest or easy. The saying ""you get what you pay for"" pertains exactly to the dishonest business.I will make certain that every review site knows about the scandalous business of this company. I'm a manager of a wellness company and this is not the way you do business! I will make certain that my sister who is in the entertainment business ( who has well over 15,000 followers at the moment)posts on all of her social media sites about this retched business.

The website kept telling me it couldn't book it, so I needed to call the customer service line.  After spending 2 hours on hold, I finally got through to someone.  My package deal was $2,090 when I was booking online.  By the time I got through to the lady, it had gone up to $2,440.  She told me that they couldn't honor the price on my screen since I hadn't booked before it went up.  The only reason I HADN'T booked was because the website was glitching and wouldn't let me.  After her going back and forth with me for 15 minutes about how she couldn't honor the price, I asked for a manager.  She kept telling me that I couldn't talk to one until I insisted about 6 times.  Finally she said I still couldn't talk to one but that she would honor the price.   She was going through the booking process of getting me on the flights and told me she was going to put me on hold.  After 10 minutes of being on hold, I was transferred to another person completely!  That person said they couldn't transfer me back to the original person and I had to re-explain my situation with them.  They refused to honor the price and this time the flight had gone up another $16!  By this point I had been on the phone for 3 hours and 40 minutes.  I eventually agreed to pay the higher price, so we were going through the book process and then the lady told me that none of my flights worked together.  And I asked her to explain, and she said that I just needed to pick new flights completely!  She said I wouldn't be able to make any of the planes between my layovers.  My layovers were between 2-4 hours and they were in SMALL airports.  It would not have been a problem.  I've flown several hundred times and have rarely had problems with making connecting flights.  So I told them that they had horrible customer service and that I would go somewhere else.  Completely ridiculous.  Not helpful at all!  Oh!  And they charged my credit card 10 times!

I booked a flight through American Airlines and had excellent caring, compassionate customer service, not so for my husband.  When my husband went to book his flight the American website was down, so since the flight costs were comparable through Expedia he booked his flight through them.  NEVER AGAIN.My Dad's last days extended longer than anticipated. It was a deeply stressful and emotional time.  My husband had to change his flight.  He had paid over $800 for this ticket.  He began a three hour process of dealing with Expedia to make the change.After being on hold for a lengthy time, he was finally answered by a series of inept phone personnel.  He remained calm and professional.  He asked for the change, they told him it would be an additional $200, he said fine, they put him on hold for over 20 minutes then the call timed out and disconnected.  This happened to him 6 times!  If he asked for a supervisor, the same thing happened.  This was a $1000 transaction and they could not make it happen.  Finally after 3 hours they told him his flight was cancelled for his Monday flight and booked for Tuesday.Monday morning, the day of the funeral, he receives a notice that ""American Airlines has cancelled your flight"" that is all.  So he began the process again with Expedia, the same cycle happened for an additional hour and a half, with repeated assurance that he would not be cut off and/or a supervisor would call him back if it did happen.  They never did.  I was losing it, he remained calm.  He was a pallbearer so we had to get going.  He finally just called American Airlines again (They had earlier told him they could not make the change as Expedia was the broker) They took compassion on him and made the change so he was able to fly out on Tuesday.  No one should be treated this way regardless of the situation.WE WILL NEVER USE EXPEDIA AGAIN and will tell anyone who will listen about this horrible company.

1860	            I recently purchased an airline ticket through EXPEDIA.  I have to say that it was an absolute disaster and I found their support after the sale to be the worst customer service that I have ever experienced from any company.My wife called to change out original flight, since there was an impending storm on the East Coast.  The customer service representative that she spoke to seemed to have a hard time understanding what we wanted to do.  Finally, she agreed to change the flights since the airlines that we were flying on were offering to change flights due to the weather.  However, somewhere in the system the change was never finalized.  We arrived at Logan airport early on the morning of our flight, only to find that we didn't have a ticket on the airline.  (They showed us the reservation, but no accompanying ticket.)  We spent the entire day at Logan attempting to resolve our problem.  We called Expedia's customer service line dozens of times, but the wait time was 3 HOURS!!!!!!!!!  When we finally got a call back, the agent put us on hold and then we were disconnected.  We were stranded at the airport with absolutely no support.  EXPEDIA NEEDS TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY HOTLINE THAT CUSTOMERS CAN CALL FOR IMMEDIATE HELP!  We weren't flying out for a vacation, we were flying to attend my father-in-law's memorial service.Overall, because we bought through your service, no airline felt obligated to help us.  We finally convinced American Airlines to refund our ticket after we shed many tears at their customer service desk.

1862	            A year ago I would have told you Expedia was an excellent and dependable company. In the past three months, my opinion has completly changed. The only reason to book flights through Expedia instead of the airline was their best price guarantee. You could call and learn in 30 minutes if it was honored, which is was if the flights were the same. Now they don't honor prices if it isn't the same fare rate (they may both be economy but one is an E and the other a W) which makes it impossible because that is the whole reason for price differences. And you need to take time to email the request only to recieve an email in 72 hourse, which means you have lost the ability to cancel and get the better fare. You cannot find a phone number on the site; they will only call you back after you search for their contact us info. Their call centers are overseas so that if you do talk to someone, it is difficult to understand them. CS reps are pleasant but ineffective, they hide behind their inablity to help you. The web site went down last night as I submitted a purchase. There was a phone # on the trouble screen but there was a 1 hour 45 minute wait.To see if purchase had gone through,  I waited an hour before I gave up. Today I called to see if the purchase had gone through. CS saw it on my account but it didn't go through and they would not honor the rate. Something is very wrong with the mangagement practices this year. It is not worth the aggravation and there is no benefit to using them rather than booking through the airline.        	                3	2	Sunday	expedia	neutral
1863	            I booked a flight with Delta through Expedia.  Delta of course cancelled on of the flights. We were rebooked on another flight that was unsatisfactory. When Expedia sent me the notice, I said the selection was unsatisfactory and expedia's website stated a customer service rep would contact me in 24 hours.  Never happened.  When I called Expedia, my experience was as pitiful as many of the other comments I've read. After waiting 27 minutes, the first rep hung up on me. The next rep was completely confused by my request even though I found a return flight that was acceptable.  She put me on hold at least three times then transferred me to someone else.  The entire saga had to be retold.  I was told the wait time to talk to Delta was very long, so they would call me back. No return call; however, I received an email that the flight was rebooked-on the WRONG day!!  So, I tried to call them again that evening and max wait time was 12 minutes.  37 minutes later- no rep. Called on my home phone simultaneously and would likely still be on hold on both lines but I  decided to call Delta. After a brief phone call with delta, problem was fixed without any drama.  Difficult to know what the issue is with Expedia; I guess I feel some relief knowing I'm not the only person disgusted with their incompetence.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative

Due to the storm in Atlanta our flight was cancelled until the second day of reservations.   I contacted Expedia to let them know we could not check in until Friday due to storms. We could not find a number for our hotel and they would not give us one.  I wanted to make sure they did not give our room away for the second night because of our late check in. Expedia outsources to India and there is DEF. a language barrier After being put on hold numerous times for up to 20 minutes I was told in broken English that on top f my prepaid rooms I would be charged $159.00 for my late check in.....why did they want to do this? Because ""prices have changed"" on a room already paid for two months previous. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was put on hold AGAIN for 20 minutes. I never spoke to a supervisor. Took our chances and did get our reserved room and have contacted our credit card company, complained to the BBB.   Lesson learned. NEVER deal with this company. I will tell everyone I know, and everyone who will listen how horrible this company is. Wish I'd of found this review page before wasting my time and money.

1866	            I used the cancel flight option, paid for it, and was unable to make the trip. I cancelled and was credited $241.00 for my flight (the hotel was credited back to my charge card).  Was told I had 6 months to book a new flight, which I tried 6 weeks later....first call, on hold 25 minutes before I got someone, then told I had wrong department. Second call, I opted for the return call, another 20 minute wait, but they did call back. They couldn't find my return flight, which I had pulled up on my screen and was ready to pay and book, just needed to know how to apply my credit. While I was waiting my reservation went up by $31.00! I told him, book it before the price changes! That guy left me on hold for over 30 minutes and I finally hung up. I made new reservations and found an airfare a little less than my first itinerary, called back and explained to the girl to just check in with me, which she did, thankfully, but also said she couldn't find my return flight info. After another 40 minutes of her saying she's still waiting for an agent, she finally said she would transfer me...while I was on the phone with her, another call came in, which I didn't take and it turns out that was the supervisor calling me...she still hasn't called back. I booked my trip at full fare and will NEVER use Expedia again! VERY bad business practice to make it so difficult and annoying to get your credit you have to hang up. I spent over 3 hours on this...Not how I wanted to spend my Saturday afternoon. If they had less than 1 star I would have used that option.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

She put me on hold while she located a supervisor.·         Supervisor came on and I had to explain everything again.

1868	"            I booked 2 tickets to a Tang Dynasty dinner and show during a recent holiday to Xi'an, China. As the day grew closer I became concerned that no cantact had been made for our hotel pickup, and there was no answer from the phone number provided. I tried calling Expedia, was put on hold and then transferred to an overseas call centre, draining all the credit on my Chinese pre-paid phone in the process. No response.On returning to Australia I have called Expedia no less than 4 times, the first three times I was told I would receive my refund in 5-15 days, but nothing happened. I have been put on hold for lengthy periods to an Indian call centre (at my expense, of course); yesterday's call to India went on for 48 minutes, and I am still no closer to getting my $208.00 refund.I didn't think things could get any worse, but the email I received today from Expedia takes the cake:""Thank you for contacting Expedia.com.au regarding refund of the activity booked.I apologise for the inconvenience caused.Your words carry a lot of weight with us, and I am concerned to hear that your experience with Expedia is not to your satisfaction.I surely value your feedback and completely understand that apologies would not solve the purpose however, on our end Expedia will make sure that this does not happen again.I have tried contacting the vendor however, they are not picking up the call due to non-business hours.

And if you want to express your concern or actually talk to someone about customer service --welll good luck! Even the people on the phone don't know how to get you to talk to someone who actually cares.

1871	            This business (Expedia) has horrible ratings. I couldn't agree more. I wish I knew that before I bought anything through them. The guy on the phone for CS was hard to understand since he was from another country. He couldn't answer any of my simple questions. I asked if I could receive points for my latest booking and he said I could not and he couldn't tell me why due to confidentiality. Which made no sense and he couldn't even explain why. He offered me a 25$ coupon for next time booking. I asked why I received that and all he could say it was from an agent's error but he refused to pull up the paperwork/file to give me info on it.

1872	            I booked my honeymoon trip here to BORA BORA.  I specifically told the lady I wanted to stay over the water villas. She booked me a garden view room. Hadn't I carefully reviewed the itinerary sent to my email. I would have never known. Then she misspelled my middle initial so another agent had to call me and rebook me another flight cuz they couldn't  change it. Then when I went to cancel the flight because I was extremely upset they cancelled it but did not cancel the flight they rebooked. Finally after being on the phone with them for hours and agents leaving me on hold and hanging up on me. They granted me the refund but they deducted $150, which I feel expedia should've covered that because it was there mistake when I told them to cancel everything.... Then I realized a lot of discrepancies on my online credit card statement so I called them and they stated they would refund me the money but never did so I just called my credit card company and disputed the charges. I'm soooo done with expedia. They completely disappointed me especially because I usually book my trips here but this takes the cake. They left me with a nasty taste in my mouth and I will boycott this travel agency for the rest of my life and I have told all my friends and family of my horrible experience so they will do the same as well.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

1874	"            We booked flights and 1 night hotel accommodation online. We wanted to change that 1 night hotel accommodation to another night (the next night) as the hotel booking had no booking change fees attached to the Expedia booking. I spent about 30 minutes with one agent yesterday morning (FEB-17-2014) who couldn't figure out how to make this change and kept putting me on hold until eventually the call was cut off. I called later in the day to try my luck again and ended up with an abrupt agent who wasn't friendly either and wanted to change the hotel booking to a pre-paid non-refundable booking and refund us just over $20. My wife had the same package [live quote] open on a separate computer screen and it should have been closer to $50 difference and the hotel should have remained with a flexible cancellation policy. We felt the agent was trying it on by imposing a ""hidden"" change fee, as well as wanted to make the whole booking non-refundable (not just the flights). We ended up leaving the night ""as-is"" and booked through an alternate channel as we were concerned the Expedia agents would mess up our bookings altogether. As a travel agency owner, I am simply astonished by how a relatively simple change (within 24 hours of making the reservation) could cause such confusion and incur additional ""hidden"" costs even though the cancellation policy clearly stated there would be no change fees for the hotel. Very disappointing experience and a waste of time for nothing. We feel we are close to $50 out due to a lack of agent training.Be warned, any changes to your reservation (even within 24 hours of making the reservation) are an absolute nightmare and don't trust the ""no cancellation fees"" - they always find a way by making it incredible difficult to change or rebook.

1877	            We arrived at 8 pm at our hotel in Miami to find that our reservation had been canceled by Expedia that afternoon without any notice to us. The reason was that the credit card used to guarantee the stay had been canceled a couple of weeks before due to fraudulent use. I suppose I can understand this cancellation, but to do it without notice or giving us a chance to provide a valid card in its place was infuriating. The hotel was fully booked by then, as were most others nearby. We eventually did get a room - but at the rack rate which was well over $300 for the night - almost twice the price for the Expedia-booked room. The whole experience was scary, inconvenient and expensive.  There are many alternatives for Expedia these days; hopefully the alternatives will show better customer service and concern.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	neutral
1878	"            After a horrible experience with both the Expedia site (website malfunction) and customer service, I decided to cancel the reservation. I was within the first 24 hours, so according to Expedia Policy I was able to cancel with no fees. The customer service rep confirmed this, and then confirmed the refund amount, which was explained would be credited in two amounts (one for hotel, one for flight). Total Refund: $2,312.52Refund Pt. 1:$1,282.20Refund Pt. 2: $1,030.32Thinking everything was resolved, I later received an odd voice mail from Expedia. The woman on the phone said they were sorry they couldn't get in touch with me, and she was calling about my refund amount. Then, without providing any instructions about if I need to call back and without leaving a call back number, she hung up. So, I checked my credit card statement, and I noticed that my refund was incorrect. I received two refund amounts: $1,182.20 &amp; $1,030.32. Anyone with any basic concept of addition and subtraction could figure out that $1,182.20 + $1,030.32 does NOT equal $2,312.52. So, I checked my emails again, and sure enough the confirmation email for my cancellation indicated the incorrect amount. Back to the customer service line. The woman I spoke to was nice enough, but after explaining my issue, she kept repeating that ""the refund has been processed"". Ok. Yes. I know. It took over an hour of waiting on hold while she consulted a supervisor for her to come back and say, ""you used a coupon"". Yes. I did use a coupon, but as ALL coupons work, the amount is deducted BEFORE the amount you are charged. I even have the email confirmation from when I booked that reads:""Flight + Hotel	 	 $2,412.52Coupon Applied	 	 -$100.00Total Price $2,312.52""Which I explained again, and the woman was nice enough to forward me the cancellation receipt she had on her screen:""Subject:  Expedia refund receipt Here are the details of your refund:Date of refund: 2/5/2014Total refund: $2,312.52Amount: $1,282.20$1,030.32""Ok. Now we are getting somewhere....I thought. I explained again how what she sent me is correct information, however, those are not the amounts I received as a refund. So, she transferred me to the supervisor, who at first suffered from the same....lack of elementary math education....but then noticed...""there was a glitch""...AHA! So, after a few minutes of waiting for their system to load (which he also said was very slow), it seemed like my issue was resolved. I thanked him and hung up.3 days later...I notice my $100 credit is still not posted. So, I call back. The first call says there is an hour wait, so I request a call back. When I answer, it is static air, so I hang up. I get called back again, and press 1 to speak to a representative, wait for a few minutes only to be hung up on. Sigh.I call back, but now the wait is 2 hours. Fine. Request a call back. Same thing happens. Dead air on the first attempt, then on the second attempt I miraculously get connected to a person. Yay. I tell her I want to check on the status of my refund. She goes through the same lines again. How she sees I was refunded $2,312.52 on 2/5/2014. Sigh. I explain again. Again, she brings up this coupon. So, I explain again, and mention I spoke to a supervisor 3 days ago and was assured it had been resolved. She says she has to put me on hold for possibly 30 mins to an hour due to the weather causing a large volume of calls, so she can consult with a supervisor, but she can't do a call back, so I don't have to sit and wait again to resolve something that should have already been handled. Fine. I wait.After 30 minutes I am abruptly greeted by a man (Albert), who says ""you requested to speak to a supervisor for clarification about our refund policy"". Now, I am beginning to lose my cool. I tell him, ""No, I am calling to resolve an error regarding a refund I should have received."" So, again he mentions this freaking coupon. I explain again that the coupon is not the issue. The issue is that I was supposed to receive a refund for the amount I paid, $2,312.52, but I only received $2,212.52, so I am missing $100. I also mentioned my conversation with the other supervisor from 3 days prior, as well as all of the emails I have, which detail the amount I should have received and the amount I was actually refunded. He then in a very condescending tone says, ""Fine I will give you the $100. Is that what you want?""Have you ever seen a movie, where they briefly show a picture of an atomic bomb exploding to visually symbolize how angry someone in the movie became? That was me. I couldn't take it anymore. Not only did EVERY customer service rep I spoke to confirm what I was trying to explain (without actually understanding it), this man then tried to go and make me feel guilty for asking him to do his job, accept responsibility for Expedia's error and FIX IT. In a raised voice (but without defamation or profanity), I told him that is not what I want. I want Expedia to fix their error, and I don't appreciate being accused of seeking something, to which I was not entitled. Expedia is at fault, not me. If the person who processed my refund originally made a mistake (i.e. subtracting a coupon of $100 from my refund), that is OK, just fix it now. This level of incompetence and unprofessionalism that I encountered with Expedia is unparalleled. I even told Albert that I have already written about my experience on Consumer Affairs, and I would be writing to Expedia's president and would be mentioning him by name. (By the way I have never tried to escalate an issue this far, and I don't even normally write reviews online.) He said ""Thank you"" in a facetious tone. No wonder Expedia hasn't responded to the email I sent about my issue, or to the responses I gave in the Customer Satisfaction survey. From top to bottom, it is clearly ingrained in their corporate culture to NOT care about their customers. I don't believe the saying ""The customer is always right"", but when the customer IS right it is the expectation of the customer that you will fix the problem.If a class action could be started for the abysmal customer service that Expedia puts out there, I would have no qualms about being rewarded .46 cents (or whatever it is class members get these days) just so Expedia could be exposed for their complete and utter disregard of properly treating customers.(Side Note: I am still waiting for my $100. I have a receipt from Expedia that I should be getting it. In the meantime, I have let my credit card company know, so one way or another I will not rest until this is resolved.)

1879	            This has been, without a doubt, the worst customer service experience I've ever had. Expedia has been showing their incompetence repeatedly. They've run my credit card 24 TIMES. Obviously, the bank put a fraud hold on my card. Now, Expedia has a hold on my (ironically enough,) Expedia MasterCard and I can't get them to release it. Basically, I now can't afford to go with anyone else because there's an authorized hold on that card.

I normally wouldn't spend any time writing a negative review, but dummy me ended up reading the reviews after doing business with them and now it has gotten my blood boiling! I booked a hotel with them a week or so ago and was looking through my bank statement and noticed I was billed twice for the same stay? I contacted their customer support and after being disconnected once and spending almost an hour on the phone, a supervisor explains that they bill twice and one billing will go off in a couple of days? I contacted my bank and they are telling me I need to come fill out paperwork to dispute one of the billings. After reading all the other reviews, I honestly can't believe this company has been doing business as long as they have and investing in as many commercials as they do! Again, DO NOT USE EXPEDIA!        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive
1887	"            I have made so many reservations through Expedia and have never had a problem, but this very misleading transaction has left me feeling cheated! I had booked a hotel online for a friend for 4 nights and was quoted $132 in total. Unfortunately I had to change the dates and add an extra night, which meant I had to call customer service. I know there's always a chance that the hotel might charge you for changing the reservation so I made sure to check that I wouldn't be charged. When I called customer service the lady who was helping me said that there would be no charge and she would go ahead and change the dates. Everything was fine except the rates per night had changed, and she very quickly went through how much each night would cost. At the end she gave me a new price of $188, and seeing as it wasn't an insane amount more I said that this was fine. This is where it all went horribly wrong..when I checked my bank account there was a charge of $321 from Expedia (what??). I called customer service again, told them what happened and asked if it was a mistake. The man who was ""helping"" me explained that because of the price change per night, that the $321 was the actual total of the stay altogether. So in summary, I was told that I would pay $188 for the stay, NOT that it was an additional fee to the $132 I had already gotten!! Not once did the lady say that it would be $321 for the new charge, only that it would be $188!! Be very very careful with Expedia!! They are some shady and slick liars!!

Once I picked a mistaken hotel checkin date and they kindly allowed me a last minute date change, by phone.Today I had to cancel a flight and website was having issues. I called (yes they can take very long to answer due to enormous queues) but they finally resolved the problem and cancelled what I wanted to.Will use again.        	                1	5	Tuesday	expedia	neutral
1889	            I cancelled a flight with Etihad using Expedia as the booking agent. At first, it seemed normal, I have a $75 penalty, which leaves me $800 worth of Etihad credit. The Expedia agent cannot find their own cancellation email they sent me. The supervisor asked me to send them their own email back to them. Once that was accomplished by me, the agent on the following day still claimed that the flight ticket is cancelled without any credit. Once again, I had to talk to the supervisor, who asked me to call Etihad for another flight booking. Etihad refused to help me and sent me back to Expedia. I wasted days of work because of Expedia's incompetency at resolving issues and helping their customers. Every call I made take more than an hour of wait time. Often the call would be dropped, almost seemed like on purpose to avoid dealing with customers. Do yourself a favor, and do NOT use Expedia anymore. I sure learned my lesson the hard way.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	positive

I reviewed names, birth dates of passengers, itinerary dates (chose my bday week) before I hit OK to send and charge my card.  Happy as can be...booked condo, took time off from work for those days, and today I receive an itinerary that flight was changed to Nov with different dates and times.  We called the airline explaining we NEVER even looked at Nov dates when booking because it's for our special ocassion in DEC.  I reviewed the old itinerary and the dates that I agreed and reviewed before HITTING OKAY online, was changed to Nov.  There was DEFINITELY A GLITCH IN THEIR SYSTEM!  I would have NEVER chosen Nov (didnt even look at that calendar month) since the reason we are going is to celebrate the big 40 in DECEMBER!! We spoke to 5 different ppl and no one can do anything, but tell us our system doesn't show a glitch and you chose Nov. I could understand if it were the SAME EXACT dates chosen by mistake in Nov, however, the dates were off by a week…not even close!!!!!  The option they gave was to pay $150 FOR EACH TICKET or CANCEL!  Who has $450 to waste down the drain?? REALLY?!?!? The travel insurance is a waste of MONEY!!! Do NOT PURCHASE IT EITHER!  You have no protection!  (I purchase tixs regularly for shows we have every month;  this is not my first time purchasing tixs. I review everything and make sure things are correct.)

They just kept repeating things over and over and not understanding at all what I was saying. Then I was put on hold for 45 minutes to wait for a supervisor. You would think that in that time the supervisor would be told what the problem was, but no. I again had to sit there are explain the situation multiple times. Not only were they taking more time than it should have but the supervisor continued to talk to me like a little kid. I have never been to frustrated at a company's customer service. In the end we got the situation resolved but I was told ""We are going to do this for you this one time."" No I am not making an intense request. The mistake was on expedia end and I would appreciate if they didn't make me feel like everything is my fault. In the end I was thoroughly angered and upset with this company. I will definitely never be booking through this site again.        "	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

To my knowledge this had not been done, i have now had to deal with this issue 8 months later with the hotel taking out $1000.00 off my credit card - due to Expedia's lack of professionalism in finalising the cancellation properly.i have now been given the run around for the last 2 weeks, advising me that i will get a phone call with in the next 24-48hrs - WHICH NEVER HAPPENS! i keep calling them, and every consultant i have spoken to doesn't deal with the situation and i have been passed around to numerous supervisors who also advise i can not be transferred to the head office in the U.S. This is still currently an on going matter, WHICH IS STILL YET TO BE RESOLVED.will never use them again!!        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	neutral

1898	"            I booked my flight with Expedia only to find out that my contact after booking the flight would be through Hotwire and than the billing on my back account was with a company called Traverse.  No where was there any information regarding the connection between Expedia, Hotwire or Traverse.  My flight had to be cancelled due to bad weather conditions which I completely understand.  We were traveling as a family from Burlington, Vermont to JFK in New York to send my daughter off to study abroad.  We changed our flight due to the weather and received a confirmation of new travel plans.  I than followed up with the air line as I viewed on line that the flight they put us on had been cancelled.  Over the next 4 hours ""not joking"" in the time frame I remained on the phone line with a representative from Hotwire to re-book a flight.  To make it easier we decided to just have my daughter and I travel as we knew many people where looking for flights.  It was sad not to have our whole family be able to send her off but we were trying to be respectful of mother nature and the challenges air lines have when bad weather occurs.  Finally, the representative told me we could get a flight out for my daughter and I and put me on hold to arrange the confirmation.  Literally, in a three time frame she got back on the line with me and told me there was only one seat available.  I explained how could this be as she just told me she was going to make the final confirmation.  Furthermore, I gave up two seats to help the airline out only to have another seat taken away.  So alas, I continue to await four hours later on the phone for flight.  At this point it looks like we will cancel it all and drive.  NEVER, NEVER, NEVER USE EXPEDIA.  There company has to many affiliates which makes simple changes and communication basically impossible.  Very saddened and disappointed in their customer service.

I booked wrong dates, saw this within 15 minutes and immediately emailed  hotel - Cayman Beach Suites to cancel.  Reservation Manager immediately emailed back saying he would not process the reservation made in error. however, he went on to state that the cancellation process actually starts with Expedia's written authorization to their hotel and I needn't  have called him. Seeing the game,  I phoned ""Customer Service""  asking them to email the hotel. On the phone for an hour with an agent - no success. He said he'd lose his job if he did this. You now know who sets the cancellation policy and who gets the cancellation fees. Reprehensible and dishonest. No rude conduct though. Better dealing with hotel directly.

Fine, but then I wanted to make another change within their ""24 hour"" period to make changes, and they wanted ANOTHER $200. I tried saying, all I want is to change the flight times for the same day, and I only made this reservation 13 hours ago. Well firstly, I talked to about 8 or 9 people and NONE were native English speakers. I asked to be transferred to an office in the United States, but they said they were unable to do that (which is a lie). All they kept on saying was ""well our policy....."" ""our policy says...."" ""our policy this"" ""our policy that."" Well their ""policy"" sucks big time. Their policy should be good customer service skills that keep their customers coming back, not refusals to help them out. They'd rather suck hundreds of dollars out of you then to make your trip an enjoyable experience, like it's supposed to be. And they do it under the guise of their so called policy.

1902	"            Had to cancel a trip last November, but wasn't worried as I thought I was fully covered since I had purchased Expedia travel insurance.  The hotel was credited back to my card, but the airfare was processed as an airline credit and Expedia assured me they would reimburse me for the $200 per person change fee.  So, I supposedly had approx $1500 credit with the airline.  I research fares, and found they were about half the price that they were at November.  So, I called the airline direct to see what happens when a non-refundable ticket is reissued at a lower price.  They assure me I wouldn't lose anything and the credit would be carried into a new voucher.  So,  I called Expedia to rebook my travel, and was expecting to still have a $750 credit after I did this purchase.  NOPE!  Expedia informed me that the ""residual"" $750 would be wiped out.  They did offer to allow me to buy more expensive airline tickets, as somehow that would make me feel better.  Can you believe they suggested I buy more expensive tickets to eat up the money??? They also kept placing me on hold, easily half a dozen times, so I wasted an hour of my life talking with these idiots.  Plus, I had to talk to one person named Deena, who had to be one of the most rude customer ""service"" people I ever spoke to.  She never let me finish a sentence.  When I asked to speak to her manager, she told me it wouldn't do any good as I would be told the same thing.  I told her the airline said the credit would carry over, and she said the airline was incorrect.  So the airline doesn't know their own fare rules???So, if I were to purchase these less expensive tickets, the $200 change fee per person, which was to be paid for by Expedia, is now paid for by me as there is a credit balance.  So, Expedia gets off the hook for the $400 it should have reimbursed me, and I lose $750.  This makes absolutely no sense.How does a company like this even stay in business???AVOID EXPEDIA!!!

Both the Hotel and the Airline were very forgiving and very easy to deal with.  Both told me that they would waive the cancel fees due to my frequent stay/flyer status.  Both told me that Expedia needed to do the actual cancel as they owned the reservation.  When I contacted Expedia and very clearly explained this situation, the rep kept bumbling around, telling me she was sorry for the delay.  at the 39 minute mark she said, ""so I understand this correctly, you need me to call the hotel and Airline to verify that they've waived the cancel fees. Is that correct?""The whole 39 minutes I thought she was working on the issue.  Nope, it took her 39 minutes to understand the question!!  She then called the hotel, came back in 2 minutes and said ""they've asked us to call in an hour"".  I asked that she call me back and she agreed.  I gave her my number and haven't heard a thing from them since.The hotel rep sent me an email and called me at home to tell me she had called Expedia to tell them the Hotel would honor the refund but still nothing from Expedia.Avoid this disorganized group of no-nothing-incompetent-couldn't care less dopes.To beat all, they're sending me customer satisfaction surveys telling us all how important they take their customer experiences!! My advice to Expedia is to close down.  You're a joke to the industry and any traveler who simply takes the time to book directly, will fair far better than they ever could using this group of disorganized boobs.They could be $500 cheaper than any place else and I'd never, in a million years of Sunday's, ever consider using them and I see I'm far from alone!!

I asked to speak to a supervisor &amp; spent 30 minutes on hold before I even spoke to her, she also placed me on hold several times, rectified nothing, argued with me, &amp; ultimately made me waste another hour sitting on hold &amp; intermittently talking to her. I have never been so disgusted &amp; frustrated with customer service in my life. I have never dealt with a company so unwilling to right a wrong. And I have never experienced a customer service supervisor arguing with a customer. My soldier husband will make it back to his base. He will also sit in an airport for a long layover instead of spending that time with his family or at his base where he is supposed to be. No real thanks to Expedia. I will never use them again &amp; urge you to think twice before you do.        "	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative
1919	            I purchased a ticket back in November 2013 and cancelled that ticket on the website a day prior to the departure date.  I was sent an email by Expedia saying I have a credit of $468 and 1 year to use that credit.  Now, December 29th I am trying to use that credit and keep getting a run around by the company saying that I didn't specify a new departure date and that the ticket is unrefundable!!!!  I paid insurance on this ticket because I cancelled a previous ticket 2 weeks prior to this one due to work commitments.  I have used this website for years for the cheap tickets, but cheap tickets come at a huge loss..  I called last night, spend a good hour on and off hold times, having to wait for their supervisor to get back to them and more wait time.  This company doesn't even have operators answering from the USA.  They outsourced to other countries to save money.  Which is why customer service sucks so much..  I will never use this company ever again.  Currently I am still waiting to see if they will honor my credit after calling for the second strait day with no call back or email from them!!        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	positive
1920	            I had to book 2 different room type for my trip which required to call reservation : 1 bedroom with 2 adults &amp; 2 children (Queen beds/high standard room)1 bedroom with 2 adults (King bed/Standard room)It took 45 min for the sales rep (located in India) to book the 2 different rooms in same hotel. So incompetent ! I ended up with 2 reservations where she split my 2 kids in each room with extra guest fee for each reservation of course and a king size bed instead of queens bed ! I called back (still in India) to make the correct changes and I was told if any changes was to be made this had to cost me a fee as per whatever policy of theirs… She nicely offered to call the hotel to make sure the High Standard room was provided with enough beds for 4 guests and simply hanged up. I called 5 times and always got hanged up on before I could even talk to any sales rep… I ended up calling the hotel myself who couldn't do much besides lowering the standard of my room if I wanted to sleep with my children in Queens bed or charge for a rollover bed for my 2 kids to sleep in. Of course, no reimbursement was possible… I had a promotion code for 10% off and my hotel wasn't named in the exclusion. When I asked to have it applied they replied it was part of a chain hotel named in the exclusion and therefore couldn't apply it… Very borderline in terms of fraudulent advertising.

When I decided to cancel 3 days advance and my refund came to zero. So called Expedia customer service. She was nice but after contacting the hotel she said she can not Refund my money because hotel will not refund the expedia. So basically expedia says We Do not charge for cancellation but if the hotel policy is not to return money We can not refund you. But remember Expedia advertises on the same hotel free cancellation policy. That is false advertisement.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	positive
1923	            I booked a flight to Spain ($1,067) to say good bye to my terminally I'll grandmother. I then had to change that flight due to a medical emergency ($1,000 more) as my grandmother was expected to not last for more than a few days. I'm now here in Spain but need to change my ticket once again so I can extend my trip to plan a funeral. Upon calling Expedia to change I was bounced back and forth and am now going on 7 hours with no resolution due to being charged an incorrect fee (which I was told they 'would not refund under any circumstance') and them saying I have to call delta because they cannot help me. They want to charge me another $1,000.00 to change the ticket although I have medical documents to waive the change fee. My experience is that either you call Expedia and speak to someone who has no idea how to help you, or they pass you to someone else and 'accidentally' hang up on you. Words cannot express how angry and hurt I am. Angry that Expedia is unwilling to admit to their errors and horrible customer service. Upset because after paying $2,200 with them wanting $1,000.00 more, I cannot afford to stay and bury my grandmother. I have already started my campaign against Expedia on Facebook. I will not stop with bad reviews until they attempt to rectify this situation.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative

After over 3 hours of back and forth with 2 different customer service representatives I was told that I should go and see if the airline would give me a refund for the flight because despite the fact that they could find my reservation their system was having a problem and they couldn't book it.  I called the airline and they couldn't find the ticket number that Expedia had given me.  I called Expedia back.  I had to answer all the same questions and sit on hold all over again.  I was again told to contact United.  When I protested this I was put on hold again for another 30 minutes.  I asked to speak to a manager repeatedly and was never transferred to one.  They won't issue a refund even though it is their fault.  I'm extremely irritated and will NEVER EVER use EXPEDIA again!        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
1927	            Hi there, its my first time using Expedia and ive booked a hotel. A day later ive decided to checked with the hotel whether they have received my booking from Expedia as ive read many bad reviews about Expedia that sometimes your booking could not be found when reached the hotel. I was happy that the hotel reservation team stated yes and everything was in plan.Then few days later,  i've decided to cancel my booking as i've found another hotel that i prefer more. I've called Expedia customer service and in the call (automated operator), you can choose which section best suits your situation. I've pressed the refund booking section and was directed to a customer service agent in a few seconds and quickly she picked up. It was very smooth and efficient service from her and she was friendly too. No language barrier as stated in many other reviews, her english was good. She have cancelled my old booking and stated that my refund will be given back in 7-15 days and gave me a reference number as well just in case i would want to follow up the issue, if anything happens.To my surprise, 2 days later Expedia refunded me.(Expedia Singapore customer service) So yea i will still be using them in the future (maybe only for hotels, and not for flights, just in case.)PS: Maybe after booking with certain travel agencies online, one should double check with the hotels or flights, like what i did, just in case.Good job Expedia Singapore.        	                1	5	Saturday	expedia	positive

1930	            I had a horrible vacation that had been booked by Expedia. Now I cant blame them for the hotel but the thing is this. Right up until they got my money there was no language barrier. NO sooner did I have to call them to clarify something then I got someone that was a script reader and did not really have good command of the English language. I began contacting them from the hotel I was at about the very bad experience I was getting. After 2 replies from them I gather that they were responding to me without even reading my emails. Lastly on this subject after 2 responses from this email addy they send me one saying that they do not respond from this addy and to write to another one. Now if I had been able  to get through to them while I was at the hotel they (if they might have in the first place) could have tried to intervene for me. That did not happen. After coming back to the states I got on the phone and after over 2 hours of repeating the same thing time after time after time. After being cut off three times (rudness personified) I was offered A $100 credit for another occasion. Now they have no problem offering this as they know I will not be using them again. So if they offer something that will not be used they have lost nothing. I got language barriers coupled with passing the buck with some apathy thrown in just for good measure.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1931	"            Based on my experience with this company I will never use them again under any circumstances and would give the same advice even to my enemies. There is no way of getting through to a person of any authority and their email address only gives an automatic reply, despite stating in an email sent from the same address “If this does not answer your question or solve your problem, feel free to reply to this message”. Reply to the message simply generates an autoresponse.  They are also evasive on the phone. They deal with questions on the phone that they do not want to answer by cutting the line. Additionally, they are liars. I am trying to get a refund for flights which were cancelled due to a close family bereavement. They sent me an email with instructions on how to this via sending a fax. They ignored this fax. A long call to customer services ensued in which I explained the problem but the response was to restate the instructions which I had been given by email, which I had followed and, since this had had no effect, I was calling to follow up about. This was not acknowledged. The instructions were to send a fax to Expedia - number supplied - with the statement that ""Once a decision is made by the airline, we will advise you of the outcome through email."" The CS agent explained that I needed to deal direct with the airline. I demurred, stating that Expedia needed to ensure that the fax which I had sent in good faith was passed on to the appropriate authority. They then hung up on me. I assume this is their protocol. I am still working on a way to get a response out of them, complicated by the fact that I am calling from abroad and these phonecalls are costing me a lot of money, not to speak of time and energy. I will never ever use this company again.        "	                1	1	Monday	expedia	positive

They told me I bought a non refundable room and the date could not be changed. They said it was non refundable due to the low rate. I checked the hotels website and they had the same price as I paid on expedia and I could cancel the room with notice. Expedia has terrible customer service and they provide no real service.

1935	            This is the second time I've an issue with Expedia and I am fed up.. Their customer service people need to be more educated on how to deal with what the customer wants. This trip I booked to Tahiti. i told them I wanted to stay from Tuesday to Monday. The first flight this idiot recommended was a redeye flight that would get me there the next day even though he booked my room for the day of departure. This is the second trip that someone has recommended a flight like this. These people are not very educated and this person could not understand what I meant. To recommend a flight at 11:25 PM on technically the day I should already be there is horrible. I explained to them that I wanted an in water bungalow and the guy continue to try to sell me Rooms that were on land. He kept on saying let me finish . The best part was them recommending a flight the island I was staying on . There was a five hour Layover . This was a horrible recommendation due to there are fairies running all day that takes 15 minutes to go what I needed . They could have cost me over 10 hours round-trip if I would've let these So-called experts booked my trip . I got so frustrated I  and asked for a supervisor. Even the supervisor misquoted me and made me think I was getting a good deal . I'm very thorough and asked several times if this is round-trip and for two people and every time she said yes. At the end when I was ready to make a purchase I find out that it was twice as much due to the language barrier these people have. I suggest finding another company to go with.

1936	            When renting a car through this company be very careful about what you really will end up paying: the amount they quote you will be a far reach from the final cost particularly if you are renting at an airport-insurance, taxes and surcharges are common add-ons by the rental company and expedia makes no effort to tell you this. Also the rental companies charge an exorbitant price for any gasoline they may have to add to return your tank to full.

1937	            I searched for Hotels in Brooks, Alberta and Expedia.ca jumped up.  When I looked for vacancies and rates, I found three rooms that I liked and so I asked to reserve them.  Expedia asked for a credit card to confirm the rooms (there was no indication that I was paying for the rooms at the time).  When we got to the Hotel, the receptionist said that I had already paid for the rooms through Expedia!  This would have been sort of okay, except our business trip ended four days early and so we checked out.  The Hotel said that I had to contact Expedia for a refund and an invoice for the room charges!  Expedia at first would not give me a refund.  After threatening them, they called the Hotel and started negotiating the refund.  But, I did not call back to ensure that the refund negotiations were continuing ... they weren't.  What kind of system is this?  I think it is very close to fraud what they do with Hotel reservations.

1948	            I used Expedia a few years ago for some vacation packages and they were a great company to deal with. They have changed, probably because they have now outsourced their call center employees. I booked a vacation package with them, purchased the travel insurance, and then had to cancel. They refunded the hotel and car and gave me a flight credit on my next flight. When I called to reschedule, I was on hold for an eternity. Then one person was able to deal with the flight credit, but I had to be transferred to another to book the hotel and car which entailed more hold time. If you get annoyed with the rep for anything, they hang up on you ON PURPOSE and you have to start all over. This happened several times. The kicker is, you don't save money going through them or any other third party agency. We used our flight credit because we had to, but decided to go on our own to book our hotel and car.

I booked the flights, and only a week later (when Expedia did not charge my CC for the airfare) realized that because of the title that Expedia added to my first name, my first name was not spelled correctly. I called them to rectify the problem. I was on hold for more than an hour, and was at the end told that because my first name is misspelled, I will have to cancel my airfare, bare the burden of cancellation fees that the airlines will impose on me and buy more expensive tickets if I still want to travel to that destination. It ended up that all this circus is my fault. So, I went ahead and called the airline, and they actually helped me fix the problem without canceling my reservations. Believe it or not but the airline agent was nice and quick. The airline put into their system that my name is not misspelled, and that the first two letters in my first name indicate a title. The problem was fixed just like that. And then I called back Expedia to let them know how to assist other customers with the same problem....and they told me that....oh, yes the title in front of your first name does not mean your name is misspelled.

For example apparently the number they told me call for the airline company is the wrong one and now im on the phone still trying to figure this out because EXPEDIA AIRLINES is the wort company I have ever dealt with. please there are many other companies out there and as a friend I would like to ask you to not have your business with them. feeling EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED.......        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative
1952	            Hi All,I was trying to get information on a packagedeal. I pushed, flight and hotel information. The darn thing kept adding a rental car! I would resubmit and it would tell me OOPSsomething us wrong try again. After 3 attemptsI gave up, if I am having this much trouble in just trying to get info. I figured I would really be screwed if I needed help.After reading so many complaints I can see why. Thanks for honest consumers who telltheir experiences and warn others!        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative
1953	            Called Expedia phone number to get seat assignment and boarding pass since Asiana would not let me do it.  Agent spent 5 min telling me three times (exact same words were used)  that her computer does not let her do that. HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO TRAVEL ON THIS TICKET TWO DAYS FROM NOW I asked her.  No answer or pondering that question.  She tried to start again on how she CANNOT help me. I ask for a manager.  I am waited  5 min for her supervisor to come to the phone.  Ms. Journey came on line to repeat how they are paralyzed to do anything else for me after I coughed up over $2000 for the ticket.  Has NO absolutely NO regard for how I am suppose to travel without a seat assignment.    This is the worse web site and I recommended No one to use this service!!!  She specifically said she is NOT allowed to make a phone call to Asiana to make it possible for me to get a seat and a boarding pass so that I can travel in two days!!!!  Not interested in helping a over $2000 transaction after you got my money.  I  Do not recommended  buying  tickets thru Expedia.  IT is my first and LAST time.  Whether you fly or not is of NO concern to them!!!  Can you imagine buying an appliance for over $2000 and having someone tell you they really don't care whether it starts or not?        	                2	1	Monday	expedia	negative
1954	            Recently had an issue with a hotel that I booked through Expedia.  Then last weekend I had an issue with a car rental place through Expedia.Long story short, I didn't save a dime.  In fact, I could have gotten cheaper rates if I had used the companies directly.  Additionally, when I had an issue, both the hotel and the car rental company said to speak with Expedia.  Expedia said it was the hotel and car rental company's fault.  Like two dopes pointing at each other to escape responsibility.Who needs it.  When my flight got cancelled last weekend, I didn't speak with Expedia, I spoke with America.  There is no need for travel agents anymore.  The only benefit that you get now, is that Expedia stores your personal preferences.  After my last two experiences with them, I'll never use them again.  Whatever convenience using their service brought me, was paid for many times over in $$$ and frustration.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative

I suppose if nothing goes wrong and you don't need help Expedia would be okay. But if you need help don't look to Expedia to help you out! First you wait on line for an hour then you get someone who can hardly speak english. I don't understand how they can stay in business, I will never use them again! My travel agent looked after my visa and gave me personal service at the same price! So long Expedia, I forgot how to spell that! So bad!        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
1956	"            I tried booking through expedia.com and the browser kept changing the dates after I hit confirm.  It did this three times, so I called them to notify them of the mistakes.  The young lady with expedia stated she was having trouble making the changes and when she finally got it corrected, it changed the price which was much higher.  nearly 45 minutes on the phone and she could not fix the issue, so we advised her to cancell all the reservations.  I immediately went down stairs of the current hotel we were staying at and cancelled online before the 4pm deadline requested by expedia.com.  Apparently she only cancelled one, because I saw two charges on my account.  A partial refund was issued for the two bookings.  This was discovered when we got home and I checked my charges.  I called expedia immediately on 7-20-13 @ 1150 pm central.  The lady stated she observed that I had made the appropriate cancellation and she would have to contact the hotel to see if they had charged for one day before she would issue the cancellation.  After the hotel told her it would take an hour and expedia would have to check back.  I advised that I received a cancellation email from expedia before the 4 pm deadline so I did not see the need for me to wait for my refund.  After an hour and 10 minutes the expedia rep. states she can not see the cancellation time and I have to call corporate office after 5pm on a sunday.  I stated that no one works at the corporate office after 5 pm on a sunday and I needed her name and the case number and I needed to speak to a supervisor.  After waiting 40 minutes longer on hold I finally spoke to a supervisor who stated that she could see the time I cancelled and that it was 4:20 pm eastern time.  When I stated what time I made the reservation the rep stated I made the cancellation at 12:43 am.  When I asked if she was sure she stated ""thats what I said"".  I then advisd here that it was incorrect that I made the reservations at 12:30 pm and cancelled them approxiamtely 40 minutes later because I was on the phone with their representative.  She then stated that she was mistaken and I would have to contact the corporate office, because they did not have the authority to make those changes.  I then asked for the number and she refused to give it stating I would have to contact them today at 5:00 am pacific time.  I am going to call them tomorrow and if they do not do the right thing I will file a formal complaint with the better buisness bureau and reverse the charges with my bank which will be given a copy of the e-mails that expedia sent me with the date and time.  Even then I still cancelled hours before the system sent the e-mails.  No matter they are in the wrong and waisted over two hours of my time and I am mad.  Trust me I will never use them again        "	                4	1	Sunday	expedia	negative

1958	            Several days ahead, I made a motel reservation for myself, my husband, and our daughter.  I specified ground floor, since my husband (81 years old) does not balance as well as he used to, and I (73) have much difficulty on stairs.  We arrived at the motel to find that they had no record of our reservation, for which I had printed out the specifications and the reservation number.  The front desk clerk told me this was the third such incident this evening.  Being too tired to look for another motel, we accepted the only room left, on the second floor, with one bed; the motel personnel brought in a roll-a-way bed and discounted our rate.  Our daughter was able to assist us up the stairs and carry our luggage.  We certainly won't ever use Expedia again!        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative

1960	"            My husband's experience with Expedia is also a bad one. But after reading the reviews, it seems he got off lightly compared to many of you.My husband had to go out of town for work on short notice and had to book a hotel at the last minute. He had trouble finding one that was available for the first night of his stay. He checked Expedia. The room he ended up booking was touted, with the supposed advantages, like ""close to the main road"", etc. . When he got there, he found it was a very seedy motel in a ghetto-like area.  He is being charged the price of a nice room, and he figures he is being charged double what anyone else who stays there is paying.During the day, he is taking his suitcases in the car, because he doesn't trust leaving them in the room.This is our first experience with Expedia; and needless to say, it is the last.  After seeing the other reviews, I don't see how they stay in business.        "	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	neutral
1961	            Unlike many reviewers, we actually had a good experience with Expedia. We used Expedia to book our hotel stay. United Airlines (which we booked directly through them) changed our flight time without informing us, so we showed up to the airport 4 hours earlier than we needed to and then missed our connecting flight when the now new later time was then an hour late getting to the runway. When we arrived in Houston the extremely rude United employee informed us there was no way we could get to Seattle (our destined location) that night, even though we had already paid for a hotel there through Expedia.It's now 10pm of the night we were supposed to check in, I called the hotel and they said they couldn't do anything since we booked through expedia. So I called expedia and got to talk to somebody in about 5 min. They pulled up our booking, called the hotel we were supposed to stay at, and then called me back. They gave us a full refund for that night even though it was within the non-cancellation time block. They didn't have to, and we didn't expect them to, but they did. It was a very nice move by Expedia.com.        	                1	5	Tuesday	expedia	positive

1964	            I booked a last minute trip to Vegas.  We decided on going with expedia because their package included show tickets.  It was difficult to get the show tickets booked.  When I was in Vegas I tried again to get the tickets booked and again couldn't.  So I called expedia to get help, boy was I naïve,  after 20 minutes of the run around I was passed up to a supervisor, who told to pay for the tickets myself and fax the receipt to them and they would reimburse me, by doing a charge back to my credit card.   So I did, and sent the fax that day from the hotel.  I expected that if would take some time for the charge back to show on my credit and boy was I right,  after a month and a half, still no charge back.  I believe I was lied to, just to get me off the phone and expedia never had any intention of doing what they said.  So bottom line is Expedia does not honour their agreements and have no concern for their customers.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative
1965	            I took Expedia vacation waiver and unfortunately I had to cancel my trip. After cancelling I was told that the airfare would be kept as airline credit and I have to use that for my future use. So far so good. But when I tried to rebook using the airline credit. It was a horrible experience. 1. The moment you say you are calling for booking a flight ticket using an existing airline credit the call gets disconnected.2. The customer care representatives have no idea about their own EXPEDIA policies.3. It took 10 minutes for the line to be connected and they keep you on  line for another 30 minutes beating around the bush.4. Even the floor supervisors do not know the exact information. I was told that for reissue of ticket with the existing airline credit I have to pay $150 airline fee and for reimbursement ( since I have an expedia vacation waiver), I was asked to contact an insurance company. When I asked why should I? I took the policy from EXPEDIA then the supervisor was beating around the bush.5. When I called another supervisor he told me that EXPEDIA would be reimbursing the money.6. I spoke to clauria, myrtle, and Mary. supervisor (SPENCER, Emp no 013467). Finally the one who resolved the issue is jordyn - supervisor, agent sign - av1.7. After booking the ticket again with airline credit I called today for finding the refund status of $150 fee charged. Then again the SAME STORY STARTS.................

I called Expedia to complain and they said that in my booking, I requested for 2 doubles... Who in their right mind would book for 2 doubles wanting a king. I told them that their website was misleading and they should rectify it... I did not get an apology or alternative and wasted 30 minutes of my time and would have wasted more as they were just trying to frustrate me by not hanging up.

1967	            Expedia misleads between booking and confirmed booking; showed up at hotel and it didn't have my reservation despite that Expedia booked me (I was stranded); I called Expedia and was placed on hold for over an hour, hung up on a couple of times, supervisors were as bad, reading from a script and being totally unresponsive or helpful.  It sounded like a zoo in the background.Expedia also misleads on flights when it purportedly assigns you seats; it does not.  I assigned my seat and months later when i was checking in my ticket was without a seat assignment and I wound up getting the worst seat on the plane in an international flight.  Check in was horrible as I couldn't do it on the Expedia sight and had to go to the airline site directly for help to just check in, which wasn't easy as my ticket was done through Expedia.Overall, its customer service is horrific; untruthful and rude; they keep you on hold forever, checking in occasionally to see if you hung up; Expedia is a chop-shop operation.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
1968	            I booked a trip to Maui through Expedia. I was going to book it online but noticed when it came time to select the seats on the flight, that there were not two seats together. I called Expedia for advice. The agent said it wasn't a problem and she would find two seats together. After a few minutes of her and I comparing the same trip I had found online, she quoted me $7 more for the same trip. Ok, not a problem I suppose. Everything was the same as the online trip otherwise. She gave me seats #30A and 30B on both flights going and coming home. A few days later, I called Alaska Airlines to double-check on these seats and was told that I did not have two seats together. The seats the Expedia agent told me I had were for children. Basically, I booked the trip, paid a little more for it through the agent over the phone and didn't end up with seats together. The agent purposely lied to me to get me to book the trip. I would have changed my flight or dates to be able to sit with my husband on the trip. I am now stuck trying to call Alaska to see if there was a cancellation and if not, trying to get someone to switch with me at the airport.

1969	            Expedia: Losing Faith in Customer RelationsToday after an hour of arguing and being placed on hold I gave up. Tomorrow would have been one month of attempting to attain compensation for faulty information that will put me out at least a stack of cash. For the past month I have been told repeatedly that this situation is my fault however, today I was told that the situation is my fault because I did not know that in some cases Expedia customer service representatives tell customers things to make them happy. Translation: a representative lied to me to make me happy?I was also told that the only compensation the company could give me was a $50 voucher for a hotel (no flights). Unfortunately, that voucher would mean using Expedia again for something I don't usually use a third party to book. No Thanks. *I was told over 72 hours ago that within the next 72 hours I would receive a callback concerning multiple ongoing inquires pertaining to my flight change. I have also been told the following:*It is possible to only take only the second leg of my flight however I would not be refunded. (This e-mail prompted me to buy tickets to stay in Europe and not take the first leg of my flight)(Protyasha 6/3 via e-mail)*That the airlines were the ones that were charging Expedia to change the tickets --_Justine 6/20 (After calling the airlines I was told Expedia was the only one who could change a booking)*I could change my reservation for a fee and would be able to conference call with the third booking party -Justine 6/21 (This never happened even when I called at the time we discussed on the phone)*I can not change my reservation at all and will get a call back within 72 hours to talk about compensation for hours on the phone and miss information from Expedia --Faizan 6/25 (I NEVER received this call back after waiting almost a week)* My case had been moved to high priority and I would receive a call back in 24 hours. (This never happened either) This serves as a written record of the slew of miss-information I was fed. Apparently customer service agents at Expedia and Expedia UK are taught to appease customers by telling blatant lies or to hang up if they do not know what to do. When I finally talked to someone who could give me a straight answer (Either buy a 1,400 pound one way ticket or revert to your former plan eating whatever cost I put into the other tickets.....and P.S. there is NOTHING Expedia will do to compensate you for the money and time they have put you out) there was nothing I could do. Why would a company lead me in circles by telling me I could have conference calls and that they were looking into my case when that is all they needed to do. I talked to as many supervisors as I could and was told different things by each.I will never use Expedia again.The End        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1970	            We booked a room on the phone through expedia and it was dirty, nasty and did not have the amenities we requested. Made a call that night after quickly leaving the hotel. We were given a case number and a promise with a follow up in 4 days. Nothing happened. I called back they had no idea why nothing had been done, another case number and another 4 days. Nothing happened. Spent at least 2 hours on hold today, went all the way to corperate management and still nothing. I called the hotel myself, spoke with manager and worked out the refund, of course after more time on hold. Robin who was suppose to be a coperate manager had no concerns for the lack of follow through, or customer service. She actually wanted to transfer me back to the customer service rep whom I was speaking to. Though they gave us 25$ discount on our next hotel booked from them the first night, they can keep it, I won't use them again!        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

Travel agent booked me a flight+hotel which i want, keep telling me his screen is ""frozen"" maybe just a glitch whatsoever he ask my credit card and paiid $1,411He sent me an email. On the email he sent itinerary no. which says ""please book now"" and i cant find the itinerary no. on my account but i can see on my credit card that 1411 was taken out of my account 2.  my sons name and my last name was spelled wrong although i keep telling him how to spell my names in detail, within an hour i called ASAP and talk to that same travel agent. Itold him that he made a mistake booking me a flight and a hotel. he transferred me to a customer service she decided to just cancel everything and give me my money back. she said 7-10 days. then  i just booked another flight and hotel doing it my self eventually cus i cant wait for therefund and i dont know how long it will take in the first place. i used my husband credit card same amount flight and hotel. everything was good with the one i booked right spelling write amount and i can see my itinerary booking and confirmation online.june 23.. just to follow up with an email i complaint about the situation they replied within 48 hours time frame. they said flight was cancelled but hotel is still booked ??? like okay i thought its cancelled but how come right? i called again and a travel agent said booked duplicate in a hotel so he cancelled one of them . he cancelled the one i booked which is supposed to be the original booking  the travel agent made has to be cancelled. another mistake on this one. by a different travel agent!  to make the long story short.  june 25 i insisted to talk to one of the supervisor because of so many mistake i asked for refund receipts in email  in case i need to dispute them and if i dont get my money back. he confirmed that i will be getting refund and he gave me a compensation of $200 refund because of their mistake..today when i checked my credit card flight has been refunded and hotel also !! looking good so far, Bad things about expedia is that its really big company that they will make customers wait on the phone for freakin two hours on hold. and keep transferring you to different people. I spent my friday, saturday, sunday, and monday talking and calling them and making a complaint! so key here check your email all the time and itinerary no. to make sure theres no change so far. check the airlines and phone the hotel to make sure that you' have reservation. expedia might change something without your permission! be aware. and if you see a mistake call them right away, email and ask for confirmation receipt. now. i'll will be leaving in two weeks and im hoping everything will be good..

1973	            I booked three round-trip tickets for myself and my two minor children on Expedia.  I completed the reservation after selecting three seats  together for both legs of the trip.  I would never allow my children, who are nervous on planes, to sit next to a stranger.  After I paid for my reservation, I noticed that the seats I selected for the return flight weren't noted on my reservation so I called Expedia.  I was told the seats I  selected were special  so they couln't be confirmed but they'd send a message to the airline requesting that I be seated next to my children.  I never heard anything until I checked in and noticed that my 8 y.o. was  seated between two strangers and my son and I didn't even have a seat assignment.  It cost me an extra $177 to get three seats together.  When I called Expedia customer service I was disconnected four times while I was waiting to speak to a supervisor and no one ever called me back despite being promised twice that they'd do so if I was disconnected again.  In all, I was on hold for nearly an hour before I finally gave up and refused to call back a fifth time.  Please use Travelocity or another competitor!

1975	"            Customer service support is absolutely terrible! It took me nearly an hour to just wait for a *correct"" answer for the cancellation policy of my international flight, and the answer they gave me later turned out to be incorrect. One of the people there told me the flight was refundable and I can cancel the flight anytime, even before the departure date. A few weeks later, I called again to cancel, and they told me that the flight is non-refundable.  I was bewildered because there was no way I could fly overseas the next day. I have arranged important meetings with my clients over the next few weeks already. If I had known this before, I'd have arranged my schedule differently. The most absurd thing is that NO ONE took responsibilities, even the supervisor. I ended up cancelling my flight, which means a loss of more than $1000. I even called the airlines to see if there was anyway they could help me, but they could not as I booked through Expedia. They even said that many customers had issues with Expedia before. This is ridiculous!        "	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

1977	            At the last moment before booking, I asked one small question about cancellation fee which turned out to be ridiculous. I refused to pay fee for cancellation then later we agreed that there will be no charge. So I asked the rep to confirm the $0 charge cancellation fee thru Email to me right away and before finalizing the trip's booking. The rep confirmed to me on the call that she sent the Email and immediately asked me if she can submit the booking which  I declined and asked her to wait until I receive and read the Email she sent me. Well,  the Email came and there was a $102 charge for cancelling the trip.  She lied to me and tried to rob me of $102 after we agreed to $0 charge. I Immediately cancelled the booking .Note: Always ask for Email confirmation on conditions you agreed to and read it before continue with booking        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
1978	            If I can give no starts I would have. I was trying to book a vacation package, the first time Expedia charged the card even though the booking didn't go through due to an error in the flight they offered, the second time they virtually charged my card when I was trying to split the cost between two cards and the other one didn't go through. Virtual charging acts like actual charging and the money can take a couple to days to come back to the account. The kick is that the credit department works from 9-5 on weekdays and 9-1 on weekends, and it manually faxes over the request to cancellations to the bank. The banks don't process them unless it is a business day.

Two week later I looked at confirmation that said check on flight confirmation in 24 hours. My fiancé checked and the flights that we upgraded at 209$ pp were changed to get us to Vegas at 945 pm!! We upgraded so we could get there and get wedding license. Called customer service and the agent kept trying to charge us to change flight. They changed OUR flight, not us!! After an hour on phone we finally got a manager that speaked English well. Finally we added another night and got better flights for 130$. I would never use Expedia again. Bookit.com is the way to go! We even paid for can to and fro airport that they "" didn't see"". They tried to ruin our wedding!! NEVER again will I or anybody I talk to ever if I have anything to say about it!!        "	                1	2	Wednesday	expedia	neutral
1980	            I used priceline a couple of times then I booked a trip through Expedia more than month ahead of my sisters wedding in Hawaii. Bad mistake. They charged fees when they advertise none. I paid them...But, After a couple of weeks they requested more money to confirm my already booked and paid for trip. A $800 ticket became $1600.How is that legal?Then they cancelled my trip when I refused but made me wait almost a month for a refund. I tried to explain this was my sisters wedding but found no one who had a heart. These guys should be investigated. If this wasn't criminal then I don't know the definition. Called Priceline; explained the situation...they booked the original itinerary. For just a few dollars more....but all at the last minute.  Saved me more than $700.        	                2	1	Wednesday	expedia	neutral
1981	            I had a trip for $ 464.00 last Labor Day (2012) and my Dad was very ill (passing at the end of Sept) so I had to cancel the trip.  I have booked through Expedia in the past and when I cancelled I understood that I had one year to rebook.  I did not know it was from the date I had booked the original ticket, I thought it was from the date of the trip.  I was informed today that it had expired and my $ 464 was in their pocket.  I will NEVER use this service in the future.  This company has stolen $ 464.00 from me and did not have to do anything to earn it.  I work too hard for my money to give it away and don't feel that there should be a time limit on you using your own money before the company steals it.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative
1982	            Tried to rebook a domestic flight 5 days before takeoff. Prepared to pay for charges etc to do it. Sounds simple right? I even went to the trouble of ringing the airline first, and confirmed it wouldnt be a problem. Rang expedia. 48 minutes later, was told by a customer service person, that it couldnt be done. I told her that was not right, because i had spoken to the airline in the previous hour. She told me i was 'not listening to her' and when I asked to speak to her manager, was told 'my manager will just tell you exactly what im telling you'. She then left me on hold until i hung up.I sent a strongly worded complaint about the way I was treated. i explained that I was rebooking to spend time with a gravely ill family member. I was responded to with a stock standard apology and a $50 voucher for future travel (with a handful of caveats which meant I would have to spend a few hundred dollars to be able to use it).I wouldnt recommend this company, even to my worst enemy. Expedia is a joke, but the consumers suffer as a result. Rude and incompetent customer service staff should not be tolerated by anyone, let alone paid for!        	                2	1	Monday	expedia	negative
1983	"            Avoid calling customer service at all costs. It took 90minutes to cancel and rebook my flight from New York to London. The return flight came back at a different airport - even though I told the agent this many many times she still could not find the flight and when I told her to put her supervisor on he said ""Oh, she got confused because it's a different airport then your departure"".  When I told he I told her this many times he was not apologetic in any way. This was after having the same problem with another attendant until I got disconnected somehow and had to start all over again with a new person  - so I actually spent about an hour telling both of them ""I am looking right at the flight - it returns at a different airport.""  It was so bad that I will now use expedia as a last resort.        "	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative

1986	            Expedia has terrible customer service. I have made more than several bookings with them in the past online and they have all been fine... BUT! I recently had to call customer services with my recent and current travel booking as there were certain requirements that required me to speak to a customer service representative as the options weren’t available online. I would strongly advise all to avoid Expedia as I am still getting the same problems two weeks after the initial booking which I was assured were corrected on several occasions. Apart from the poorest customer service I have ever experienced I had passenger names spelt wrong and wrong titles were given - Mr instead of Ms, etcetera. Three out of my four passenger bookings were incorrect.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative

1988	            Because I was in a international long distance relationship, I used Canada often to travel to and from Montreal, Quebec and recommended them to many people because of their cheap plane tickets. However, I had never had to deal with their customer service until recently. When I booked a flight, a made the mistake of booking it with my married name instead of the maiden name, which is what is on my passport. When I called to correct the mistake, it was a nightmare. Basically the agents I dealt with were misinformed, hard to understand, and not knowledgeable about airline policies. The airlines was telling me that they couldn't touch the reservation since it was booked through Expedia, but that name changes under my circumstances were permitted and all Expedia had to do was follow a certain procedure and my name would be changed free of charge (the procedure was very simple and easy to access on their website). When I called expedia and told them this (I even read them the airline policy!), they 'called' air Canada to verify and ended up telling me that they wouldn't do it and that I would have to cancel my reservation and book a new one under the correct name. All in all, it was going to cost my quiet a bit to travel at the dates I had planned. I broke down and started crying on the phone. Eventually I just hung up and had to breathe. I called Air Canada back and their agent was helpful. They helped me find a cheaper flight to book and told me to call Expedia back and cancel/reschedule. Since I didn't think I had a choice at this point, I called and talked to a booking agent. For once, someone was helpful. When he asked me for my reservation information he inquired as to why the name was wrong. When I explained he informed me that they could and would change the name on my reservation. It took them 5 minutes. I was on the phone for a total of 5 hours that day. I was cut off, put on hold, and belittles multiple times. I was distraught, emotionally drained, and very upset. Sure, I ended up getting what I wanted in the end but it took way too much to get there. I've book a total of 10 flights through expedia, and I will never do so again. I've also had a bad experience with their Insurance. Never purchase it. Ever.Here is my story:        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative

1992	            In summary, when I had to change a non-refundable airline ticket, the expedia rep on the phone let me know that the TOTAL charges, including the $150 airline ticket changing fee per person would be $630. When I got the bill it was for $998. I then attempted to contact customer support to rectify this issue and got nowhere. They seemed to think I cared about the technicality of their billing system when I clearly let them know that my frustration was with their employee that misinformed me into making a horrible financial decision. I could have easily just booked a new flight for much cheaper than the actual total cost of this ticket exchange.Below is the email correspondence between Expedia and I, just to give you the direct experience of their lack of customer care.*My Original Expedia Customer Support Comments: Regarding my upcoming flight:I recently had to change my flight and was told that including the $150/person fee, my total cost was going to be $630 to switch it. When I got an email receipt, the total was over $990! Please tell me where the discrepancy comes from? With a charge this big I would have been better advised to book a new flight which would have cost less than $700. I am an unhappy customer and looking for some answers. Please let me know why this occurred.Thanks,Gary        *From Expedia Elite Customer Support:Dear Gary,Thank you for contacting Expedia about the discrepancies on the charges made to modify your flight reservation.We apologize for the misunderstanding with regard to your travel purchase.Our records show that you called us on May 09, 2013 to change your flight reservation.You purchased a ticket that is reusable but non-refundable and non-transferable. United Airlines collected USD150.00 per ticket change fee and any possible fare difference when you rebooked your reservation for a total of USD317.50 per ticket.When a customer changes his or her flight reservation, the amount he or she pays does not reflect on his or her itinerary. In its place is the price of the new ticket that was changed into.Hence, we assure you that United Airlines only collected the amount of USD634.30.We appreciate your patience.Thank you for choosing Expedia.AnakinExpedia Customer Service Team*From Me to Expedia Elite Customer Support:Hello,Thank you for the email, however this does not accurately address my concern. I am aware that United Airlines only collected $634.30 and that is fine. What I was email you for is the fact that your representative told me that the total amount I would be billed, INCLUDING THE FLIGHT CHANGE FEE was going to be $634.30, I even asked twice to make sure that was accurate. If you listen to the recording of this phone call you will hear what I am telling you.The point is that if the total really was $634.30, it would be on par with the cost of a completely new flight. With the actual total cost almost reaching $1000, it would have been considerably cheaper for me to just forget about the original flight and book a new one-way flight. Please understand my frustration. I spent at least $300 more than I needed to based on your employee's misinformation.I am a loyal customer of Expedia and I ask that you should hear my question, respond to my concerns and let me know what we can do about this problem. Thank you for listening.--Gary*From Expedia Elite Customer Service:Dear Gary,Thank you for contacting Expedia about your feedback on your changed flight reservation.We regret that your experience with Expedia.com was not satisfying.

1993	"            Very bad expierence !!We booked a hotel room from Expedia.  It was a non-smoking one-bed room at Super 8 near Riverwalk at San Antonio. We paid about $150 for one night through Expedia's ""Unpublished Rate"".  However, when we arrived at the hotel, we found it is only $120 for the walk-in price. What makes things even worse, Super 8 told us that Expedia booked a smoking room for us, and there was no non-smoking room left!We then contacted Expedia customer service, first they denied that we booked a non-smoking room.  After we pointed out that we had a printed itinerary with us which specifically said non-smoking, their superviser asked us to drive to an airpoit hotel and pay another $80 for a non-smoking room!  Can you believe it?? Of course we couldn't accept this offer, but they didn't even let us cancel the reservation!!!! It is a really pain to deal with their custom service, as they don't want to fix their mistake and shamelessly asked us to pay for it. Their attitude was bad, too. We spent one hour talking to them and got nothing but disappointment. We will never use Expedia again and advise others to avoid them as well for their own interest.

1994	            Do not use Expedia to book a flight, ever.  I know I will never use them again.  I booked a flight for my daughter last night, and received an e-mail from them this morning saying the airline had cancelled my daughter's reservation.  I called them immediately to see why, and was told that the entire flight had been cancelled and that my checking account had not been charged.  I called the airline to make a reservation for another flight, and found out that the entire flight had not been cancelled, but the airline had no record of my daughter's reservation.  I made a reservation for that same flight with the airline company, but then found out that my checking account had been charged twice - once for the amount of the ticket through Expedia ($300), and once by the airline for the reservation I made with the airline ($326).  I called Expedia about being charged twice, and they simply did not care.  I was told that it would take 72 hours for the charge through Expedia to be credited back to the account.  The people at Expedia told me at that point in time that sometimes the airline will cancel a reservation that they (Expedia) made if the cost of the ticket has increased.  So Expedia lied about why the reservation had been cancelled, and I wouldn't have even known it was cancelled if I hadn't looked at my e-mail account - they should have called and told me - my daughter could have shown up at the airport in two days and not had a flight.  They also should have made sure of the price before taking my money, they should have made sure my account was not charged for a reservation that the airline company didn't have for my daughter, and they should have made an attempt to straighten it out rather than just telling me that it would take 72 hours and there was nothing they could do about it.  Why would anyone use a company like this - I never will again!        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	neutral

This is the first and last time I will EVER book with them, and I will be passionately deterring my friends from making the mistake I made. I had an issue with a double booking for my honeymoon - $1200 tickets - the flight was booked twice so the airline had two duplicate passengers, which I feel warrants a refund. I have now spent well over 15 hours on the phone since the beginning of April, the first 6 of which were spent re-explaining my situation and request because they had no ""record"" of my initial contact. After some diligence they managed to get some of their memory back, but still no refund. They have ""called"" American Airlines a number of times (although I could not be conferenced in on the call)....asked if I would like a call back and NEVER received a call. Then they said they attempted to call me and that I did not return their call, and that I would now have to pay an additional refund fee since an alleged waiver had expired (I have never seen nor signed nor agreed to a waiver). I am still on hold awaiting the final resolution....SUFFICE IT TO SAY, WORST COMPANY I HAVE EVER WORKED WITH.        "	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative
1998	            My girlfriend booked a 2 bedroom suite through Expedia at the Residence Inn Mariott on The Mag Mile in Chicago, IL.  She received a confirmation email stating the hotel room was reserved.  Upon arrival at the hotel, we were told there was no room reserved under that name.  At this point, the hotel was all booked.  Not to mention, majority of the rooms downtown at all the hotels were booked.  So, 5 young ladies were stranded in the streets of Chicago with nowhere to go.  We called Expedia, and sat on the phone for over 2 hours with them.  Expedia did not offer any sort of assistance.  We even offered to pay for a room in our price range and they cover the difference for a comparable room.  They were not accommodating at all.  We had dinner reservations and a concert to attend, and missed out on both because we had to search for a hotel.  We were able to find a hotel with one room available that had two small beds.  Not very comfortable for a group of ladies.  Someone unfortunately had to sleep on the floor.  If Expedia would have followed through with our reservation, everyone would of had a comfortable sleeping area.  The Residence Inn stated that they have been having problems with Expedia booking the rooms at the hotels.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  Especially to leave 5 young ladies stranded.  How does a large company like that not offer any type of accommodations???

1999	            Tried booking a trip to Europe through Expedia, but it failed with an unexplained error. I called their customer service and they said they were unable to complete the transaction. I looked at my account and I saw a pending transaction for the amount of the trip. The phone rep told me that it would take them 72hours to remove the charge and by the time that was done the price would have gone up. She informed me that while I was on the phone (40min) the price of the package had gone up by around $40. Quite plainly this was a lie. I was on their website at the time of the call and saw that the price had not changed. After 48 hours I see that the price of the package has not gone up by a single dime and the charges are still on my account.At the time of the call I asked if there was any way to get the charges removed faster. It is not exactly convenient for me to have a pending transaction of several thousand dollars on my account for 72 hours. The phone rep told me (barely withholding herself from laughter) that I would need to dispute the charges with my bank. I asked if they could make a merchant call to the bank and let them know of the error so this might get done faster but they just kept giggling in the background. I thought they taught you how to use the mute button at call centers but I guess things must work differently in India.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative

2001	            To all Expedia customers - you need to be advised that Expedia are operating a biased review system on their website. I have twice tried to submit a review and they are refusing to publish it - presumably because it contains negative information about the hotel. The only review 'rule' that I can guess has been broken (they don't have the courtesy to advise you what the problem is) is that I have referred to personal information in terms of my husband having had an accident in the hotel spa- but this does not explain why I read another reveiw for this hotel where a personal story and great service has referred to (someone visiting and their partner broke a limb while staying there/the staff were wonderful etc. etc). It seems it is fine to cite a personal story as long as it is positive - but if it is negative Expedia censor you. Funnily enough, I will not be using Expedia again after this experience and I advise you to avoid using them as well!        	                19	1	Saturday	expedia	neutral

There were three of us traveling to Hawaii.We only needed a room for the first night of our stay. Expedia recommended the Aston Beachside in Waikiki. I was told that it would accommodate 4 people. I also paid for a flower lei to be waiting at the airport when we arrived.When we got to the airport, my two friends who ordered their leis had a representative meet them with their beautifulFlowers. Mine never showed up. We left the airport and arrived at the hotel where we were told right away that we could not stay as their rooms only accommodate 2 people. I asked for a refund and was told that I would have to take it up with Expedia . The manager then found another place for us to stay. It as more than the room I had booked through Expedia.When I called to complain to Expedia I was told that there was nothing that they could do about it.

At the end of my booking, I was informed that the order would not be processed and I assumed it was because it was a debit Visa, not a credit card Visa. An hour later, I noticed on my online banking that Expedia had withdrawn $919.40 from my BANK ACCOUNT. I was on the phone last night several times and spoke to several people. I was on hold for a total of 78 minutes. NO ONE would listen to me and kept insisting it was just a credit card authorization. It was NOT. Your company physically removed that money from my bank account which I absolutely did not authorize you to do. Your customer service reps are rude, spoke over me and yes, I was angry, however, putting me on hold and not coming back is unacceptable. If one of them would have just listened to what I said, I may have been more successful in explaining my issue. The ""authorization"" does not need to be ""dropped"", I require a REFUND back into my bank account of the money, and I want that money returned immediately.

2006	            Purchased a package including complimentary show tickets but was not informed the tickets had to be reserved within 72 hours of purchasing the package.  Called Expedia when we got to Vegas and rep said voucher is still good. Cannot get tickets because MGM Resorts is telling voucher is expired and the issue is with Expedia. The MGM rep told us this happens a lot. Called Expedia back and the rep did not know how to handle. When we asked to speak to a manager, we were put on hold and then hung up on. Beware!  Never make your buying decision on these complimentary show tickets that do not exist. Someone should start a class action lawsuit to make Expedia accountable for this bait and switch marketing ploy. I will never use again!!!!        	                2	1	Thursday	expedia	positive
2007	"            All we wanted to do was book a nice vacation in Las Vegas. We booked our flight and hotel with expedia because they offered a great deal. We received an email no more than a week later stating that our flight had been changed. Now to clarify we choose this particular flight because we would've had a two hour layover which we wanted in case of any delays so we wouldn't have to go running for our connection flight. They changed our layover to less than an hour which we didn't want. We had purchased the insurance so we called expedia today to see if we could either change the flight or just cancel the flight part of our package completely. The rep placed us on hold to check something and we were disconnected. We called back and there was an hour hold time. We waited the hour time to get a call back. When we requested to speak with a supervisor b/c the rep we had talked to never called us back, the new rep placed us on hold. After about 15 min straight waiting on hold, they came back to say we would be connected to a supervisor only to be disconnected during the transfer. We called back yet again to only have another hour and a half wait time. When we got a call back again this third time, the rep said they would transfer us to the supervisor only to be hung up on yet again. The fourth time we called we decided to just ask for a supervisor to call us back instead of being transferred. A supervisor called back after about an hour and while dealing with him, and then being placed on hold, he hung up and never called us back. We decided to call back one more time and if Expedia didn't get our issue solved we were going to dispute the charges. We finally got someone from corporate on the phone and had them handle the issue for us. She then tried to justify why they didn't call us back because ""they have so many customers"". Is that a valid excuse to not call a customer back if there is a disconnection? I would say no. This is all just because we wanted to change a flight. Do not use this company if you value your time and do not want to deal with this aggravation.        "	                1	1	Monday	expedia	neutral
2008	            As I type this, I am on the phone with their incompetent customer service department, and have been for 2 hours and counting. After trying to book a vacation package with them I was told that they pre-authorized the 2 credit cards that I wanted to book with. (One was a VISA Debit). I didn;t end up booking the package and decided to book the next day. I called back the next day and tried to book again. I was told I couldn't because I would have to wait 72 hours for the first pre-authorized amount cleared. Obviously they don't understand how travel prices fluctuate. I wasn't about to wait 72 hours to MAYBE get the flight I wanted and get it at the same price. So, it ended up that I wan;t able to book. Fine. The next day (today), I check my bank account, and over $1000 was debited from my account for a booking I NEVER made. I called customer service about the situation only to be hung up on 3 times and have EXTREMELY rude reps try to help me. Between all of my calls to them, I have spent over 5 hours on the phone with them (so far), and have no trip booked. This is the worst experience with ANY company I have ever dealt with. Don't bother with Expedia.ca. I guarantee you the worst experience of your lives. Don;t expect any problems to be handled in a timely manner either. Even if it's CASH being wrongfullly taken from your account.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	negative
2009	"            I am so disgusted with Expedia and their lack of service. I was trying to book a trip yesterday via telephone and after being on the phone for over an hour I was booking the trip and paying with my credit card. After the operator took all of my credit card details and was processing the payment he told me that the price of the package had just gone up $400!! I replied by saying that ""you where already processing the payment for the original quote and that this was ridiculous that you expect me to pay an extra $400 now after I have given you all of my details for the original trip"". I then told him not to proceed with the payment as I wasn't prepared to pay an extra $400. I then checked my credit card online to find that Expedia had debited $900 OUT OF MY CREDIT CARD FOR TRIP THAT I NEVER BOOKED!!! I am so annoyed and have sent two emails that have yet to be responded to, and by reading the reviews on this website it looks like I will be waiting weeks for a refund!!!!

2010	"            We booked a flight for a cruise. The cruise was cancelled (Carnival). My sister who had booked directly with Delta, called Delta and explained what happened. They waived the $250 rescheduling fee. An hour later I called Expedia and explained the situation.  The first rep said they would check with Delta, She put me on hold and after five minutes was somehow on a brand new call from scratch with an entirely new rep. Explained the situation again and she refused to check with Delta, insisting on going with their formal written policy. I was transferred to her ""supervisor"" who made me start from scratch saying that I had given the previous rep ""no information."" By the time I finally done, the price for the flight I wanted to switch to had gone up nearly $200. No empathy, canned responses, unwilling to go the extra mile. Sill had to pay that fee for switching our tickets. Should have booked with a different company.        "	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
2011	            I paid an extra $20 for a room with a water view in Chicago.  When we arrived at the hotel, we were told there were no rooms with a view available.  So basically I paid extra for the possibility of having a water view.  The hotel manager was great and gave us a $50 gift card at their restaurant.  But it just does not feel right that Expedia took extra money for a room upgrade and gave us nothing in return.  I will not use site again.        	                1	1	Sunday	expedia	neutral
2012	            I booked a room at Cleveland clinic to take my mother to a heart specialist. The date of our appointment changed and I called expedia to modify my reservation. The representative who answered spoke little English and I have to believe the call was routed overseas. I was told that the computers were down and that I would have to call back. Over a two day period, I called nine times and was told each time that I would have to call back. I explained that I was trying to modify the reservation by six o'clock and was advised that there would be no problem. When I finally was able to get though the next day, I was advised that I would be charged for that night and for a block of four nights even though we were only staying for two. I will never consider using this company again.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative

Obviously not enough room for 4 people.  I then was required to pay an extra $30 to 'upgrade' my room to what I originally requested.  Customer service kept subtly blaming me for their system malfunction.  ""Did I select right"", ""sorry it's non-refundable"".  They did offer me a $50 coupon - but I'm all done with my travel booking so I'm not sure when I can use it.  Plus I am forced to deal with them again.

2014	            They changed my flight schedule and claimed they sent notification a few months after I booked my flight via email.  I went to check my baggage costs and found a completely new flight, hours after the one I had booked.  We have a cruise to board and all they said after hours of holding was that I could pay fees and the cost of a new ticket.  I changed nothing, they screwed me completely without my knowledge.

2015	            When I first made reservations I had noticed the return date was incorrect.  I tried to call and change it.  After waiting for over 40 minutes I had to hang up.  I am a busy person, but I had it on my to-do list and called back a few days later.  After waiting on hold again for along period of time I was informed that to change my ticket for the one day I would have to pay the $250 change fee plus the change in rebooking all my tickets.  The price came up to $2000.  I could have found a cheaper ticket just to buy a new one and informed the customer service representative.  She actually suggested it and said she could search for another 1 way ticket.  WOW.  I paid the fee and simply bought a new return ticket.  I called them back while in Brazil because I noticed that when they changed the return flight that they had also changed my connecting flight.  I needed to land in Rio for a few days.  The whole process started over, and I may again be paying at $250 change fee plus the difference in changing my whole reservations again.  I WILL NEVER USE EXPEDIA AGAIN, and I highly recommend that no one else does either.

Before using this website check out others I found the lower fare on Hipmunk.com and I am so angry that I believed Expedia was a reputable company.

2018	"            Deciding factor to use Expedia was ""2 complimentary show tix/room""  After booking they only provided 1/ticket for each room and a coupon for another activity.  Then I found out that you can only book the Expedia comp tix through the website.  Because expedia put one ticket on each room, and you have to enter the room number to book the ticket, I couldn't book two seats together.  Called MGM (cust svc # on website), they said I had to call Expedia because the hotel didn't have our rooms under the ""entertainment package""  Called Expedia - Louis said the comp tix were ""expedia gifts"" and the underlying tone was basically, I should be lucky to get the gifts, they don't care if I can use them or not.  He offered no solution, other than to keep repeating that they were ""gifts"".  So basically, they nullified the entire reason I booked the package with them and I won't be back.

2020	            Beware of the Unpublished Rates option through Expedia's site. Using this service doesn't allow you to choose your amenities in the room and it eliminates the option for choosing a nonsmoking room too. I recently used Expedia to book a two-night stay using the Unpublished Rates option because I thought I'd be getting a good deal on a nice hotel. Um, wrong.  In reality, I was staying at a very low-grade hotel and in a smoking room. In addition, I found out from friends who were also staying at the hotel that I didn't even get the room for a good deal. The price I received was very average and it actually would have been cheaper if I had booked directly through the hotel site because of Expedia's fees.Upon checking in to the hotel, the attendant told me that Expedia uses the Unpublished Rates campaign to sell rooms that otherwise would probably not be booked. Because the hotel was full, I had no option to change rooms and was forced to endure two nights of a smoke-filled room. It was unbearable as a nonsmoker.  I wrote Expedia to tell them of my poor experience and they sent me a canned response about how my stay was nonrefundable even though I, at no point, asked for a refund. Their email went on to say that Expedia was 'sorry for any confusion this caused me' although I was never confused, just upset . I won't be using Expedia again, and if you don't like unpleasant surprises, I'd recommend you don't either. You know what they say: 'Where there's smoke, there's fire' and believe me if you use the Unpublished Rates option through Expedia, you're going to get burned.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	neutral
2021	            Seriously don't waste your time or money because you will lose a lot of both. I purchased the protection plan which boldly states that both hotel and flight are 100% refundable. Two days before my flight i got the flu and couldnt fly based on ym doctors reccomendation so I called to cancel my flight and hotel. I am currently on hold and have spoken with eight differemt people and have been on and off hold since 3pm. It is now 5:20 and they are telling me my ticket is non-refundable and I am now waiting to be transferred to the corporate offices. During this time I have dealt with rude, impatient, and mumbly employess two of whom actually yelled at me then hung up. Needless to say I will never use Expedia again and if I knew anything about the legal system and had more money I would probably sue them. There has to be something illegal about selling someone a plan and then breaking that agreement? I am now out not only the money for the flight and hotel, but also for their bogus insurance plan.

I got insurance policy number with my itinerary but there is no such a detail which suffice the need of embassy.

2023	            I won't bore people with the details.  I will only say that while the process of scheduling hotels, flights, etc... online is smooth and easy, dealing with their customer service is a nightmare of galactic proportions.  If there's any possibility whatsoever that you'll need to change or cancel a reservation do yourself a favor, pay the small extra amount to go directly through the hotel or airline and consider it money well spent.Dropped calls that aren't returned, each subsequent calls requiring starting from ground zero, not listening to what you're saying, but instead apparently reading off a script is just a small part of what I had to deal with.

2024	            When booking on line, Expedia over booked me. After spending 2 hrs finding the right number and being transferred around the country they refused to cancel bookings without a fee which was equal to the hotel charges.  They also called the hotel where my reservation was to ask if there was a cancelation fee, upon finding out there wasn't, the hotel refunded Expedia, and Expedia kept their money and mine, hows that for working both sides of the table. The reason  I know this is, after not getting any results with Expedia, I called the hotel back to find out when all these rooms had been booked, and they remembered me and the call from Expedia.  I am out raged, I will work through my bank and will report to the Attorney General so this doesn't happen to anyone else.

2025	            I made a reservation online with Expedia.com for a hotel room with jacuzzi.  Rate was about 125.00/night, paid in advance.  Unfortunately, I made it for the wrong date.  I noted the mistake and called them to correct the date within one hour.  They said I could cancel the reservation, but I would receive no refund.  They said that this was due to the hotel's policy.  I called the hotel (Baymont Inn) and they told me they had no issue with changing the reservation dates.  The manager told me to have Expedia call her, and she would handle it.  I called Expedia again, and Expedia modified the date in their system, but did not call the manager and get it changed in their system, even though they said they had done this.When I arrived on the reservation date, I found out that I had no reservation on the appropriate date.  The hotel informed me that they could not change the date; that their system showed my original reservation date.  They told me to call Expedia and have them cancel the reservation, but I would have to pay for the current night.I called Expedia and they refused to make it good for me.  I informed them that I would no longer use their services, and I would inform others of their lack of customer service.  I also found that the rate that Expedia charged for this room was more than the rate that I could have gotten the hotel room directly from Baymont Inn...a double insult..        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative

After long waits ""to talk to their supervisor"" 2 of my  calls just hung up. I called the hotel directly and found out that the re-booking cost was $50 higher that dealing with the hotel directly.  Bottom line I had to pay for a reservation not used. The Tripadvisor web site said it was a refundable rate but the fine print said it was refundable for about 6 hours. Help put the Ex in Expedia.

It's been a while since I traveled, but based on my previous experiences, I trusted Expedia. They have changed! This is what happened: I am planning a vacation in the UK and I wanted to stay in London for 2 nights. I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights at Tune Hotel - Paddington. Later that day I found out Expedia over charged me by $229, plus, Expedia charged a $25 fee for each room each night. The Tune Hotel website charged less. So, I thought I would take advantage of the ""Best Price Guarantee"". I called them up and my booking matched all the criteria accept the Tune website did not covert British Pounds to US Dollars. They would not cancel my booking either. So, I'm out $229! Travelers beware! Expedia wants to rip you off! Never book a hotel with them without researching your choice thoroughly before hand!

2034	            10 days before my holiday trip I logged in to double check my itinerary and print a copy.  Our flight was supposed to have one stop in Atlanta, but the flight out was missing and the flight back was also missing.  According to the online itinerary, we would be stranded in Atlanta since only two flights were logged and they both entered the city without connections out of that airport.  I called customer service and was told that this was a temporary glitch on the website since they were performing some maintenance.  The agent on the phone gave me the full itinerary over the phone and emailed me a new one.  All of this is fine... except that one week later I logged in again and it was still a mess.  Except this time there were only flights leaving Atlanta and none arriving.  I've printed out the correct itinerary that I originally got and I'll probably have to call them again to confirm this.  But I'm extremely disappointed that a travel agency with an entirely online business model would flub so severely on a bread and butter aspect of their service.  How am I to trust that when I get to the airport I won't suddenly discover that I don't have a seat?  Or worse... if I get to Atlanta and then discover I'm stuck?        	                1	2	Wednesday	expedia	negative

2037	            Expedia is good as long as you dont make any changes to your reservation again. I made an international booking thru expedia for $3000. I did it for my friend whose mom was ill and I thought booking thru expedia would be a quick option. That was my biggest mistake. My firend did travel but he was not able to travel back as per the original reservation. I called expedia to make a change to the reservation. We did change it to a new date and they mentioned that additional charges woudl be  $400 and I requested them to charge my card for the same.. I thought I was done with that. But my friend called me after a week and said that as he checked with malaysian airlines to confirm the return journey and seems they menitoned that the reservation is not confirmed yet. So i called expedia to re-confirm and they mentioned that they were not able to charge the addn cost for some reason. The suspected that the credit card that they charged on did not go thru. So I gave a new card and then it was all set. After my firend flew back and later after couple weeks when I checked my card, i was surprised to see that the total charges made my malaysian airlines was $4144.53. Almost $600-700 was additionaly charged on my card.So I started calling customer support and that was another nightmare. Until now i must have spoken to 5-6 support people. They say that they dont see any of the charges due to the reservation changes in their end and looks like they have to work with back office to get that info. It was so ridiculous to hear that they dont have details for the charges they chages. They raised a case id and they informed that they would contact within 3-4 business. But never they did.They were not able to produce me till now the details of the charges that they charged my  card. They now want me to contact malaysian airlines since my credit card is being charged by them. But malaysian airlines wants me to work with only the agent who made the reservation and changes as they were the responsible party.I am not sure where  I am headed rightnow. It been almost 1.5 months. I am thinking of disputing my credit card charges. But fnever I would go with expedia for any travel again.If expedia wants me to work with airlines directly to resolve these issues, then why would I go thru them in the first place. Also customer support is horrible. Bluntly they did hang up me. Also its fully outsourced. No one clearly understands what they are talking about. Customer support is provided in india, malaysia or china I guess. Everytime I call after business hrs in US, someone from either countries respondand no one has any idea about the issue and they just simply dont care that they have looted and charged my card.Btw my expedia itenerary no is #151350156810 and till now ever since I made the reservation, i am unable to view my itenerary online. Ultimately i thought I could help my friend. But I regret I must have made better choice. Should have dealt with sirlines directly. Expedia is a crap.        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	neutral
2038	            Having booked with Expedia for over 10 years, I can safely say this is my go-to place when I think about making travel plans for a few reasons:- Expedia is the only travel agency I know that offers loyalty points so I get coupons that can be applied for future bookings- I'm super-sensitive when it comes to credit card info (especially after finding out two of my friends had their identities stolen after purchasing with small companies), so it's nice to book with a well-established company like Expedia and know that my info is safe- In times of need, Expedia comes through for me. Once when I had accidentally made an error on my reservation (wrong dates), it was easy to cancel and rebookI'm currently working towards getting the Expedia Elite Plus status so I can get the free room upgrades. With the holiday season coming up, I might just make it!        	                1	5	Friday	expedia	positive
2039	            Expedia.com is my go to resource for all travel bookings. I've used the service enough that I'm now an Expedia Elite Plus member which gives me extra perks and bonus rewards points when there are specials. My most recent travels were to Palm Springs, CA and Las Vegas, NV. Expedia.com had a ton of great hotel options for both locations, with great pictures and details of activities/attractions nearby that really helped me pick the right hotel. For Palm Springs, I chose the Viceroy Hotel, a VIP Access hotel which are hotels that offer free room upgrades to Elite Plus members. When I arrived at the hotel I received a free room upgrade - got a room almost double the size of my original reservation and a view of the mountains! The hotel met my expectations based on the pictures and details on Expedia, and exceeded my expectations for the quality service as an Elite Plus member.For Las Vegas, I opted to book a package (flight and hotel). The website is very easy to use for building packages and shows you the cost savings by booking in a bundle. The search results displays the total price for packages by hotel. Then you can change your flight from a list of options for departure and arrival. Each flight shows the additional cost on top of the initial display price, so I was able to manage my package within my price point. It was an easy process, I was happy with my travel arrangement, and I earned extra bonus points for booking a package. I highly suggest booking online travel through Expedia.com for ease of the process and all the available options.        	                5	5	Thursday	expedia	positive
2040	            I was double charged for a flight. When I called to get my money back and explained that their website had somehow booked me twice for the same flight they were unhelpful and did not feel it was a problem to deal with at all. So I had to seek legal matters on getting my money back. Here's a tip: DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!!!!        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
2041	            I have used Expedia to book several flights in the past few years and every time I have, it's been a successful traveling experience. When I traveled to Kenya, I booked through Expedia and saved roughly $700 and was able to find flights that had minimal layovers. That made it ideal since the combined plane rides were already about 17 hours. Also, I've used Expedia to book flights to Oklahoma, Las Vegas, and Las Angeles in the recent months and was offered a wealth of travel options with departure times that worked well for my busy work schedule and that were reasonable in price. I am hoping to do a lot more traveling in the next couple of years and Expedia will definitely be my go-to search engine for flights!        	                1	5	Monday	expedia	positive
2042	            My best friend and I decided to go to Spain.  We booked our flight into Madrid and out of Barcelona 15 days later.  We also booked our first and last nights hotels in each respective city.  Thanks to Expedia, that was a breeze!  Our plan was to backpack through Spain and go wherever the wind took us.  Each morning we would get up and decide where we were going next.  Expedia made it super simple to book same day hotels and find hopper flights (we went to Majorca for 2 days).  It was THE BEST VACATION OF MY LIFE.  And we wouldn't have had that experience without Expedia!        	                1	5	Monday	expedia	positive

2048	            I suppose I made a flight online for the wrong time; however, that is debatable if you looked at my past iteniaries which all happen around the same time.  Spoke with Manager Meg (ID # AR9) and she was unable to help.  I told her as someone like Meg would refer to our sob story and she could have cared less and refused to help.  It will cost $300 to fix a flight I had for my husband and 4 year old to fly to see me and my 9 year old who is currently undergoing his 2nd bone marrow transplant due to leukemia.  He only gets to see his dad once a month and Expedia could have cared less.  I will never use them or their sister companies again.  The manager they have representing their company did not have to be as cold as she was even if she was unable to help and she is a front for what the company stands for...not good in by book.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	positive
2049	            Expedia is the best customer service I've had for travel (or anything) for a long time!! I had a very substantial overcharge on my account from Thrifty Rental Car and Expedia handled it like pros. I'm getting a refund from Thrifty and Expedia credited my account for $50 just for my hassle. Now that's what I call customer service! They contacted Thrifty Rental on my behalf after I unsuccessfully tried to bring it to Thrifty's attention myself. As a result of Expedia's diligence, Thrifty finally escalated my issue up the chain to corporate HQ. Expedia said Thrifty will contact me with the total amount of my refund. :) Expedia also gave me a $50 credit toward any service on Expedia for my problems with Thrifty!

2051	            I am deeply disappointed in Expedia.  They issued an itinerary between Seoul and Beijing that conflicts with China Southern Airlines transfer policy. I purchased a ticket they recommended. I receive ONE notification on the issue via email. Luckily I saw the email in my junk box and was able to call Expedia. But that is where the problem got worse!Called at 5 pm Seoul time.  Not once, not twice, not three times.  The calls were disconnected and not a single operator called me back or took notes on the account.  I was told to call back at 9 am central time, 12  am my time! I did.. I have been on hold over an hour! And... I was told to call back in 3 more hours!!! Really?!?!?!I am tired and disappointed.  I hope my travel experience is nothing like this.  I wish Expedia would do a better job of pairing compatible itineraries and of ensuring when customers call their concerns are noted.  I am hopeful this issue will get resolved... however, it should not have taken as long as it did and it should not have required me to stay up half the night!!!!!        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	positive

2057	"            I frequently book flights on somewhat lesser-traveled routes-- Entebbe to Ho Chi Minh City, Monrovia to Casablanca to New York, etc.-- and just when I expect a letdown in the online booking dept, Expedia always comes through with sunshine.  More than just securing the flights, however, I have been impressed with Expedia's response to ""problems"" which arise.  When I've had to cancel reservations, or a hotel accidentally charges me twice, or a car rental charges the wrong rate, Expedia has been immediately accommodating, with the most friendly service.  Treating you like a real person and understanding your situation.  Settled and done, just like that.  And so I keep coming back.  simple as that.  now off to Maputo!

2069	            Expedia can be a mixed bag- some itineraries are really good, as when I went to Bahrain, and some are silly, like when I flew Houston to Denver via ATLANTA???, which took 12 hours for a normally two hour flight. It is very difficult to get the automated system to bring up any logical changes, guess that is what you get for going for the lowest price.So far as booking hotels, look at the Expedia site fist to get a range of hotels, then try contacting the hotels directly- you can often make a better deal yourself.        	                1	3	Saturday	expedia	positive

2071	            As I said, it was always easy with expedia but in the past 2 years their prices are not the best for Asia Pacific travels (good for the Americas).Positive: easy to use, several options of travel, fly-car-hotel combo at times is pretty good, like filters on where I can categorise per star, price, etc.Negative: prices are lately not always the best, too many emails with promotions and then when I check up the prices are not promotions at all and competitors have better prices, prices on the american site are not clear as don't include taxes (hotels) and then when it's time to pay cost much more, not possible to search flights per alliance and not all airlines are offered (I remember few years back provided options were much more wider) and once I call and I had a feeling of calling a call center in India rather than Australia or USA.I think Expedia is a product with a lot of Potential but they should review above.

Save up for a huge hotel or flight coupon, or grab smaller coupons along the way. There is NO WAY that I'd ever veer away from Expedia. I've made hundreds of reservations thru them over the years - flights, hotels, packages - in the US and around the world - they're batting 1000 in my book.        	                2	5	Friday	expedia	positive

The Expedia Rewards program has been incredibly helpful for me, and the benefits I have on their branded Citibank card have been terrific.

After our hotel was booked I found out that Expedia had double charged my account. Additionally, the hotel had no record of our reservations and it took several calls from me to clear up the issue. Upon arriving at our hotel we were informed that children were not allowed in the hotel and that we would have to leave. It was 9pm and my 2-year old was exhausted! Furthermore, neither Expedia or the hotel was willing to refund the $120 we paid for the hotel because we did not read the fine print. At no time during booking our stay did I see anything about guest restrictions based on age.

Recently, before embarking on a trip to Mexico, an Expedia agent called us to see if we had all our travel arrangements planned, and if we wanted to add any tours during our stay. I haven't heard of another online travel agency to have the bandwidth to take care of each and every customer in such a manner.I highly recommend them!        	                1	5	Wednesday	expedia	positive

Their loyalty program definitely pays off and is a great way to get rewards in addition to airline miles. They also make it pretty easy to add (and save for future use) the frequent flyer number for the respective airline while booking your flight.I had to deal with an incident once where I booked a flight for the wrong dates. I usually hate dealing with call centers, but canceling and re-booking my flight through Expedia’s customer service was a breeze.I’ve generally had a good experience booking hotels on the site because it seems to provide me enough good information (maps, good descriptions, good quality photos) to make an educated decision about which hotel to book and which neighborhood to stay in. This is especially helpful when I travel to locations that I’ve never been to before. I’ve also noticed that they’ve been making more and more changes to their site recently that have made it an even more pleasant user experience.

2089	            I usually compare several sites each time I book a flight or hotel (~5 times a year). Expedia almost always has pricing that meets or beats the competition. Not saying this happens every time but I've generally been happy with the rates. I've seen a number of negative reviews about experiences after the point of booking and upon reaching the hotel. To date, I personally haven't had any issues but I do tend to book on 4 to 5 star hotels in the U.S. or Europe, which may have more consistent service levels. I've always had smooth check-ins with my reservation always waiting for me.Expedia customer service has always been helpful enough if have questions or need to make a change. Recently, I realized I made a mistake on a flight booking after I purchased the flight. Customer service was able to easily cancel the reservation and I just re-booked with the correct passenger information.Lastly, I'm fond of rewards programs and ease-of-use. It's pretty simple for me to book a hotel as all my information is saved. Receiving Expedia points on top of my other hotels and airlines is also a pretty nice perk.I've been a consistent Expedia customer for years and I don't see that changing anytime soon. I have no problem recommending this company.        	                2	5	Tuesday	expedia	positive
2090	            On my recent trip around Europe, I used Expedia for every piece of my trip and I am so glad I did!  Expedia was great for helping me plan my trip and decide where to go and what to do once I arrived.  Once I made my decisions, booking was easy and the communication and confirmations of all of my travel plans were thorough and timely.  I will always use Expedia for all of my travel needs!        	                1	5	Monday	expedia	positive
2091	"            Booket one week accommodation in Rio de Janeiro through Expedia.co.uk. The write-up and information on the accommodation was excellent so we felt confident of an excellent time in Rio de Janeiro. My wife as pregnant at the time, so we wanted somewhere close to amenities and her Portuguese school in Ipanema.We arrived at the hotel to find that it was, in fact, a flat with two rooms that were let out to paying guests (and all this through Expedia!). Many of the hotel descriptions were false. There was no double bed, only a day bed with a pull out bed. No safe, dirt all around, no en suit facilities - had to share communal bathroom. Made a complaint to Expedia by phone shortly after arriving at the ""hotel"". They spoke to the owner while I was on the phone with them and advised that I should find alternativa accommodation in the middle of the night and with a pregnant wife!As we had chosen the ""hotel"" due to its location and convenience, we decided to stay there and await for our complaint to do the rounds inside Expedia and in hope of a refund.After over 30 days waiting, this is what we received from Expedia:' Reference Number: X114784111Thank you for choosing Expedia.co.uk Since receiving your complaint regarding the Ipanema Copa Rooms, I have contacted the property with regards to the issues you have raised. They have offered to change the rooms but you have declined this. With regards to this particular hotel, unlike our Expedia Special Rate Hotels, we do not have a room contract with the property and our website is used as a portal by the hotel to facilitate booking. This is why payment is taken by the hotel directly upon check-in/out. I regret that my response cannot be more favourable and hope that, despite your recent experience, you will continue to use Expedia.co.uk for your future travel arrangements, hereby allowing us the opportunity to restore your faith in our company. I trust our position in this regard has now been clarified.  Regards, &lt;Name Removed&gt;Tier 3 Senior Research SpecialistCustomer Relations Department for the U.K. and Ireland 'I am a very regular business traveller to Brazil and have almost always booked both hotel and flights through Expedia.co.uk, but I won't touch them again even with a barg pole. They are very happy to take your money, but will abandon and leave you high and dry and the first sign of problems. They are not to be trusted.You have been warned.Regards,George        "	                3	1	Monday	expedia	positive
2092	            I book about 5-10 trips per year on Expedia, and it is simply the best travel website.  I have also cashed in for several free hotel nights via their loyalty program, and this is on top of my airline miles.  Two thumbs up!        	                1	5	Friday	expedia	positive
2093	            I've booked on Expedia for years and never ran into any issues.  All of my reservations have been booked accurately.I find it interesting that hotel owners are writing bad reviews on this site for online travel agencies and simply telling people to book on their own hotel direct sites.  This undermines the integrity of the rating system.        	                2	5	Thursday	expedia	neutral
2094	            I made a motel resevation thrugh Expedia and was given a rate of $80 non-refundable rate over the phone. When asked why the rates were $10 higher than the previous week I was told the motel had only 2 rooms left and that the rates increase has the occupancy increases. Upon arriving at the motel I found that the rate was actually $65 and the motel was one third full. Expedia lied to me.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	neutral
2095	            They wrongly suggested to me two flights with 35 min difference between them, in different terminals which i booked and paid. Trying to contact them to change it, they only give 1 single US number to telephone. I had to pay this call in order to wait for 18 minutes without any human answer, other than a recording and rock music. I had to hang up and this is what the session was designed to achieve.Is it not funny that everything is automated to extract your payment, and then the system isolates you? ... and you even have to pay for not receiving their answer?        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative
2096	            7 months of talking and planing a Las Vegas trip with Expedia. Four were to go but only three got to leave.We have a special needs daughter .Who uses a power  wheelchair and is on a vent for breathing We did every thing we could to make sure there was no issues Telling The travel agent our daughter is on a  vent and has a power wheelchair that weight  400lb's and is powered by two 12 volt battery  along with one battery to run her Vent. I asked the travel agent about the batteries for the vent and was given specific guild lines that turned out to be incorrect. Our daughter  even went to the travel agent so they could see her Wheelchair so they knew what we were talking about when we said Power Wheelchair and vent . 1st problem and something that alarmed us was when the agent called one day before her trip to confirm pick up in Las Vegas and said the shuttle will pick up our daughter's when they get to Las Vegas airport I said ok so there will be a wheelchair van for her. She then says no its a regular taxi van and we can fold her chair and put it in the back of the cab.Once again we tell her it's a 400 lb's Power Wheel Chair and it dose not fold . She says sorry and that we should phone Las Vegas airport to let them know it's a 400lb's Power Wheelchair . I tell her NO that is something that she needs to do not me . She then agrees to phone Las Vegas and get back to us. Well no call from her on the day of the trip. So we think all is well ..Only to find out when we all get to the airport the air carrier who they are to travel with has no idea about our daughters equipment such as a power wheelchair and a vent to breath and that they both use 12 volt battery. The airline did not receive any  information regarding the vent, wheelchair, and batteries. We try calling the agent only to find out she has now gone on Vacation.I leave a very detailed voice mail of what is going on at the airport. A different agent called and she stated that it wasn't their fault that our daughter could not get on the plane its the airline that refused for her to go on the plane. The airline made it very clear that they were unaware of our daughters special needs and were not prepared for her. In fact she showed us on the terminal screen that our daughters name was there and was scheduled to be on that flight yet there was nothing indicating the Power Wheelchair or the fact that she uses a vent to breath . So now our daughter is back home no trip and a lot of money out of pocket gone to nothing . Hotel , airfare,  show's already booked and paid a cell phone plan .        	                1	1	Friday	expedia	negative
2097	            I booked a trip with expedia... I was taking my yearly vacation... I Booked a trip and as I was printing out the itinerary I found out the lady who booked it made a mistake with the date and had the return flight a day early (where I will be on a cruise on that day) so I called to fix it and and told me to switch flights I need to pay an extra $1,400, (which is more than I paid for the whole trip!) and that  they cant prove what date my trip was because they didnt bother recording that phone call!!!        	                2	1	Tuesday	expedia	neutral
2098	            Minutes after booking this trip I called the hotel directly and asked if they sold discounted tickets to Silverwood Theme Park.  They transferred me to the reservations department to order tickets and while I was on the phone with them I asked what their room rates were to double check that I got the best rate from your website.  They offered me the same room/dates/package for $60 less.  I immediately called Expedia and waited on hold for over an hour to talk to someone.  After an hour and ½ on the phone a gentlemen told me that they were going to credit me the difference and give me a $50 travel voucher.  Due to the lengh of time spent on hold I was running late for work and asked the operator servicing my call to please call me back in the event that my cell phone dropped which he promised he would do.  Sure enough my cell phone dropped the call on my way into work (which I was now 45 minutes late for) and he never called me back.  After work I called Expedia again to correct the situation, waited on hold for over an hour again and was told by the next operator that they couldn’t verify the first call I made, and the rate for the hotel was no longer available so they couldn’t credit my account.  THAN he further insulted me by stating that I should call Expedia to make reservations since I don’t understand how to book hotels online.  I asked to be transferred to a manager or supervisor and have been sitting on hold for the last hour and am killing time by writting this review in hopes that it saves someone else the headache of booking with this horrible company!  So today I’ve been charged over $60 more than I would have been if I would have just booked with the hotel, I’ve lost an hour of pay for being late to work from sitting on hold, and have gone over on my cell phone minutes plan in the 3 hours that I’ve waited on hold, and still nothing has been done to correct this situation!!!  I will never use Expedia again.  This is horrible customer service!!        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
2099	            We booked 3 rooms at a hotel for two nights agu 2ed and 3ed through expedia. Then I called on agu 2ed to cancel the first night as the flight was delayed for a whole day and they told me they would refund. On 3ed, I received a phone call from expedia asking me what was going with our reservations. I told them we canceled the reservation and the agent told me there is no document showing that. After asking me to hold for 30 minutes, she finally found something and believed that we cancelled the first night. But I was told that I can only get the refund after we checked out. We stayed at the hotel for the Aug 3ed. But at the reception, we decided not to use one room and cancelled the room at the reception of the hotel. on Aug 4th, I called expedia, after one-hour phone call, I got the refund for the agu 2ed reservation of one room and waiting for refund for the agu 2ed reservation of the other two rooms. As to the cancellation at the reception of one room, they told me they would confirm with hotel that we did not use that room and then refund me. After waiting for couple days, on Agu 7th  I called expedia again and ask why I did not receive the refund for the agu 2ed reservation of the rest of two rooms. I was told they need a week to process that (btw, why???). After I asked how about the refund for  Aug 3ed of the room we cancelled at the reception. The agent has no idea what I was talking. Then she called the hotel and said hotel has a policy that not to refund. I don't know whom to blame. If this is true, the hotel should tell us as we cancelled at the reception. Otherwise, expedia is dong something. Long story short, I called three times and each time spend one hour on the phone. The agents do not communicate well. You thought you settled with one agent, then the second agent has not idea what the first agent has settled. I don't understand why it takes so long to receive the refund. If I buy something with my card and I returned it to the store, I get the refund immediately. Why does expedia charge my card so quickly then so slow to refund.  Anyways, too much trouble with expedia, much easier to book directly from the hotel. And using expedia is not any cheaper.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

Their bad, they just informed me of the change I had made with the customer service rep minutes before (?).    Then I get another ""emergency"" email.

I've never had a bad experience when I book through Expedia, on the contrary it's very easy and they keep me updated with emails.What they need to improve is:- Allow to have flexible dates searches, they currently only have it for US popular destinations- Perform searches according to destination type or ""everywhere"" on given dates        "	                13	4	Wednesday	expedia	positive
2106	            I am a hotel owner and an avid traveler.  Booking with Expedia, Orbitz ect is the worst thing you can do.  Book directly with the hotel.  Use expedia to find your price and hotel but book direct.  When problems occur, it is much easier to deal with the hotel than to be put on hold for an hour with expedia.  Last year I booked a room using Expedia in January for October.  In June I received a call from the hotel I booked saying they were not going to honor the rate.  I called expedia and they said there was nothing they could do.  I had already booked my flights and the only rooms I could find were three times the price.  What consumers do not know is that hotels pay expedia about 20% for every booking.  That being said the hotel have less flexibility when problems occur.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	negative
2107	            Costly mistake on my part.  I trusted Expedia would help me out by finding the best option for me.  I had inadvertently scheduled my return flight for p.m. instead of a.m.  I called the day before returning home to see what could be done.  The first rep said the only a.m. flight available was at 10:30 and there would be over $1000 charge to change it.  I questioned and re-questioned the rep as I knew Delta had earlier flights to its hub, Atlanta.  He then switched me to another rep and amazingly she found a 5:45 and 6:45 flight.  The extra charge for me was now, $374.  I asked if there was anything else I could do - switch airlines, anything but she said no.  I paid the money.  Upon returning home I called Delta.  I was told I could have had a same day, stand by mode for a $50 charge, that is all. So I ended up overpaiding $324.  I made a complaint with Expedia and I am done with them.        	                1	1	Wednesday	expedia	neutral
2108	"            My husband and I decided to book a hotel a few days ago. I could tell that I was talking to a foreign call center.. I think India.During booking on phone, the lady said that If I needed to cancel my reservation to do so before July 3, 2012 (she meant Aug 3.. July 3 has obviously passed this was know the 3rd time I corrected her on the date) if I canceled before Aug3, there would be no penalty. Well, the next day my daughter caught a nasty bug.. so we decided to cancel our reservation. When I called to cancel, I got a man this time but seems from same out of country. He put me on hold and said that he was going to call the hotel. He came back on the phone, and said that the hotel was not answering and to try and call back. He did say that the hotels policy is that they can cancel without penalty if the cancellation is due to a medical condition or something unforeseen.  So I thought well.. great! Well, I called back on Monday (today) to cancel, since he couldn't get a hold of the hotel manager yesterday. I told the lady that I had called a day prior to cancel, and explained the above to her. She put me on hold to call the hotel. She came back on after several minutes, and said that the hotel could not cancel because I would have had to call before July 3,2012. I corrected this lady too..WE ARE PASSED JULY 3... DO YOU MEAN AUG 3? She said .. oh sorry.. I mean Aug 3. I said, It's July 30th, not passed the 3rd yet. She said, yes I know.. but you needed to cancel before 7 days of your check in time.. I SAID..I AM CALLING 4 DAYS BEFORE NOT ON THE 8TH DAY! I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. I was told when I made my reservation that I would have to call and cancel before Aug 3 to avoid any penalties.. she said ""who told you that"" I said your call center told me that! I have it written down as I was being given the information! She said that the hotel could not cancel, and the the money already charged on my card is non refundable. I WAS FURIOUS!  I told the lady.. I am going to call the hotel myself.  I called the hotel, and I was friendly and courteous.. and I told the lady the situation.. that I needed to cancel due to my daughters illness, and she said that I would need to cancel through Expedia, and that the money was non refundable. I told her that NO WHERE ON THEIR WEBSITE OR EXPEDIA'S, OR THE PERSON TAKING MY RESERVATION TELL ME THERE WAS A NON REFUNDABLE FEE. I was told there would be no penalty, and especially since this was an unforeseen illness. She said that I would have to take it up with Expedia.  SO I thought to myself.. no .. I am going to take it up with my bank..stop the transaction. Luckily.. my bank is able to kick out the transaction as soon as it goes into ""processing"" THANK GOD! So now I am going to call Expedia back and make sure they cancel my reservation.. I don't even want to discuss money.. that is already resolved. They are not going to get one dime from me not ever.

I had to beg for a refund (put on hold for a long time) and then was told that they would rebook a flight BUT the prices would be way HIGHER because I had booked WEEKS ago!  Well, that was the point!  I booked weeks ago at the lowest price and didn't expect them to just cancel and leave me hanging.  They should have offered to rebook a flight with the same time frame AND they should have absorbed the additional cost.  Don't deal with these people.

Is it real, are you really really sure??"".Expedia is supposed to reply emails within 24 hours.I get an email like 29 hours later telling me to call them basically.But I do not think that they have any live answaring service.At least it was 5 pretty good songs turning arround for two hours.If they do have an actual customer service answaring the phone, they should giving some informations like ""Your call will be answaring as soon as possible: expecting waiting time is... 4 hours."".So stressfull experience, never again.

2113	            The price “guarantee” is a complete scam. I will NEVER use Expedia again! I would recommend anyone to stick with Priceline. We went traveling through Yellowstone and booked two separate hotel rooms in two different cities; one through Expedia and one thorough Priceline. I booked hotels rooms a week before our arrival through both. When I arrived at both hotels (White Water Inn in Montana and the other was Hot Springs Inn in Wyoming), they both were actually charging less than what I had booked the rooms for. Of course Expedia had already charged me and now they refuse to match the price that the hotel actually charges. So I paid more to Expedia to stay at the hotel than if I had just booked directly through the hotel itself. The second hotel also charged less but the way Priceline works, you just pay the hotel directly so I was only charged for actually what the hotel charges. I would really recommend avoiding Expedia; apparently there is no reason to even use this company.        	                1	1	Tuesday	expedia	negative

2115	            The following is a letter I sent after my experience, and never received a response from them. Dear Mrs/Mr,I had purchased a hotel reservation from expedia.ca as a christmas present for my girlfriend hoping our experience would be flawless and wonderful. Unfortunately, we realized on January 2nd that the date we had made reservations for was inconvenient for the both of us so we called expedia (english) and changed our 2-night reservation check in date from 19/01/12 to 02/02/12. This took me one hour!The agent must have made a mistake because he changed the reservation date to 02/01/12 instead!!!I called expedia to fix this mistake yesterday and spoke to an agent whom was completely incomprehensible! I know that you guys outsource your call centres but please have some consideration for your costumers.I called expedia back shortly, this time entering through your french call centre to see if I could better communicate in french. I was on the phone for one hour waiting for Mahmoud (#2837) so that he could verify the mistake and help me. Why did it take so long to verify the mistake? Shouldn't it be clear enough, considering the call for a reservation-date-change was made on the day of the call (i called on Jan 2nd and the change was made for Jan 2nd)! How is it even possible?After Mahmoud admit they had made the mistake, he asked me to call back this morning to verify if I would get my money back, or if they will be able to reschedule my reservation.Frankly I want nothing to do with you company anymore, I feel that I deserve much more than this. I have been a great customer for you guys, purchasing several hotel reservations and flights over the years for both myself, family and friends and expect to not do so anymore!Bad news has a tendency to spread much faster than good and I do not intend to let this go lightly.....

Upon arrival and check in, we realized that the hotel was not at all it what we believed it to be.    Filthy, small room, no window , very run down.    Needless to say, we checked out 5 min later.  We called expedia to explain the situation.  We were told that yhere is no refund and we will be responsible for this room.  We asked to please book us a room at another hotel and that we would still use tjeir service.    They refused.    I just can't rap my finger around why they would not refund the money and book us a new room.  We were transferred from 1 associate to another at least 3 times and Disconnected twice after long holds.    Do not use expedia.

On the strength of that, I gave my parents their money back.  After waiting 11 weeks not for the refund, and after emailing them for the 17th time to find out what is going on, I just received an email saying they are only refunding a quarter of what they quoted.  Now I certainly can't go to my parents and say they owe me hundreds of pounds ..... I can't afford to carry the cost as my husband is battling cancer and doesn't work.  I have two jobs to try and make ends meet.  Do you think Expedia care?????NO!!!!!!!!!I am so angry and frustrated by this company but there doesn't seem to be anyone who will take responsibility for this.  So many bad reviews but they continue to rip us off.  Is there a governing body that can look into this?:'o(I have forwarded my complaint to an ombudsman and a travel watch organisation, so fingers crossed they can help.        	                6	1	Friday	expedia	negative
2118	            Expedia has the worst service I have ever experienced. I was due to fly out from London Heathrow at the time they were affected by the snow. Heathrow were advising people not to travel to the airport howeer expedia had a different option and seemed to be the last to know that flights have indeed been cancelled. Tried to check in online at 2pm at which point I was informed my flight had been cancelled however expedia only acknowledged this at 10pm after a number of very lengthly phone calls. For the small saving use another operator which will provide better service.        	                2	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
2119	            The customer service of Expedia is terrible! If you run into problems they will not help you at all.  After 5 hours on the phone talking to 5 different people, all I got was the phone number for the airline's customer service people! I have traveled using Expedia several times before.  This was the 1st time I needed to use their 1-800 number. My flight was canceled due to weather.  I called their number to find a solution. The agent on the other end told me that they would cancel my ticket if I found another flight. I found another flight and called back.  After waiting on hold with the agent for 2 hours, I was told that, because of the inclement weather, I needed to call back the next day before noon. I double checked to make sure that this would not be too late to cancel, but was assured that it would be fine. However, the next morning when I called at 6 am, I was told that it was too late and that my original flight had been re scheduled. I was on the phone with the person for 1/2 an hour explaining things before my new flight took off and I had to hang up. Once I was back in cell service, I called the number again. This time I was told their system was down and that I would have to call them back in 2 hours.  When I called them back I was on the phone again for another 2 hours until I was finally told that at no time could they have canceled the flight and that I should have contacted the airline directly right away!  When I pointed out that I had talked to 4 other people and none of them communicated this to me, I was told that they were sincerely sorry and that the people would be dealt with, but that there was still nothing they could do for me! I will never use Expedia for another flight. With all of the options out there, you can do better than this site.        	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	positive
2120	            I booked my trip to Ireland 4 months in advance using Expedia.  This included a car rental in Dublin with a company called “Payless”.  Because we booked early, we got a good rate.  Apparently too good, because when we got to Dublin, we couldn’t find a “Payless” counter anywhere.  We spoke with several airport employees who said that there was no company called Payless in the airport.  Turns out that it was under a different name (doing business as Dooley Car Rentals).  Nowhere on the Expedia printed itinerary was this listed, nor was it in the itinerary you can have e-mailed to you.  The U.S. number listed on the itinerary was not helpful either due to the time zone change (voicemail).  We had no choice but to rent a car for 5 times the amount at another rental counter.  When we got back to the states, my husband called Expedia to explain our situation.  After over an hour on the phone, we were of course told that it was our fault, because way at the bottom of the booking page on Expedia (not in the print version) buried in a bunch of other links was a link that said ‘Detailed Rental Information’, and that it was our responsibility to click these links and either print them out or remember that it is called Dooley Car Rentals during the 4 months between the time we booked and our trip.  With this type of customer service, we will never use Expedia again, since there may be other times where they are ‘hiding’ CRITICAL information deep in the fine print.        	                1	1	Thursday	expedia	negative
2121	            I booked a motel in Cape Cod,MA for one night through expedia. When I reached the place there was no one at the front desk and I found out that the Motel had been shut for months because it did not have a license to run! Also, it was dirty and disgusting to look at, not worth more than $50 per night and I had paid $150 to Expedia fo rthis shit hole!It was a busy weekend and I spent the next 3 hrs looking for a place to stay. So I went to the Cape for an overnigth trip and the night got ruined because by the time I found a place, everything had closed... not even dinner! So basically Expedia does not have any stock of the places they offer to people and they charge crazy prices for shitty places.        	                1	1	Monday	expedia	negative
2122	"            The only appropriate ""star rating"" for Expedia would be not a star, but a black hole.  The main problem is that the customer service phone staff seem to be making up information as they go along.  Over the course of these multiple phone calls, I received a plethora of different answers as to why I could not access the offer I was trying to get, most of which contradicted each other or the text of the offer itself.  Here is a summary of the explanations I received over the course of these numerous phone calls: •	“This offer has expired.”  (Me:  “but it says it doesn’t expire until July 31.”  Agent:  “We haven’t updated our web page yet.”)•	“The hotel has decided to discontinue this offer.” •	Expedia has decided to discontinue this offer.”•	“I don’t see any such offer anywhere on our site.” (Two different agents told me this.)•	“You have to cancel your hotel reservation and re-book it again for a later date.•	“You have to book this offer at the same time you make your hotel reservation – it cannot be booked separately.”•	“You can get this offer by visiting the ‘Activities’ tab, it does not have to be booked in conjunction with a hotel.” •	“You have to use the offer on the same date as your hotel check-in date.”•	“This offer is only available with a two-day advance purchase.” •	“This offer is only available with a five-day advance purchase.”•	“There is no reason why you should not be eligible for this offer, and I will transfer you to customer service.”  (I was then disconnected after a 20-minute hold.)•	“You are not eligible for this offer. Their customer service is a bad joke, totally unknowledgable, and created numerous problems on my trip.        "	                1	1	Saturday	expedia	negative
