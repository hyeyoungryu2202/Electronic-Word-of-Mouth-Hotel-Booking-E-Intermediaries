When I cancelled the booking the hotel claimed they returned my deposit but it has not been returned. I sent all me credit card statements to booking. com to prove they had taken my deposit and not returned it and got no satisfaction.

3	"            Only used them once and very dissapointed. I logged a complaint that the company I booked a room with  'express-o-rooms' not only would not allow me in the room at 9pm! stating it 'was not finished' and to come back later but I was sent to a different address to the one stated on booking.coms site but I was eventually put up in a converted garage!Booking made lots of noises of sympathy saying they would send me an email address so I could attach photos etc. The only thing they sent was an email saying I was ""given a room outside of the house"". Yes a Bloody garage. Totally ignored all the other points and end of the matter as far as they were concerned. Only interested in making money and NOT willing to realistically follow up the other numerous complains and false advertising on thier website made about 'express-o-rooms'.

5	"            We booked milford sound trip from booking.co.nz.We started our trip but my daughter got sick on the way and have to go back immediately from te anau  by different transport . We requested refund as we neither did milfrd sound trip nor taken return from the same company and paid separately to another company transport for return. We contacted tour company ""Milford Select"" for refund and they denied to pay as it was booked from third party ""booking.co.nz"".When we contacted ""booking.co.nz"" they clearly said no to refund . Felt cheated and annoyed to see these things happened in the first world countries.Anyways , my 2 cents, if you want to book a trip , book directly with the tour company not with any booking.co.nz type websites which doesnt gave any guarantee. They dont worth it .        "	                1	1	Saturday	booking	negative

Booking.com said they needed to contact the hotel (Best Western London Queens Crystal Palace) but when i contacted the hotel directly they said it was up to booking.com.

9	            I'm surprised with seeing booking.com having such low rating, I used their website for many years and it have never disappointed. I love that they have a much more extensive filtering option, while still lacking some options, provide more flexibility and easier search criterias than some of the other sites I also used. It's no surprise that the most vocal people are the ones disappointed, and as such, ratings will always be skewed towards the negative spectrum. This includes me. In trying to improve on that, I hope people would also post their positive experiences, and not just their bad ones.        	                7	5	Thursday	booking	positive

Currently in Sydney I got a room inhabited by cockroaches and other bugs you do not want to share a room with and it was terribly loud until 3am.

12	            I have had the worst experience of something I thought would take 10 minutes to resolve but after weeks of trying still has not been resolved . I was browsing through my bank statement and noticed £734 had been debited out if there and needless to say I was confused as I had not booked a personal hotel for months. After some investigation it turns out that instead of debiting my company's card for a booking I was doing for a client they had taken the money off one of my stored personal cards instead. On contacted them and going backwards and forwards for weeks. Including me trying to pay on a different card. They are refusing to swap teh payments around . So effectively they have stolen £734 off me and are refusing to give it back. I am not really sure what to do.Avoid the company like the plague if you are going to have any customer service or paymnet issues because they are surely not going to be.        	                3	1	Wednesday	booking	negative
13	"            Booking.com - Avoid at all costs. Used Booking.com to find accommodation for 29/11/19 on Sunday 2/12/18 (Almost a full year in advance). I searched on booking.com specifying I only wanted no cancellation charges and no prepayment charges. Booked a room for one party 2 A &amp; 1 C thinking it was what I requested no cancellation and no prepayment charges. Went to book the other room for our party 2A &amp; 2C - no rooms available they do not accommodate families.Never mind, cancel that booking and book us all into a different hotel. No, not an option - our party will now be separated in different hotels in Edinburgh because Jurys Inn will not let Booking.com cancel my booking without charging me the full rate even though the booking is 29/11/19 - almost a full year away! Jurys Inn replied t my query saying Booking.com had to reply.  Booking.Com replied saying Jurys Inn wont remove the cancellation charge!Who do you believe?!I advised Booking.com I didn't think it was acceptable that their website brought up all other room options even though I specified ""No Cancellation Fee"" and ""No Prepayment"". I was just told yes it does that.  Very misleading!        "	                3	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

When I found out the day of my reservation, they suggested I book a new one (I'm now on the way from the airport). After complaining, they said they would call me back with suggestions. No call back. They sent an email with alternatives that were really far from my original booking, and totally unacceptable quality (it was a work trip). I finally got one of them to say they would reimbursement for the difference if I rebooked at a similar place. Even still, I booked a worse hotel, far away, for more money. Following the booking they refused to pay the difference, and claimed that there was nothing they could do. When I asked for an explanation, they said they couldn't give me one, as it is ""Sensitive Information"". When I informed them that I recorded all conversations, they got very quite. No supervisor or manager available. This is a HORRIBLE company, with no ethics. They repeatedly admitted they were in the wrong, but there was nothing they could do, and furthermore no information could be given due to ""sensitive information"". DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!

I then rang Rideways in UK and he had no answer from Pratransfers so just told me I had to book a new taxi myself or I would miss my flight! Asked the apartment staff in Prague to help me and booked a new taxi using Uber which was cheaper FYI and then ran through the airport and just made our flight. Rideways offered a refund and 10% off our next trip which is a joke as I will never use this company again the stress was to much. Also to note the taxi that picked us up from the airport which was also booked through Rideways was just an unmarked white Astra all very dodgy to me.

17	            Extremely unhelpful with a situation I was stuck in. This person I was on the phone to had no idea what my situation was about after explaining to him several times what exactly it was about and then wasn't understanding at all as well as giving me false information. This resulted in him hanging up the phone due to his frustration. He had no clue whatsoever. I then called up again and explained my situation to a woman who sounded like she had little customer service experience. She then put me on hold for a moment and hung up. Finally I spoke to someone who clearly had a lot of experience and once he explained everything clearly I was able to move forward with the problem.

19	            Booking.com sends out wrong receipts with multiplied prices...: Tried to book on ‘Booking.com’ a non refundable stat: total price 950 pounds. 2 seconds after having payed a receipt pops up on the screen: ‘Thank You for buying for 7800 Pounds. Enjoy..’ Totally chocked we of course cancelled this 6 seconds after payment and tried to call Booking.com instantly. Very difficult to reach them but finally we were connected to someone long distance.. The woman tells us that we will have to pay because it’s a non refundable stay and that she (Booking.com) tells me that there can be no fault in their app/software..?!. Booking.com makes no errors, and we will have to pay if the hotel does not agree on cancelling…! We have to beg her cancelling this crazy transaction – also with the hotel - but she is very unwilling to do this. At this time we don’t know if the bill will be 950 or 7800 pounds and therefore calls our bank to kill the account…After several nervous hours we find out that the reservation seemed to be ok for 950 pounds but that Booking.com must have generated an instant receipt with an IT bug that took the price in Danish Kr. 7800 and converted this in to D.kr. as if it had been Pounds… Big mistake and not pleasant to see seconds after a finished transaction on 950 and not 7800 Pounds..! Do they or do they not take 7800 Pounds from us..?Of course we cancelled very quickly and why on earth Booking.com does not help us out of this payment is a mystery.! They displayed a very wrong receipt…! We had to call and write to the hotel and our bank to get the tremendous bill cancelled for hours, even though we instantly reacted calling Booking.com. They have a bug somewhere in their algorithm sending out instant bad receipts on the screen…!

22	"            I booked a hotel room in Geneva for a girls trip this November. Booking.com cancelled my reservation without telling me and when I arrived we had no reservation and I had to pay an extra $300 to rebook the room. When I called Booking.com they said they cancelled the room and emailed me about it. They did not (I checked my email, spam folder, and trash) and I kept getting reminders from Booking.com and something called TripIt (a 3rd party Booking.com sold my information to) reminding me of my reservation (including on the check-in date). I also asked to be sent a copy of the cancellation email and they were unable to do this, presumably because it does not exist. They even had the audacity to send ""How was your trip?"" emails following my trip even though it was supposedly cancelled!Lastly, they're customer service people sounded like robots and recited some sort of prepared speech at me when I called (presumably since this sort of thing happens all the time). Terrible customer service and extremely shady and dishonest business practices. NEVER using them again and telling everyone I know.        "	                1	1	Saturday	booking	negative

24	            Best thing to do with this rubbish site is use it to find what you want and then cut them out of the loop by contacting the hotel directly. Then they don’t get commission &amp; often the customer gets benefit of a lower price. Cut out the middle man. RIP off outfit. The big letters on the start of page on their site say free cancellation on most rooms. And when it’s booked tells you that. I only used that site as trying to find a babysitter &amp; couldn’t. So, to be nice to the hotel, so they could re sell the room,  I went on and tried to cancel. One day after booking &amp; the day before my proposed stay. Guess what? That was only until midnight the day it was booked. So full fee. Their utterly pathetic website then says you can request a free cancellation otherwise it’s full price. And then you will get a response in 48 hours The booking was for the next day. Way to take your hard earned cash with their commission. When I called and spoke directly to the really pleasant hotel staff member she sorted it out for me. So I’ll use that hotel again &amp; never book through this lot again.        	                2	1	Friday	booking	positive

27	            Rented an apartment in Dublin for my wife daughter and myself.On arrival we were allocated an outside basement flat.We initially said no way, however were reassured by the receptionist that there was 24 hr security. On arrival back after a meal around midnight, we were met with a vagrant/ drug addict/ homeless person sleeping across our doorway. We made our way past, called the provided numbers for help but no one answered. For our safety we moved out and walked the streets of Dublin to obtain a hotel room. To date neither the owners or booking.com have apologised or acknowledged our calls or emails, other than to state, no compensation, we can no longer help! We were very fearful as the main door was made of a single glass frame, easily broken.

There was no instruction that pools are closed during my trip. We've wanted to have a nice break in the pool but pool was actually closed. When I requested refund so I could change the hotel, cs lady told me it was written on the website that pool would be closed and it is not their problem. I remembered I double checked the description so I said so, but she was so rude saying 'no it was there and they always close pool during winter' And then I checked and screenshot every pages on that hotel and there is no crystal clear description that pools would be closed during that time, and only I found one short note that pools are closed in cool month AFTER CLICKING AND GO OVER NUMEROUS PAGES. Of course, no indication about what month is cool month. What kind of service is this? I believe cs is there to help customers or at least pretend they care about customers, but they are there just to keep your money safe, just sack them and go for automated response. That's gonna save you a lot of money than losing customers. Well played booking.com and good luck with my money. Thank you for ruining our thanksgiving holidays. And again, your CS SUCKS.

Initially, Booking.com were really helpful getting us alternative accommodation,  but since then it's been down hill. Everytime i speak to someone in customer service they give me false promises, which invariably are broken soon after, causing me to call back and start again.

The main security door with a ""PIN"" code was broken and anyone could have entered the building. The Apartment was never cleaned and dirty. So much so, that we left the same night and stayed somewhere else. I made a written complaint to the Hostmaker and booking.com sending them Pictures as proofs.What I got back were apologetic replies. Booking.com even wrote that they have contacted the third Party to reimburse a very small amount back and that within 14 days, I should get it. And if I do not receive it, ""I"" have to contact my bank. Why on earth for should I contact my bank? It just does not make any sense at all.So, 1 month passed by, nothing happened.What I do not understand is this - why promise something when nothing will be done? Is this the ethics of this Company? Just reply and throw the case in the rubbish?

He called me back about 2 hours later confirming the hotel could not swap the dates as they were fully booked however they cancelled the booking free of charge.

Their client is the guest house, not the traveller, and their customer support is atrocious and without power to do anything but offer generic responses until you lose interest in the matter. This booking system is clearly manipulative and designed to make you book, not designed to help you find the best place to stay, and good luck getting a senior person to respond to and resolve matters - even when guest safety is concerned.        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	positive

36	            Firstly, I am a frequent traveller and user of this provider (but no more!!). I booked accommodation with this organisation.  The apartment was advertised, went through paid and on the landing screen then highlighted 'important information'.  The important information that was not apparent whilst booking was you would be required to transfer to the owners bank account £200 security deposit - the cost of my stay was £198 which I had already paid.  I promptly cancelled the booking in less than 4 minutes from booking it.  I was then told that cancelling the booking I was required to pay the £198!  So in the sales process Booking.com misrepresented the contract terms but they then hid behind policy to tell me NO refund.  I contacted their customer services to be told it was their policy.

40	            Long story short, don't expect any support from Booking.com if something goes wrong on your booking, they will send you an automatic answer re-directing to the hotel. I ask myself, why should I book a room through booking if there is no support at all?The right thing to do is to check the best prices in booking.com and then book straight with the hotel, do not use Booking.com, it's a scam.Now my story:Two months ago I have booked a room through booking.com and booking charged me immediately 80 euros for the booking. When I arrived at the hotel I mentioned that the room was already paid. The receptionist rejected and made me pay again for the room. Without alternative and being in a foreign country I had no alternative other than pay again.Since then I have been struggling to have an answer from Booking.com. They keep asking me for detailed such as the booking number and pin and hotel name as if they don't have access to all this information. Basically, booking.com re-directs you to the hotel and does nothing. No answers for weeks both from the hotel and booking.com. I ask myself: it's a great business, they get a commission on every booking and if something goes wrong it's your problem.Booking.com is rubbish.        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

Arriving at the hotel, which in the meantime was fully booked, I found out that they contacted Booking.com yesterday regarding the credit card issue. But did I hear anything from Booking.com? Not at all! They simply just cancelled my booking without any further notice. It resulted in a 20 euro more expensive night at another hotel. I will definitely find another way to book future accomodation.        	                2	1	Tuesday	booking	neutral
42	            I recently stayed in York, booked through booking.com.The b&amp;b (diamond villas york) was rated 3* but in my opinion was more like a 1*.For £277.74 we were placed on the 3rd floor, no ensuite, shared toilet (No hand wash faciliteis) and shower room (tiny). Nowhere to hang/store clothes, tv didn't work, door to toilet kept me awake when others went in. Also we were room only for this money.        	                2	4	Tuesday	booking	positive

50	            This is to share my experience with booking.com recent experience. Anyone going to Cyprus and looking for apartment please avoid Luxury Holiday Suite Larnaka. This place is either a scam and reviews too or 3 of us were very unfortunate not to be able to find it. Arrived at the stated location at 1pm and were looking for the place for 3 hours and also with the help of locals and Google maps and we couldn't find it. But worse of that the phone number of owner was not reachable. After 3 hours called booking.com and took maybe 20 mins to get through to speak to someone. After explaining the situation they said they will check themselves and haven't came back to me. So after an hour same procedure and same out come. And another hour passed and same outcome and it was around 8:30 pm when they offered alternative apartment which was an embarrassment to even settle any people in it so I refused. Luckily I've turned out of desperation to Airbnb - quickly signed up with them and by 9:30 pm we were in a lovely apartment. This is £230 booking.com will never see! I've just checked and I've been using booking for more than 10 years both for business and for leisure. And this was the last time I use them!        	                3	1	Sunday	booking	negative
51	            never using booking.com again, booked a villa with them &amp; told final cost would be £994, transferred money with bank transfer as instructed &amp; then told by villa we still owe them 44.91 euro, 43.91 euros I'm assuming was there exchange rate but if I paid in euros would have only been a difference of 5 euro. the other 15 euro was the rental company's bank charges which we by European law do not pay as from 13/1/18. contacted booking.com &amp; their advice was to pay the extra in case we lose the villa, they are not interested.....be careful what booking.com tell you your final cost may not be your final cost then wash their hands of you.        	                3	1	Sunday	booking	negative

53	"            Made a booking through Booking.com. in the center of Milano. When we arrived Saturday in Milano, there was NO hotel - The ""hotel"" was apparently all fake. The suite we booked, through Booking.com didn't even exist. We called Booking for help, and fairly quick they booked a new hotel for us. A hotel 15 km outside of Milano in a small town. Fair enough. Not great though. It did cost us 50 euros to get there.When we arrived at this new hotel, we had to pay AGAIN. Another 175 euros. So this booking adventure has now doubled our expenses. We would LIKE Booking to contact us again, so they can refund their mistake. But we havn´t heard from them for a week now. If booking don´t give us back what is ours I will never, ever recommend booking to anyone I know. We need to feel secure, when we use their site..        "	                3	1	Sunday	booking	neutral
54	            Disgusting customer service and unethical charging credit card practice.Booking.com charged me for a booking basic reservation, and then the hotel charged me directly with my credit card on file.The reservation effectively has been charged twice and booking.com is not providing a refund, THIS IS THEFT.When asked to speak with a  manager or supervisor, I was told that because I received a basic rate, then I am not entitled to speak with anyone at a higher level.I will not book with this company ever again.        	                3	1	Sunday	booking	negative

After a string of very long telephone calls to complain , finally got a small amount back for room overcharge which despite being basic entitlement, they claim this is compensation.

56	"            Ive used booking.com a few times and found them to be OK..Recently however, I tried to cancel a hotel booking due to medical circumstances, which meant i couldnt make the intended trip at fairly short noticeI informed Booking.com 36 hours ahead of check-in and they emailed me to say that they would contact the hotel and see whether they would be willing to forego all/part of the fee I heard nothing back so telephoned them after the booking date. They told me that the hotel had refused to accommodate my request and I would be charged the whole feeI called the hotel directly who told me that they had received no communications from booking.com either to notify them of my intended cancellation (so I was marked as a ""no show""), nor of my subsequent communication requesting an update.  They offered to cancel all fees and identified that booking.com regularly fails to communicate with them in such casesI will book directly in future and cancel my booking.com membership        "	                6	1	Saturday	booking	negative
57	"            We've used booking.com for years and never had any issues with them. Bookings have been made, accommodation has been fine and we've never had to complain about anything.As we've just discovered first hand, the measure of a company is how they behave and act when things go badly. In this respect, booking.com have failed on every possible level.We recently booked a non-smoking apartment in Leicester. It was not cheap (£110 a night) but not priced at the premium end of the market either. When we arrived, it soon became apparent that a) the place was filthy and b) it stank of stale cigarette smoke. There were cigarette burns all over the carpets.The place was also insecure; the ground floor bedroom's external doors opened onto a public facing garden, but it could not be locked. Main thing though was that  I could not stay there under any circs as I'm asthmatic and cigarette smoke is about the worst thing in the world for my chest.We contacted both the owner and booking.com to complain. When the owner initially appeared unsympathetic to our messages, we asked booking.com to find us alternative accommodation. They refused to do anything whatsoever and simply asked us to take pictures (of stale cigarette smoke?!) and file a complaint upon our return, whereupon they'd consider ""compensation"".The owner phoned us after a while and - in a remarkable change of tack - promised us a full refund! So, we booked somewhere else confident we'd not be out of pocket.Upon our return, the owner changed his mind, denied ever offering the full refund and offered us £30 instead. We sent booking.com their requested complaint and a mass of pictures showing cigarette burns and poor cleanliness and in response they did - nothing. Several emails later, they dug their heels in and repeatedly denied all responsibility. They said our claim was with the owner, not them.So we're now pursing a paypal claim to try and get a refund. We're not under any misapprehensions about how that's going to turn out, so know we'll ultimately be faced with taking the owner to the small claims court to get out money back.Morale of the story? If you're happy in the knowledge that booking.com will offer you no backup or assistance if things go wrong with your stay, then keep using them.If, like us, you believe that a booking agent should be accountable for the accuracy of information on their website, the quality of the accommodation they offer and ultimately the honesty and integrity of the landlords who's properties they promote, then don't go within a country mile of this company....and if you do, don't be surprised when you're left high, dry, out of pocket and disappointed.

60	            Booking.com is just terrible as soon as you get issues with a hotel: we had last year a cancellation without any notice - everything nearby was booked out - so we had to sleep in a car!!! Booking.com offered a compensation. After 6 months I stopped calling them to ask for that. Shame on You!Today, same issue - hotel does not accept credit cards even it's written in the payment terms. Booking.com offered to clarify and find a new place...nothing happens.Very poor service. Never again. There are enough alternatives!        	                1	1	Thursday	booking	negative
61	            We had huge safety &amp; hygiene issues with a hostel booked via booking.com (it was in fact unfit for humans - especially so considering 3 young children were involved). I contacted booking.com customer services which were dismissive, unsympathetic and in short, appalling. They refused to do anything without any photographic evidence - which is unreasonable as I wouldn't have photographic evidence of a stranger (turned out to be a staff member, but didn't identify himself as so) barging into our room when we were going to sleep &amp; asking to place another stranger in a room with our children (seriously?!) So no - photographic evidence is a silly &amp; unreasonable request under such circumstances! There were many other issues with the particular hostel also where photographic evidence would not have been possible. I have been left dumbfounded by their lack of customer service. I will NOT BE USING booking.com in future &amp; I will be urging others to do the same. How on earth can booking.com still be trading?!?!?!        	                4	1	Thursday	booking	negative

63	            Do not trust them! We booked a hotel we booked 6 times previously unfortunately they closed for renovations - it had just been taken over by new owners. They sent us an email in Spanish a couple of weeks before - that we thought was spam which was followed by an email welcoming us as normal. So we had no idea there was a problem!We arrived to a closed hotel completely news to us at 9.30 at night in Mexico. Anyway we found a hotel who contacted the new owner who made no effort to help us and we sorted our own accommodation for the rest of the week. We obviously contacted booking.com to complain. They apologized and said they would help us. Following from that they said the single email in Spanish was adequate notice and so they would only pay half of what we paid extra during the week.Not only was our holiday very stressful to turn up in Mexico and be homeless they are seriously saying one email in Spanish was adequate notice for us knowing that the hotel was closed. I don't even know what to say to that - seriously???! Safe to say we do not read or speak Spanish. Also safe to say I will NEVER use booking.com EVER again. I completely understand it's out of booking.coms hands that the new owners did this and only contacted us once but for them to agree this was adequate notice for us is just beyond belief. I can't even begin to understand that.I don't even know what to say...        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	positive
64	            I have used booking.com for years, they have a great selection of hotels and when you have booked a number of times you get good 'genius' offers. Customer care has been helpful several times, at other times they've been impossible. Most hotels have been as described, but others do not offer the services they promise in their information on the site. Booking.com does not act on false information even when they receive proof, and they do not publish critical reviews, which I find unacceptable. Don't trust the information on this site too much and be sure to book with the right to free cancellation.        	                10	3	Wednesday	booking	positive

67	            Hi, When I was in Hong Kong, I had very unsatisfactory experience with Booking.com. I always thought that the places listed on Booking.com are certified and legit places that you can book a room safely and stay there in convenience. However, I was wrong and it seems that booking.com just tries to increase the number of listings and its profits without giving enough time to review the suitability of the places. I booked a place and got there at 10 PM. The guys there were crook and asked me only cash instead of credit card. Half-naked guys were walking in narrow corridors and place was indeed a shithole. I refused to pay in cash as I did not have 700 HKD with me. I left and the guy said he is gonna call Booking.com and charge me. When I called Booking.com, I was surprised that they said they need to take this matter to the property owner and see if he agrees to cancel my reservation for free. They take property owners side most of the times. When I checked the place (called Gorgeous Hotel at 36-44 Nathan Road Chunking mansion) ,I could not find any information online and on Google. Anyway, my conclusion is that do not trust the review and the scores on Booking.com and check the place quality on Google first. See if such place exists online.        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	positive

73	            London Lifestyle Apartments - South Kensington - Museums.😡😡We traveled two adults and five children in the autumn holiday to London.When we arrived at the apartment, the landlord was not yet finished cleaning up after previous tenants. It was no problem, we put our suitcases down and went to the museum that was close to the apartment. When we got back to the apartment, it smelled of tobacco and waste. Several of the furniture was broken and could not be used, the sofas were sticky and smelled bad. Windows could not be closed. The kitchen and kitchen tables were greasy and not particularly delicious. All smoke alarms were covered with plastic bags. As you flushed the toilet, the water ran out onto the bathroom floor, resulting in wet feet.We contacted the landlord who sent a man named Adam. We were told we would get our money back but that they had a house we could rent instead. If we could approve the house, we could rent it for the same price. Then we all drove out to the house, which was 45 minutes from the apartment in taxi. The house did not fit us because the children had to sleep on mattresses on the floor and one of the children had to sleep alone. We therefore rejected the new place. The landlord then jumped into his big Mercedes and drove away. There we stood with five children at. 20.30 in the evening and had to find taxis and a hotel.We have tried to get our money returned as we were promised, but the landlord does not respond to our mails. We rented the apartment at booking.com, which is no guarantee of assistance against the landlord. In spite of more mails, pictures and phone calls, I do not hear anything from Booking.com. The last thing I have received from Booking.com is that it is best that I contact the landlord. Honorable to have lost 12,000 dkr. to such two fraudsters.Stay away from this landlord and Booking.com.        	                4	1	Monday	booking	negative

Instead of apologising they simply implied I was doing something wrong. Finally they admitted there were issues and said they'd refund me the equivalent of the voucher. Still waiting for that refund.

Unless a senior person at booking.com gets back to me with an apology and explanation I will be avoiding. Ps they are still advertising availability at the hotel where there is none. FIX IT.

85	            I had booked a room at a hotel in Dahab. Egypt for 2 nights . On arrival they claimed to have no details of the booking and after waiting an hour they finally checked us in and showed us to a terrible room that even had a resident cat in it! We decided immediately not to stay there and told them why. The staff  told us we still had to pay for the first night which we accepted reluctantly because we just wanted to leave as quickly as possible. I booked a really nice hotel and went on to have a very enjoyable stay .On arriving home  I contacted booking.com and have to say the customer service team were awesome. They even refunded the cost of the room plus a little extra as a goodwill gesture and the money was in my bank in less than 48 hours of me accepting their offer.

Booking.com were superb &amp; even phoned me (albeit while I was still in my pit) to say the owner of the accommodation I was supposed to be residing with was having trouble processing a refund that I paid. However, all sorted via the info given from booking.com, refund in bank &amp; no issues whatsoever. Would use again no probs &amp; thanks!!!        	                15	5	Thursday	booking	neutral

They offered us a third apartment for four times the price of Air B&amp;B ! This trip  was for a very special occasion, and it has caused  such stress , it seems bookings .com are super unreliable , vastly more expensive than others , and once they have your money ,you can’t get it back !        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	neutral

92	            Made a booking 3 months in advance. The confirmation email said that the booking was confirmed and guaranteed. The week we were due at the accommodation provider cancelled due to card information issues. Phoned the accommodation provider a couple hours later and the room had been sold to someone else. Phoned booking.com who said that I should have confirmed the payment directly with the accommodation provider when I made the booking (clearly my fault for not knowing that guaranteed is not actually guaranteed)They then tried to sell me other rooms at extortionate prices because of the late notice. Booking.com did nothing to resolve my issue. My advice is to find your accommodation on the website and book directly with the provider. Booking.com adds no value as a so called travel agent.        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

94	            Had a reservation for 3 rooms in New York that I cancelled with over 1 week to go. The hotel subsequently charged me for all three nights so I contacted Booking.com to get my refund as the only reason I use them is the Cancellation policy. That was 7 weeks ago. I have been passed around from pillar to post to try to get it refunded with each department blaming the other, only after emailing the CEO directly did anything happen and even then I had to do that three times before it was eventually resolved.

95	            I have used Booking.com many times. When trips work out ok, there isn't a problem. However, when there are issues, their customer service is extremely poor. I went on a trip to France in July and had several bookings. Unfortunately one of them was awful. I was offered a tiny bed in a tiny room with no windows. There was very little floor space so I declined to stay. In fact when I returned the key the family were smoking in the hotel too. I booked somewhere else with Booking.com then applied for a refund and sent them a photo of the room. Whilst I received an email saying that I would be refunded, I never have been. The first email was forgotten. I applied again after my holiday and it was as if I had never applied in the first place. I then got an email to say that the owner had agreed a full refund and Booking.com would send it on to me and get the money back from the owner, unless I wanted to claim it from the owner myself (why would l I when I paid Booking.com).It is now November and still no refund. I wrote again and got an email stating I would have to claim directly from the owner, even though I had forwarded the email from them stating that they would pay me. If I was going to deal with the owner directly, I would have booked with them in the first place! The owner doesn't speak English and I speak only tourist French. I haven't used Booking.com since and don't intend to. I have booked a Christmas break through someone else. I will resort to legal action to get my refund. Beware people! You have been warned about Booking.com        	                6	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

97	            The site is completely unclear when booking. It is so interested in telling you that there is only '1 room left' it fails to tell you how many travellers are included within the booking. I turned up at a hotel and they said the room was for 1 person despite there being 3 of us. A previous time they indicated that breakfast was included but it wasn't (at least they refunded us the breakfast costs). For a travel booking system they are completely useless. Avoid at all costs.        	                2	1	Monday	booking	negative
98	            Clearly they do not check the accommodation and allow any standard.Was booked into a “luxury apartment” with my family. Only at bed time did we realise they beds weren’t clean. I had to go buy new sheets and covers as it was too late to find alternative accommodation. Also thought people would leave oven pans, although I can’t imagine they’d have been clean either.Book through a reputable company not this poor excuse of an organisation.        	                4	1	Monday	booking	positive
99	"            So, this happened back in mid-September of this year. 5 minutes before my wife was due to arrive at the hotel she got a text message stating that they had cancelled the booking and that they would refund the money. Not having accommodation was a horrible situation to be put in and put a damper on the whole trip. I've made 9 calls to Booking.com, totaling more than 3 hours, and I still haven't received my refund. Each time I've rung them up I've had to explain the entire situation again, so either they're not making case notes or they're not reading them. I also seem to get put on hold a lot for long periods of time. I've spoken to 9 different customer service reps at Booking.com and 8 of them agreed that Booking.com should and will refund the money. One of those 9 stated that a ""non-refundable"" booking meant that they could cancel the reservation and that I would not be due a refund. I really hope that this isn't the case. I'd always thought that there was some sort of legislation against this sort of thing when the company doesn't supply the goods and services that you've paid them for. Every time I call it seems that I am met with delay tactics. At first, they said that I would be credited with a refund within 5 days. After 5 days I called, and they then told me it would be 48 hours. And after that they said it would be 20 days. I've had to scan my credit card and send it to them and I've also had to enter the details into a credit card refund invitation link. I've tried emailing them, but they seem to have gone completely silent now. It's been 60 days since the trip and I've still not been given the refund that has been promised. I thought it would be safe using booking.com, as they're a big multinational company, but I've been robbed by them. I'd certainly never use them again.  It seems that their strategy is to make it so difficult to get your money back and that you'll just give up and let them keep the money. Judging from reports on other forums this is what has happened to many other people. In summary, please think very seriously indeed before you make any reservations with Booking.com - if you're unlucky then you won't have anywhere to stay when you arrive, and you'll never see your money again. Don't make the same mistake that I did.        "	                1	1	Sunday	booking	positive

103	"            The quality of services provided by Booking.com  has deteriorated sharply in the last couple of years.  I used this company to make the vast majority of my travel reservations for about 4 years - and I travel a lot. Sure, I appreciated the services at first, from photos to reviews and quick confirmations/cancellations.  I used it so often that I was given whatever high status they award the best customers. However, since 2017, Booking.com messed up 4 times. Three of those times involved hearing from desk managers that their hotels had not received any reservation from booking in my name and there were no available rooms.  Travelers know that relying on a hotel reservation that does not exist is a big deal, since arriving at a hotel late in the evening after long hours of travel is very frustrating. It can be unsafe as well, as it often implies getting back on the road feeling tired, late at night, in an unknown area and, occasionally, under inclement weather.  The fourth and last time Booking failed to meet minimal standards of service was when they provided insufficient AND misleading information about a hotel's pet policy. The Booking.com site only stated that ""charges may apply."" I expect pet charges in most hotels, and that's fine. So I made the reservation and was immediately charged, since we'd be arriving that same evening. Upon receiving the confirmation and hotel phone number (Booking only shares the hotel phone number after you complete the reservation), I called the hotel to ask for a room near one of the entrances. As I was about to hang up I thought I'd ask the amount of the pet fee to make sure it wasn't absurdly high. It wasn't, but I was then also informed of a weight limit (like for a pocket dog) and a maximum of 1 dog per room.  Booking had no warning about those restrictions. I asked hotel to then cancel the reservation, since we were already on the road with our 2 dogs and 4 hours away from home. Hotel manager said I had to cancel with Booking.com, since I had made my reservation with them.  I call Booking.com and hear that ""there was nothing they could do"" because both Booking.com and the hotel would suffer a loss due to the ""late cancellation.""  THIS WAS 15 MIN AFTER THE ORIGINAL RESERVATION WAS MADE!! It's not like too many people would have been kept from reserving a room (that same room) during those 15 minutes!!  ""No,"" said Booking again, ""call the hotel."" In sum: Booking.com makes money from our reservations but accepts no accountability if something goes wrong.  After this fourth unpleasant experience, I decided to cancel other  reservations I had with Booking.com for a 3-week vacation around New Year's and a different international business trip later on. Those reservations added up to more than $6,000. So Booking lost my business forever and $6,000+ of confirmed reservations because they did not honor their service, recognized the faulty info provided, and refused to refund a $120 hotel night.I was very happy to see that in the 3 months that followed the dispute, the company's stock lost more than 10 percent of its value.

114	            I booked a room in Germany, through booking.com!! The hotel name is Hof in cologne. The room had free cancellation policy but two days after my reservation they took the money out from my account. And couple days later I received an email saying that my room was cancelled!!! So I called the hotel asking why they cancelled my reservation and charged me as well. He completely denied that they charged me and asked me to rebook another room and they won’t charge me for that, they just said it was a mistake and I trusted them. So again after two days they charged me for the rebooking. So, so far they charged me twice. I contacted booking.com so many times and they told me to send them the bank statement as proof. They kept saying the hotel is saying they haven’t charged me, although they were seeing my bank statement.  After 10 working days the first money was refunded. And meanwhile a chunk of money 10 times more than a room price was taken from my account. Hof took that money. How on earth a hotel can take a money out from an account??? I didn’t get any answers from booking.comHowever the money was refunded and I cancelled my second reservation as well and that took another 15 working days to be resolved.Don’t trust booking.com as they’re working with any dodgy places that they have access to your bank accounts. I reported this to my bank too.Booking.com needs to answer my question! How a hotel had the access to my card details? How did they took the money out? Don’t you call this fraud?

But when you want to cancel your reservation, they would display it in RED "" no refund if you cancel"". Why not on the actual ad next to the property? In bold red, clearly? They say, you should have read T&amp;C before booking. Are those two words "" non refundable"" your T&amp;C? That doesn' t sound right!

I was forced to go there coz I entered my visa data and I was worried I will pay twice if I don't use that booking only to be disappointed and disrespected. When I got there I met the  very rude old man receptionist. I asked him if I can see the room first but did not allowed me and told me that I should pay first. I booked for 3 nights which is 168hkd but asked me for 190hkd with service charge that was not clearly stated in the booking. And also asking me for 100hkd as deposit,I told him i don't have enough cash then he asked for ID, I gave my driver's license.  After paying he then showed me the room, he brought  me to a very untidy, dirty and smelly with Male occupants room, also not properly lighted. I asked him if he can put me to a place with girls,  he said no and if I want I can upgrade to a small single room for 500hkd. I believe that he should have given the guest the right to choose if I want to stay with a coed room or with a same gender room, especially I am a female and traveling solo. I asked him to put me with female borders but he refused and was very rude, I instead of resolving the issue he just want to harass me I  getting an upgrade which is not convenient for me. I asked him to cancel and refund but he refused and talked bad to me and even told me an ""f"" word. I asked for my ID back but he wants to get the receipt of payment but I don't want give it because I want to bring it to the police to complain. He didn't give my ID back, and I went to the police to complain.  The police only help me to get my ID back but couldn't help me to get my money back.It was a very bad experience with this hostel.That place in the chungking mansion was full of decietfull and crooks. The guys infront on the ground floor harassing people passing by, they keep forcing people to get room, they don't understand the word ""no"".

Spoke to the hotel who didn't try and help me sort out what had gone on, disgusting behavior unfortunately I have now heard this is quite a regular thing for the hotels and booking.com to do when they realise someone big is playing in the area!        	                2	1	Monday	booking	negative
128	            Stayed at a villa where the Manager asked to check our passports on arrival but then held onto to one saying it was required by law I tried to get it back during the holiday but they refused, predictably at the end of the holiday they said I owed  more money for services I had not received and refused to return my passport unless I paid. I phoned booking.com primarily to make them aware of this practice to stop other people going through this but got a reply saying I had blackmailed the property by saying I would leave a bad review !!!!!!  And I would not receive compensation , I Never asked for compensation no amount would be enough for having been threatened verbally and having my passport held  so I couldn’t leave the country until I Paid money.  I contacted booking.com to question this practice !!! I had no response to that instead I Was accused of being a blackmailer.        	                1	1	Monday	booking	negative

There was no parking as stated on the listing, the room looked nothing like the photos and was so disgusting I couldn't stay there. Ended up getting a Premier Inn at double the cost.   Sent evidence (photos and videos) to Booking.com and they simply came back and said no refund.  NO explanation at all.  I am taking a claim through the Small Claims Court to recover my money on principle!  Avoid at all costs as their website is inaccurate and their customer service do not deal with the issues raised.        	                5	1	Sunday	booking	negative
131	            Unscrupulous!  Absolute con!! Booked Jacanda B&amp;B for overnight stay 3-4 November, became unwell with a heart condition and contacted them over a month prior to the booking to ask if we could move the booking to another date. Met with an absolute flat refusal for either and they debited my card within minutes. Greedy and unhelpful to say the least.  Also booked as a follow on during the same trip, Langtry Hotel, Bournemouth which should start tomorrow for 3 nights and they too absolutely refused to move the date to the future and insisted that Booking.com were the real culprits as they take the booking fee. I said I would pay the fee if they would either refund the rest of the money or let us move the booking to the future. Neither was acceptable to the hotel.  I will never use booking.com again as this has cost me well in excess of £400 and I have genuine ill health. Nor will I use either hotel again.        	                3	1	Sunday	booking	negative
132	"            Booking.com customer service is by far the worst I have ever experienced. The ethos is to do the absolute minimum to enable them to ""close"" your problem . When you contact them again you get a different agent and then and other and then another. It's impossible to get past this rude front line and nobody will take ownership of a problem or escalate. With persistence and numerous emails and photographs booking .com asked the property to refund me, the property said no. Booking .com answer ""you are on your own, contact them yourself""   Now they wont even answer my emails. I am writing to the CEO[google it] but not holding my breath.

133	            What a scam! They list cleaning fee as far away possible from the price of the rooms, and in such small writing you don't even notice it! Then only after you've paid you realize your room is actually 20% more expensive because only then do they prominently emphasize you have a cleaning fee to pay too. The worst website to book your accommodation on!        	                4	1	Saturday	booking	negative
134	            I used Booking.com many times and I never had a problem. I see other reviews claim the site is fake, well I presume its just a bunch of people who never read cancellation policies and then later complain but it is essentially their fault for being lazy and not actually read the policies before finalizing their reservation. I think the website is great and it gives you a great overview of a variety of properties in the area you're interested in. Beware, they offer different types of accomodation, so you have to use filters on the left side to actually filter out the types you dont need. All in all, they offer price matching and I had a very positive experience with their customer service and got my price matched in one phone call. Also, customer representative was very friendly and helpful.        	                2	5	Friday	booking	positive
135	            Absolute scam of a company with fake accommodation photos and information on their website, as well as non-existing customer service that didn't even try to help us. We booked a hostel in Lisbon for a week and the moment we arrived it was clear that the photos on the website were fake. That's right - the host posted photos on the hostel's page that had nothing to do with how the room really looks like. To make things worse, it wasn't something like different furniture or wall color, it was a whole window! We booked and paid for a room with windows, only to discover upon our arrival that not a single room in the hostel has windows! Of course, we contacted Booking.com customer service immediately, and after a few days we received just a few generic messages explaining how this has nothing to do with their management, we should ask the host for a refund. Can you imagine a situation like this? You've paid for something you didn't get, you had to spend the whole day looking for another room (Lisbon is a tourist mess in the summer) and then the company's customer support tells you it's not their problem! Outrageous. We managed to get our money back (minus 33 euros for Booking reservation fee or whatever) after I've threatened the host with a lawsuit (Portuguese are not really the most fair people in the world). All this hustle was the last thing we needed during our two-week vacation...A warm piece of advice: avoid Booking.com at all costs. Seriously.        	                1	1	Thursday	booking	positive
136	            AVOID!!!They are only good at taking your money but once the property cheats you they will make it impossible for you to get your money back or fair compensation.  My property did not provide all rooms booked, when I asked for compensation I called I  7x and EACH TIME they put me in hold for 30 to 40 minutes,  LIEX that they would look into it then put me on hold and hung up and left no trace of my complaint in the system. How this company is in business is a scandal. Their properties are overpriced s*&amp;tholes and it is all just a racket go scam customers,  whose money they gladly take but whom they do not give a hoot about.

137	            Never book service apartment through booking.com, I have been made out of pocket £2,250 paid for accommodation thought to be a luxury stay in Knightsbridge, based on photographs advertise.  It is the first time using booking.com and very last!I arrived at the apartment to find the property to be not as per photographs however I was rushed into getting my payment and without taking further inspections later found the property to be dirty and disgusting.  Guests arrived late, therefore, had to stay less than 12 hours, after asking for refunds we were not successful, booking.com was useless and unable to assist.  This is based on missold and not as purchased.  Still trying to fight for this myself without booking.com's help. Paid £2,250 and booking.com came back with a mere fraction of £300 goodwill which I refused and still trying to fight this battle myself.        	                1	1	Thursday	booking	negative

I accidentally gave an incorrect email address when booking my hotel last week, which meant I had no confirmation. I called earlier today for help and the man was so unhelpful, and then just hung up on me..... luckily I contacted the hotel directly and they were extremely helpful but I will avoid Booking.com in future and book directly through the hotel!        	                3	1	Wednesday	booking	negative
140	            Very bad services. Had terrible expereience with them. Booked a hotel on their website and then cancelled within the free cancellation deadline due to change of plan. Later when I checked my bank account statements I found out the hotel had charged me full amount without my knowledge. Neither the booking.com nor the hotel had ever informed me of this. I had to call the booking.com 3 times in order to get a refund. Finally the refund came through after more than 4 months since the cancellation was made, but the amount was less than what the hotel had charged. Called the booking.com the 4th and 5th time about the shortage and was told the shortage was because of currency exchange and they won't do anything about it. One of their customer service staff with American accent called S** was rude too! So word of advice - DO NOT USE BOOKING.COM! If you provide them with bank card details you will never know if and when you are being charged unless you are checking at your bank account statements every day! Even though they'd say the card details are for guarantee only and won't be charged when you make the booking, don't believe it. I have never come across such problem with other booking platform and will never ever use booking.com again.        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

Seriously - my $4500 was removed from my credit card THE DAY I booked!! UNACCEPTABLE!  These rooms were booked 2 months in advance due to disability requirements - leaving three travellers no rooms and no access to necessities.

142	            I changed my email address on my booking.com page. As a result, all my previous bookings as well as a pending one and my genius points were gone. When I contacted the German customer service I was not helped. Instead I was repeatedly asked why I had to change my email address. Finally, I was told that after my next five bookings with booking.com I would get my genius-benefits back. Since I was not satisfied with this response, I asked to be connected to the supervisor in charge. But instead I was left on hold for quite a while, then someone just hung up on me. Minutes later I sent customer service an email repeating my problem. No response. Two days later I sent another email. No response either. In the meantime I have contacted Tripadvisor.com which workes closely with booking.com. Maybe they will tell their partner not only how to fix such a problem, but also how to treat customers with professionally and with respect. In the meantime I do my travel reservations with other companies. Fortunately, we do have the choice.        	                2	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

Nearly three weeks ago I wass told a refund has been issued, I have chased and chase this onyl to be told each time it will be escalated,cant speak to a manager, told that there is no where for customers to escalate and still my refund has not appeared.

Facing surprises in a foreign country and not knowing where to go could be very terrifying. The good point was, when I sent them some picture of the property condition they handled it very quickly and cancelled the reservation through the property immediately. However, they did not follow up with the refund so two month past and my $1100.was not refunded yet. I contacted their customer service and I was connected to Michigan call center. That was another nightmare .they were rude, they hang up on you, did not take one-step to help. Asked for supervisor her name was Maria and she was worst than others. Fortunately, next time I tried, I was connected to their customer service in Toronto and they were fabulous. their supervisor offered to take over the case and finally refunded my money after 21/2 month.   The experience in the hotel, called themselves Mehmet Efendi Mansion was not enough, I had to encounter with the worst customer service ever.        	                4	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

I cancelled the reservation immediately on 25th September at 12.23 AM within 11 minutes since the rooms they confirmed were not matching to the information I furnished.3. But booking.com was holding on to my cancellation request till 26 September 6.32 PM 4. I then sent an email to booking.com for which I received response from their  support staff. The email clearly states that my reservation is eligible for free cancellation. I have been getting different response each time from different support staff.. Request you to kindly take one stand on this issue and not make the customer a scapegoat for your team's ignorance.5. Secondly the room charges are Rs. 6000 and 5500 respectively for 2 rooms which totals to Rs. 11500 (inclusive of all the charges). This has also been stated in the cancellation confirmation email attached but I have been charged Rs.13570 to my credit card (screenshot attached). Please clarify the additional charges. I can also send the pdf version of the statement if required.This email has all the fine grained details to prove the mistakes done by booking.com in not being transparent to the customer. I have been getting excellent customer service from sites like Agoda.com and makemytrip.com.  I feel very sorry for having chosen Booking.com for my reservations. Booking.com has been unapologetic and adamant in their response each time.

148	            I would like to commend the customer service dept. of Booking.com for their speedy help in resolving a problem I had.We booked a room with Booking.com  in a B&amp;B in Katvyk, Holland for 4 nights.   The town was booked solid for a special weekend.   First impressions were of an   OK room except for the smallest bathroom we have ever seen, but later neither of us got any sleep as the mattress was very soft and totally clapped out.   We knew we could not survive another 3 nights on that bed, and when  we arose in the morning at 6am, I went online to see if there was last minute availability anywhere, and found Booking.com had a room in a nearby  hotel for 3 nights, which I booked and paid for immediately.   We explained to the owner of the B&amp;B why we were quitting  early.I emailed Booking.com explaining the situation, and to my surprise received a very sympathetic response an hour later- and this was a Sunday morning!   They asked for some more info., to which I replied immediately, and later the same day a second email came from them saying they would be contacting the owner of the B&amp;B  for his response.3 days later another email told me that Booking.com would be sending me 75 euros refund  from their own account, and that the owner of the B&amp;B would be sending me his refund for 2 of the 3 nights that I had cancelled.   Both payments were refunded separately  to my credit card 24 hours later!Well done Booking.com for this amazingly speedy and positive  customer  service.        	                33	5	Monday	booking	positive

151	"            KONNOS BAY HOTEL APARTMENTSAnother Perfect Holiday!Review of Konnos Bay Hotel ApartmentsReviewed 2 days agoAs for every year since 1995 we stayed at Konnos Bay Hotel Apartments for three weeks in September 2018. Our holidaywas as good as it always is and the familiarity only makes the experience sweeter. Having explored Cyprus extensively over 24 years we know the island well, and our main reason for staying at Konnos Bay Hotel Apartments is that of relaxing in a perfect (for us) environment. We always have the same apartment overlooking the beautiful bay. and we swim in the crystal clear waters twice a day (morning and afternoon) for at least an hour or more on each occasion. For those who want a more active time, Mike's Water Sports offers a complete range of activities, with safety as the prine consideration.We have made many Cypriot friends over the years, amonst them the manager Adamandini ably supported by Tsonga. The care and attention and support from Adamandini is second to none, and she will solve any problem which may arise, again ably supported by Tsonga. It is not just us who gets this support, although we are made to feel special, Adamandini makes every guest feel special. There were small improvements this year, with new beds and mattresses, but the same feeling of contentment made the holiday as special as it always is. Perhaps what makes Konnos Bay special for us is the wonderful view of the bay, and, even the walk down from our apartment to the beach in the rural settings. We spend a lot of time just relaxing on our balcony, reading lots of books, swimming in the crystal clear warm sea. The rooms have a kettle, a toaster and a microwave (the microwave is a welcome recent addition. We usually have breakfast in our apartment and generally eat out every evening. This year we discovered a new restaurant in Protars (Island Affair) and it has become our favourate (I have posted a seperate review of this restaurant). I should say that Pirillis restaurant at Konnos Bay has greaty inoroved, and can also be recommended.We always have a car, which generally we use only for going oput in the evenings and shopping at the quite large Lidl store for basics such as milk, water, etc but they do have an excellent selection of wine, spirits, etc. We rent our car from Windmills Car Rental in Protaras, and I have previously posted a review on that service, which is excellent value and totally reliable. Having said that, for those who do not want a car, there is an excellent bus service right outside Konnos Bay Hotel Apartment, and very cheap,I would strongly recommend Konnos Bay Hotel Apartmens for a totally relaxing holiday, more so, but different, from staying in a five star hotel! Will we be returning to Konnos Bay in 2019? Well I will be 84 and my wife 79, so,""God willing, we will!Show lessRoom Tip: Choose a view with sea view,•	Stayed: September 2018, travelled as a coupleo	Roomso	Cleanlinesso	ServiceAsk ProfTerry about Konnos Bay Hotel Apartments        "	                1	5	Monday	booking	positive
152	            Terrible experience. Recommend you stay away.Booked a penthouse apartment for 3 romantic nights in KL:    KL LUXURY 3 Kuala Lumpur @regalia  via booking.comTurned up, it wasn't a penthouse. Nor was it an apartment - it was a room in an overcrowded shared flat with a broken shower, broken aircon and broken wifi. Their agent was over an hour late, would only take cash, and refused to give us a receipt. We were basically stuck, so had to pay to get somewhere to sleep despite it being significantly not as described, but we obviously resolved to open a complaint with booking.com. At this point booking.com could have made it all better by taking our complaint seriously, but no. Every step of the way their complaints process is set up to protect the people renting (including the fraudulent ones like ours), and not the holidaymakers. They are rude on the phone and do not listen to simple details. They tried to just close my complaint without resolution or compensation, for no reason ('sorry you've been let down').Booking.com basically don't give a damn, and are refusing to refund or compensate. First of all they chased me for a card receipt to prove we paid - for a property that is clearly advertised as cash only. How can I provide a proof document that can never exist??  So then they wanted a cash receipt. But because their guy on the ground refused to give us a receipt for the cash (he said something about the malaysian taxman - we were naiive and jetlagged) , he is claiming we never stayed at the property, so booking.com are refusing to listen, treating it as a 'last minute cancellation' and are refusing to believe we stayed there - this despite us having the wifi passwords, photos, my card transactions from the restaurant, us signing into the pool at security with our room number and there no doubt being a stack of cctv of us in and out of the building. But apparently it's only that cash receipt that counts. The one their provider refused to give. Reading the recent reviews it seems we are not the first to be caught out by this trick at this property, not the first to be denied appropriate redress, and booking.com continue not to care.And to top it all, despite being well aware of the issues, they are still advertising the property as a penthouse suite on the website!!I wish wish wish I'd have chosen accomodation with card payment and used my Amex. Amex eat ripoff merchants like booking.com for breakfast. I suggest that's what you do too, unless you also want your holiday ruined.        	                10	1	Monday	booking	negative

159	"            Don't use this site. It is very misleading.The site encourages you to book through them in a number of 'misleading' ways. Many of which are extremely questionable.1. Type in a city or postcode and a list of hotels pops up. But, they're not arranged in order of price or location. They seem to be random. You have to 'filter' the results if you want to get that kind of information.2. Writing this review, I opened Booking.com on another tab and typed in a nearby city name. The very first hotel shown had a big red label saying ""You're too late! No rooms left at this property on our site.""Why show a fully booked hotel with no availability at the top of the search results unless they're trying to scare you into thinking that you'd better book somewhere else quickly.3.The review scores are artificially inflated. You have to select from a number of boxes for each area you rate. Select the happy face and the hotel gets full mark's. Select the angry face though, and the hotel gets fewer points.... but still gets some! I went through a dummy review and the lowest score out of 10 that I was able to give was 5.4! I selected the lowest, angriest face possible in each category, yet the hotel still came away with a score of 5.4 out of 10!4. Don't believe the wording they use. I booked one hotel in South Milford specifically because it had a pool. When I arrived, the manager apologized and said that the pool had been closed for refurbishment some months ago and although Booking.com had been told this on numerous occasions, the advert still listed the hotel as having a pool and showed photos of it.Mosborough Hall hotel had a warning saying that I should hurry up as there were only 2 Delux rooms remaining. I know the hotel very well, so I know that they only have 2 delux rooms anyway!5. If anything goes wrong with your booking, don't expect them to help. I booked a room and paid online via their site. I had a confirmation email and text and all seemed fine. Then, at 5am on the day of the booking, I was woken up by an email from the hotel and another from Booking.com telling me that my payment card had been declined and my booking had been cancelled. Fearing fraud on my account I phoned the bank straight away to talk to the 24hr fraud team. They said there was nothing wrong and they hadn't even had a request from the hotel for payment. If they had, I was assured that there was no reason it wouldn't have been paid. So, I then called the hotel and was told that they had not received the three digit CVC security code from the back of the card. Using the same card, I paid over the phone and the payment was authorized by my bank straight away.I emailed Booking.com to complain and ask what was going on, only to be told in no uncertain terms that it wasn't their problem and that I should phone the hotel if I wanted to get any information.As far as I am concerned, they found the hotel for me. They processed the payment and booking with all the information needed. They then sent me an email confirming the booking had been made. But, when something went wrong, they weren't interested. Thank God I was able to see the email. If it had come an hour or two later, I'd have left home and wouldn't have known I had no hotel room until I tried to check in.

160	            Booking is one of the less transparent sites. They are not straight cheaters, but they use the lack of transparency to make you choose them. It is extrem difficult to see extra fees and tax until it is too late. In other sites like hotels.com and agoda.com, it is much more clear what you need to pay. My advice, use other sites, but if you want to use booking use time enough reading all the small details, because when you contact them to claim, they use these small details against you.        	                5	2	Friday	booking	neutral

It's 2 months we are waiting that money back.3) When I check on their website for Netherlands people we saw the hotel they told was closed that was available and they was trying to book 2 rooms like the 2 rooms we booked but at an higher price (we booked at €368 and on the Netherlands booking website was €740 per room) We write to them for an explanation but nobody reply and when we call the  Italian office the person answer was saying excuse the she was from another department and doesn't know nothing.ps I dont' write my Reference number because my reservation has to be use soon I for sure they are able to cancel it as they did, like big rascals they are.

173	            I was a customer of Booking.com for the last 14 years but no more.  I had a largely good experience because I think I am quite aware and carefully check reviews etc for places before staying and normally it has worked out well.  I usually only consider places with a review score of 8 out of 10 and higher.  However, I recommended Booking.com to a friend who is a refugee and suffering from PTSD and I helped book a B &amp; B for her which was great.  Unfortunately she recently booked a hotel herself in London for 3 nights (Kings Hotel, Kings Cross) and did not read the reviews. Her English is rather good but she reads it more slowly as it is her second language.  She did not want to bother me by asking for help again.  She went off Booking.com's description which made it sound OK or even good and there were scrolling messages about reviews saying things such as 'rated Clean - 15 reviews' The rating was only 5.8 out of 10 but if you clicked to look closely at the reviews, all the reviews this year were 2, 3 or max 4 out of 10 with all saying how terrible it was, filthy, unfit for human habitation etc etc.and how people were shocked that Booking.com listed the place.  There was no way she could stay here as she is a very clean and sensitive person but the booking was stated as without cancellation.  I rang Booking.com and said how upset I was that they had advertised this in a 'rose tinted way' and explained about her situation and asked if they would cancel the booking as she could not stay.  They said they would ask the hotel to cancel 'but it was nothing to do with them'.  I stated that I believe it is as they have advertised it in a misleading way and therefore should be guilty under the trades descriptions act or similar.  One man I spoke to sounded somewhat sympathetic but would not accept any responsibility on their part.  We even rebooked for an alternative B &amp; B in London for the same dates through Booking.com (at Iolanthe 8.5/10 which she said was excellent).  Booking.com simply reported that the hotel would not refund, no surprise as they are obviously horrible people from the reviews left, and Booking.com refused to do anymore about it.  I looked up the email address of the CEO of Booking.com and wrote to her explaining the situation and asking for help.  She did not respond but passed it onto someone to deal with in the executive team but their response was pathetic and showed they did not bother to read my email properly at all.  After much silence they have finally responded that they have again asked the hotel to refund who have again refused and that is the end of the matter.I tried to ring Trading Standards but no reply to my call there.  Another useless, toothless organisation I think.  therefore my only redress seems to leave my negative review to try to ensure others don't suffer the same sort of fate.  Please try some other company as I will be doing myself in future.        	                6	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

I have queried and filed a claim with booking.com as soon as this was noted (same day) and they have sent me repeated template communications asking to provide evidence for the charge which I promptly submitted.  After several communications (calls and emails) I finally received an email confirmation (10 days ago) from one of their customer service team to confirm the refund shall be processed but subsequent follow up phone calls/ emails led to the same standard template replies (with a few change of words) to say that they again need to investigate the matter to advise their finding?!? The matter has been escalated to 2 supervisors on 2 occasions but seems to have little effect in following up/ getting the matter resolved (refund) - lots of words but little result.  Instead again, the same response from the supervisor!  All they need to do is to read the notes and the emails communications to understand the whole situation but they just seems to be going around in circles to buy time and delay the refund. My last call with them (last night), the agent 'promised' to give me a call back with an update.  Surprise!  No call!

I asked her why this is provided to the customer as an option on booking.com and she told me it wasn't her problem and to go to booking.I phoned booking.com who told me this is always the case... strange that its not written anywhere (apparently its hidden on there somewhere if you hover over an icon near room rates section but definitely not clearly stated anywhere) and if you are not allowed to pay upon arrival why provide people with this option when confirming their non-cancellation booking?        	                1	2	Tuesday	booking	negative

Long wait to get through, spoke to Tom who contacted the hotel and they agree to refund our costs, great I thought. It got worse from there on. I asked Tom to book me another night nearby he informed me he couldn’t, I must do so myself online. I tried to explain we didn’t have WiFi or data, had just driven for 6 hours, it was 90 degrees and as a middle aged couple we didn’t want to sleep in the car. He really couldn’t care less. He was rude and unhelpful. He wouldn’t let me speak to a manager and although I was calm he accused me of shouting. Booking.com do not care about their customers in times of need, a true test of any company is how they deal with complaints. Will reconsider any future booking as plenty of alternatives out there. After a long and fruitless telephone conversation my only option was to drive around and find somewhere with WIFI and book myself. Thanks for nothing Booking.com.

197	            Had a place booked for September 21st. Property cancelled night before. So gutted as had funeral to go to and didn't need this extra hassle.Spoke to booking. They could not put the money already spent on another property. Would have to wait 3-7 days for refund.Really annoyed as didn't have any more money to spend on another property. Ended up having to drive to destination on the day. Anyway.... Refund was meant to come in 12 days (so time increased)It's been waaay over 12 days and still no refund. Called them and they say 'sorry please bear with us'....Service is beyond words.... Awful. Never known anything like it at all!        	                1	1	Saturday	booking	negative
198	            Feel like I need to write a review on behalf of my friends! Now I have booked with booking.com many times and so have they and we have had no problems till now. Two of my friends booked a hotel months ago  (about May time) for my 40th birthday party in the New Forest at the east close hotel and are due to be staying there next week. About 6-8 weeks ago they got an email saying the hotel was closing down and they would get a refund! To date still no refund! They have chased booking.com, let’s just say a chocolate teapot would be more use! Booking.com took the money not the hotel so why can’t they just refund the money! Why should my friends have to keep chasing it as well! What a terrible service! You should be ashamed of yourself booking.com!        	                10	1	Saturday	booking	positive
199	            We were traveling and lost credit cards, as we were travelling we don't check emails regularly. Our next hotel tried to charge our card when they specifically said when we booked pay at hotel. The card had been stopped yet booking chose to email us even though they had our mobile and a back up credit card. They gave us 24hrs.. we responded in 26hrs basically the responce was tough!! the hotel has now sold the room so deal with it yourself. I asked why they take a phone number for emergency when they don't use it or do they not call this an emergency i got no reply.poor customer service never again as don't need to be left in lurch when you on holiday, just can't be trusted to deliver. My advice  use google and book direct.        	                1	1	Saturday	booking	negative
200	            I made a reservation on 9/6/2018 with booking.com, as our family is traveling to San Marcos for my sons college graduation. I received a confirmation email with reservation number and pin. I tried to edit the reservation to extend it for an additional night. The booking.com website said that there were no rooms available for the Saturday 12/16/2018 that I was trying to add. I am aware that sites such as this only have access to so many rooms, so I contacted the hotel reservation number. The nationwide reservation number was unable to locate my reservation for Friday 12/14/2018. I ended the call with them and contacted the hotel directly in San Marcos. The gentleman I spoke with was also unable to locate my reservation and proceeded to tell me that the hotel is sold out for that Friday evening, so I could not even book it directly with him.  He went on to say that they have had problems as of late with others showing up with reservations made on booking.com and the hotel has no record of their reservation and unfortunately when these people arrived the hotel was sold out and they had no place to stay!! Thank goodness I tried to make a change to this reservation or I would have arrived and had no place to stay in a town that will most likely be sold out that weekend due to the college graduation!! I am relieved that I did not prepay for this room or I would be dealing with filing a fraud charge on my credit card as well. I have never before used a website such as this (for this very reason) and will NEVER do so again. I certainly will NEVER recommend booking.com to anyone as their practice of making non existent reservations is FRAUDULENT!!***UPDATE***I just contacted the hotel directly again and spoke with Tamara, front desk agent and sales manager. I was able to make a reservation for Friday and Saturday as needed when I changed the room from a king to double queen. However, I did take the last room for this. In addition, Tamara updated me that she has been dealing with booking.com for months. Booking.com is not authorized to sell rooms for this hotel. And Choice Hotels has been unable to get them to stop!! I wonder how many other hotels they sell rooms for that they are not authorized to do so?  Apparently what happens is booking sends the reservations they have made for the hotel only a week before the date of the reservation. The sales manager at the hotel now has to deal with the fallout of this.  She states that she has to go through a list on a weekly basis to notify booking.com of each reservation that has been made that is not valid. It is supposed to be up to booking.com to contact all the people that booked with them to let them know that a room is not actually available. This of course is a huge hassle for the guest to deal with so close to their scheduled trip. She continued to inform me that booking.com often does NOT contact everyone and she has a guest arrive who of course is furious as they don't have a room. She does try to help them locate another hotel, but instructs them they will have to contact booking.com directly, probably sit on hold for an hour and then informs the guest of the policy that booking.com has to pay that they are responsible for relocating you and if they cannot find a similar hotel at the same price they are responsible for paying the difference. In short AVOID booking.com at all costs as you will have no way of knowing if you actually have a room!!        	                1	1	Saturday	booking	negative
201	"            We booked a hotel in Thailand through booking.com. The terms were non-refundable. However the distance from the hotel to nearest town was 1 hour by car, and not 30 minutes as stated on booking.com when we did the booking. Booking.com didn't agree to cancel the booking, and only agreed to refund one night (we had 8). We used A LOT of time with their support, both Danish and English speaking, and they seemed VERY uncoordinated. They came to be so desperate in their arguments, that they claimed to inform all distances in straights line between locations.... Odd when they also add ""by car""! Hilarious. Maybe flying cars? And at what speed then?? It's a really long story. But the bottomline is that we'll book all of our future hotels through other sites. NEVER Booking.com again!!

202	            I booked 5 nights in Manhattan using their website as they had their free cancellation policy.  They then email me the confirmation saying it was non refundable.  I then called them immediately and they refused to cancel the booking.  The staff were friendly but refused to do anything about it.  They emailed the manager of the hotel and called them.  They said it was at the discretion of the hotel to cancel the booking and there is nothing they can do about it, quoting that this hotel is renound for being strict with their cancellation policy? I said I had clicked the free cancellation check box which they put next to the non refundable check box.  Possibly the most stupid design for a web page possible.  After my 5 th call they said my only option was to ring the hotel.  I then had to ring from the uk and beg like a dog ! There's no other was to put it, until he finally cancelled my reservation and refunded me.  Absolute nightmare will not use booking.com again.  In fine print it's also written the hotel can take money out of your account whenever they want to.        	                1	1	Saturday	booking	negative
203	            I am a regular customer with Booking.com and have stayed in some fantastic accommodation. Sadly, the true test of a great company is how they deal with complaints or problems. In this regard Booking.Com are very lacking.I had a two night trip booked in Biarritz in Sept '18.The accommodation was awful.The owner failed to maintain contact, therefore my only redress was booking.com.I had to leave a night early because of the poor standard of the room.The owner has refused to engage. Booking.com offered a 15%refund and no further option except to contact the owner, which I have.There's still no satisfactory resolution and furthermore I am unable to leave a review about this property on the website in order to warn other potential customers.So Booking.Com, if you want your reputation as a trustworthy site to remain, deal with sub standard property and rouge owners.        	                4	1	Saturday	booking	neutral
204	            very poor administration and resolution of problems in this company. I have used them several times over the last few years, and therefore thought I would be treated as a loyal customer, but not a bit of it. they take days to respond to emails, don't actually seem to read my emails as they don't respond appropriately. I have been overcharged by 2 hotels on a recent holiday, and in my opinion the responsibility is theirs to sort it out, but their last email suggested I phone Latvia and Estonia to sort it out myself!! I have serious doubts about using them in the future, it's all too much hassle when there's a problem.        	                3	1	Saturday	booking	negative

I got confirmation from booking.com and yesterday they took £340.66 in full from my bank account. Today I get an email saying it is cancelled. No refund, little help from them despite everything being done through their website. I did not cancel the booking, they did a day after they took the payment. They have one chance to sort this now or I'm going to court. Total rubbish so far, pathetic customer service and it feels like a scam.        	                2	1	Friday	booking	negative
207	            My website of choice to go to when looking for holiday accommodation.I love the fact as a Genius member I get discounts applied automatically.Many of the hotels, rooms, pensions etc offer a Free Cancellation up to a few days before my break starts. Ok, I will pay slightly more for this option but it means should anything go wrong prior to my travel dates I can change it without cost.I've also found better deals after I've made my reservation and have been able to use the free cancellation option to switch to the lower priced deal.We've never had any issues with the rooms not being booked as per the reservation and the response either from Booking.com itself or from the accommodation supplier have always been quick, polite and helpful.I have 3 accommodations already held off for our forthcoming trip to Morocco - all are on free cancellation and I've switched one already due to reading a review which worried me, so I cancelled and changed it to one which was recommended by a member of a Morocco travel advice group I'm using.Thousands of hotel choice, great filter options so you can choose exactly the type of accommodation you want.        	                9	5	Friday	booking	positive

211	            Used booking.com for a lot of bookings, usually satisfactory , but this is due to the 'partner' hotel keeping up the promises. If you run into issues with booking.com then there is no contact available on site, it's hard to reach them from abroad. Also if you have a conflict with a property ( or they try to overcharge you almost double ) booking.com will just state that they are only the intermediary, and not responsible for anything. They also refuse to delist fraudulent properties from their site. The property in question is Sea View Apartment in Down Town, 7 Sofiivs'ka Street in Odessa, which is a a fraudulent listing, offering a price way under market value. On the spot they will ask for much more, or refuse you to stay there. If you try to complain to the owner he will simply stop picking up the phone. So far, booking refused to take any action on this, duping possibly much more customers.        	                2	2	Thursday	booking	negative
212	            We had a terrible experience with our first time using booking.comWe got a different room than we booked when we arrived at Raj Boston. At first we were told by the hotel that this is because they received a request for a rollover bed, which at least didn't come from us.When we were calling booking.com what's going on, they first told me the same reason as the hotel did - someone made the request.When we told them that's not possible, they tell us that this is because we arrived late.However, we did early check in through phone. And when booking the room, it says***Your estimated time of arrival (optional)******24-hour front desk: You can arrive anytime you want – your room will be ready at 3:00 PM***It's optional to put down the time of arrival. We put it down only to make it easier for the hotel. However, the staff at booking.com insisted that it's a special request to arrive late and it needs to be approved by the hotel.When we ask them how do we know if it's approved, they say that we would've received a confirmation from the hotel. We did receive confirmation from both booking.com and the hotel. Neither of the letters mentioned there's any problem with our arrival time. Then how would one know if there's a problem with the reservation?It's not a big problem. Maybe the hotel ran out of rooms that we want. We would happily accommodate if we are told it's the case. However, from beginning to end during the communication,  the customer service and hotel insisted that it's something that we did caused this problem. I don't think it's the right attitude to serve and grow as a business. And apparently the communication between booking.com and the hotel is a mess so when they can't figure out the problem, they blame the customer.        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	neutral
213	            Buyer beware. We are currently on holiday in Italy and booked through Booking.com. The Elio &amp; Agata apartment is a hotel room with ensuite and balcony, the garden is some scrub tress and rusty pipes out the back of the hotel, the promised coffee maker is a kettle, the kitchen (yes it mentioned this is the advert Booking.com customer service people) amounts to a toaster and small fridge in the bedroom, the sink is cracked, free WiFi is restricted to 500mb a day (seriously in this day and age?!), the bidet has rust marks, the double bed is two singles pushed together (important detail when you are celebrating 25 years of marriage!) and all the advertised pool, bar, restaurant are shut for the season (which Booking.com claim they make obvious but it must be in very small print because we didn't see it.) The place we are staying in, Rapallo, is lovely, and provides a great base for heading down to explore the Cinque Terre (Five Lands) and the Portofino National Park which includes my reason for being here - Castello Brown in Portofino - the place where Elizabeth Von Arnim wrote The Enchanted April (called San Salvatore in the book) and where some of the film produced by the BBC was filmed.        	                2	1	Wednesday	booking	positive

Complete con artists based in the Netherlands so if you get any problems it is imposible to speak with anyone.I booked a hotel room on their website which failed to inform me that parking  charges applied for each night. Parking cost was £15 per night so it wiped out any savings made using thier website.Also part of the booking offered a £20 'refer a friend' deal and even though a friend booked via their link &amp; I had emails stating I would get the £20 payment they have refused to pay it.

216	            Even after my long-standing use of booking.com for many bookings, I did not know they can be so nasty &amp; stupid until I experienced a problem myself. Please do NOT book with your credit card info. You will get cheated. I used to wonder before why people are complaining. I never had any problem until recently. Once you have a problem &amp; they realise it is their mistake, they turn out to be arrogant and not reply emails except to send the same email over and over again requesting the following info:The cardholder’s nameThe bank logoThe merchant nameThe transaction date, amount and currencyWhen I complained I was overcharged for a hotel booking by 70%, they sent me a modification to my booking with the overcharged amount days after I completed my stay and complained to them. That is nasty and stupid. If they readily accepted their mistake, then they would have reached a win-win solution. Fortunately, I always go for good hotels and that is the reason I never had any problem. Even this issue, the hotel was decent enough to fix it. But even after that, booking.com continued to send the same stupid emails repeatedly.it is best to use expedia or hotels.com that provides great after sales service. We need to work with agents that provide great after sales service efficiently. Not keep fooling us around like booking.com. Only way I will use booking.com again is if they say no credit card required.

I called Booking.com's 'English' customer service line, was on hold for about 10 minutes then when I spoke to someone it turned out their English helpline was in ASIA! The man I spoke to assured me that Booking.com would honour the refund as I had not been given access to a room by the hotel. Since then they have not refunded my money and just keep replying to my emails saying 'we are sorry your stay was unsatisfactory' etc. WHAT STAY?

Having not received the money promised toward the 30 day mark I called Support who said we have now decided to change this to 60 days from the day of your return.

Low and behold they charged me the full price and refuse to refund full amount. On first contact they agreed they'd made a mistake but then changed to ""its your own fault"", as you contacted hotel directly. I dispute this I have never phoned, emailed or sent a text to this hotel or any other I booked through booking .com. They have not provided any evidence to support this only ""we say you contacted hotel directly"". They did offer 50% but this is not fair as I did everything in accordance with their rules, when I disputed this the offer was withdrawn. I will never book again and would not recommend this company to anyone, customer service is none existant, on the one hand they say you take too long to make a complaint then they take two weeks to reply to emails.

After we received confirmation from booking that it was accepted and paid all money, we purchased flights. Week after we received information that owner cancelled our booking, because the price was incorrect... so if we would like to stay, at this same location, we would need to pay more than twice!! Booking of course was glad to help and re-assurred us that it was good we contacted them and arrange re-location in  the worst case scenario...  It feels like it is my fault and my problem. Booking.com does not stick to their promises, they will not contact you, they cannot even pay us back the exact amount the we paid them.I never thought about looking booking.com reviews on trustpilot, but I am amazed how bad their are.

After I sent in the receipts of our accommodation i battled to find at such late notice. More than a month later I finally receive an email from booking.com stating that they can only refund me a third of the extra costs.Shocking service from Mahouraresorts &amp; Tourism and booking.com, first and last time i book with booking.com.

225	            I booked the Ema 2BR apartment (in Old Town Zadar) via Booking.com on 18th August, which was just over six weeks prior to traveling to Zadar. The accommodation was booked for 5 nights from 27th September to 02nd October.  At the time, I had noticed there was an offer of free airport transport to the apartment and back, which was included in the booking. When I got in touch with Andrej (the host) about our flight arrival time to Zadar, he disputed the fact that he offered free airport travel. I then got in touch with Booking.com who by this time had been instructed to remove these details from the apartment’s page. Luckily, I had taken a screenshot of this when my booking went through. After some resistance from a rather arrogant Booking.com employee, I was asked to send the screenshot to them and soon after came a follow-up phone call from Booking.com saying they’d be prepared to refund our travel costs from the airport and back. By all accounts, we thought this was the end of the matter and were looking forward to our short break in Zadar.Andrej (the host) had been in intermittent contact with myself and in fact e-mailed me on the 26th September (the day before we flew out to Zadar). After walking up three flights of stairs, his colleague tried to unlock the door to the apartment only to find there were other guests already in there. Now, given I had been corresponding with this host up until the day before we flew into Zadar, it came as a complete shock to us, to find that (a) both Booking.com and the host had not been honest enough to let us know the apartment was no longer available, despite us booking it over six weeks in advance and (b) it was now approaching 2200 and we had of course nowhere to stay during our stay in Zadar.A little after 2300, the host turned up with a bunch of keys and was completely unapologetic and said that he would put us up in another property for the night and would be in touch the next morning so we could let him know then, whether we’d like to continue staying at the second property or leave. He also told us that the original apartment we had booked was going to be unavailable for the duration of our stay in Zadar. It sounded like he had knowingly booked this apartment for other guests, and failed to inform us prior to our arrival.The host's colleague then took us to the second apartment which was a studio flat and lacked the many amenities offered at the first apartment. The first apartment had two bedrooms, a separate living room, a balcony and was much larger than the one we ended up in. The next morning, the host failed to make contact with us. I had sent an email to Booking.com the night before, alerting them on what had happened. When Booking.com contacted the host, he proceeded to lie and said that he had put us up in a much bigger and better apartment for the night. At this point, we made it clear that we did not want to continue our stay at his second apartment.Andrej (the host) then asked whether we'd consider staying at another of his properties, and provided us with a link to several properties to choose from. We were minded to select somewhere that was quite central (i.e. in Old Town Zadar) and somewhere similar to what we had booked originally. Because we did not want to waste much of our holiday searching for properties, we agreed to move into a third property of his. He soon followed our request up with an email saying that this property was now not going to be available until the third day of our stay in Zadar.  For your reference, please look out for Adria rentals on booking sites as his properties are listed on other sites such as Air B&amp;B also!At this point, we decided to cut ties with this fraudulent character and focus solely on trying to find alternative accommodation through Booking.com. I must say that one other frustrating thing was that Booking.com were extremely inept and unwilling to take ownership of this problem. They did not return our calls when promised to. Every time I called, I had to explain the issues from the very beginning to someone new! We informed Booking.com that we had found a flat that was away from the old town, but as this error was theirs to own, they should fund our taxi fares to and from the old town for the duration of our stay. Booking.com refused and said they were only prepared to issue a maximum of €25 towards our taxi fare costs for the remainder of our stay. An hour and twenty minutes later, we finally found an apartment nearby that fit a similar spec of the one we had initially booked. Andrej’s (the host) tried to charge us €70 for a night’s stay at a property we didn’t choose and one that was half the size of the one we had booked in the first place which cost €50 per night. Instead, he charged us the rate for ‘an on the day booking’ as if we had just rocked up at this second apartment without an advance booking. We decided to pay and walk away as we realised we were dealing with a deceitful, dishonest character.Our attention now turned to Booking.com who astonishingly were refusing to take the blame for this colossal mess-up. At this juncture, I proceeded to remind them that we were the innocent party here, and that they had entered into a contractual agreement with this crook, and were providing him with a platform to propagate his fraudulent activity. Eventually, Booking.com agreed to refund the €70 we had paid for the one night stay as song as we forwarded them the invoice. They however, were not considerate enough to acknowledge that we found this whole process extremely stressful, had lost a day of our holiday, because of their mistake and that we incurred financial loss in that Andrej had informed us he would only accept Euros for the initial booking and then upon securing the booking with a different company following all the problems we experienced, we were forced to convert our Euros into Kuna, because the owners of the apartment we ended up staying in for the rest of our time in Zadar would only accept payment in Kuna. So, we had changed our money from Sterling to Euro and then to Kuna within five days. The total cost of initial booking made six weeks ago was €250 for five nights. Because of all the problems we faced, the new accommodation cost us €314 euros for four nights. The taxis cost € 15 each way, the one night’s stay cost us €70. I have not calculated the cost of the exchanging our currency three times.I have posted my review on this platform, because, although Booking.com forwarded me a link via e-mail to review my experience on their site, they chose to reject my review, citing that I did not stay at the initial apartment hence I could not review it! I reminded Booking.com that had they kept their side of the bargain, we would not be having discussions or debates about this review as I had planned to keep my side of the bargain by checking in and out as per the booked dates. They then stopped corresponding with me.        	                1	1	Saturday	booking	negative

227	            Booking.com let me down.Stayed at Heathrow Premier Inn for 1 night and not impressed. When we arrived we were told that it was valet parking at £16.50 and our car would be moved to another car park so had to hand over our car keys or move it yourself. Well with 2 children in tow and luggage this was not possible as a busy road between the car park and hotel. So handed the keys over and paid the fee. I'm upset that this was not explained on Booking.com. I have stay with Premier Inn many times before so was very happy with the stay. Just annoyed that Booking.com didn't inform me of this. Another annoying unseen point was the distance from Chessigton world of adventure to hotel. I type in hotels in Chessington area and Heathrow came up saying 5 miles away. Will this wasn't true either as more like 26 miles away. Never again will I take Booking.com word for it and will be double checking hotels in future for true statistics.

In desperation today I have resorted to WRITING to them at their HQ in Amsterdam to try and have the issue resolved.  When we initially took over the business we were unable to take bookings for 6 weeks during the summer period - due to these same issues faced by the previous owners leaving and having the same problem.  When you leave as an owner, your access to the Extranet and therefore being able to contact ANYONE ceases.

240	            I spent weeks searching for the perfect place for our group of 20 to spend New Year's Eve.  After finally finding a place, getting every person to agree to it, and booking it I felt immensely relieved.  One day later I received an email that an error was made and the price would be $800 more than I had already charged to my card.  This put the price outside of my budget forcing us to cancel and begin the search all over again.  Regardless of if the error was made by the property owner, Booking.com should work to make things right with the customer, in this case covering the difference in cost.  If I booked a room on any other website (like Orbitz, Priceline, Expedia, Hotels.com) for $100 and the hotel meant to charge me $120, Orbitz would NEVER try to come back to me for an additional $20.  These other websites are real companies who care about maintaining their customers, clearly Booking.com is not.

245	            they are big (trustworthy infrastructure and client service behind) and their webpage is outstanding BUT: lately they are including among their offer of accomodation cheap small places with very few guarantees.If you (like me) have a problem with them, booking cancels unilaterally in the name of the small place, so you end up vulnerable AND with no chance to complaint or  tell the world what really happen (if they cancel you cannot submit your review for the hotel's profile), so these places end up with very favourable critiques, which are ONLY a selected sample of satisfied users, excluding the bad or very bad experiences (my last one with bedbugs in a place in Athens, where I ended up looking for a place at 1 in the morning. Since I had to sleep in a hostel, I was not compensated because the latter was cheaper (and of course MUCH WORSE) than the place I had initially booked. this ruined my trip and no one cared. now i have been cancelled a place unilaterally because you cannot check in after 10pm (and my flight lands at 9.30pm).

Next time I'll just book directly with the hotels and will not be using Booking.com again since they are useless in being the middle man.        	                1	3	Tuesday	booking	negative

249	"            I reserved a room in Rome through Booking.com that turned out to be in a building with a drug-den bar downstairs and wreaked of mold and mildew. I physically couldn't stay there and had to pay for another room elsewhere. Booking.com sent me some pro-forma replies expressing how sorry they were, but that they had no control over the owner's no refund policy. Surely, if Booking.com really wanted to get a provider to do something they could have.Also, I went back to look at the reviews of this place to see if I had done something wrong and was surprised to find the Bookings ranking system is a complete fraud. I gave the place negative reviews up and down, but the lowest score possible was 2.5, while others could give 9-10; this obviously is a statistically ploy to make rooms look better than they are. I also looked at many other reviews which were horrific, but, due to the way Booking tabulates their scores, showed up as a 6. One lady complained that, while staying in a hostel, she was placed in a room with men, people tried to break open her locked bags and that someone urinated on her towel and night shirt, and this review was given a score of around 6. Furthermore, beside the overall rating, if you look at how Booking.com cherry picks its reviews, the fraud is striking: this reservation was in a sleazy building with a loud bar, homeless people taking drugs outside and one person complained of dogs barking in the hallways at night, but the highlighted reviews claimed it was in a great location, clean and quiet. The real reviews were found only after my more extensive second look and more accurate reviews were on Trip Adviser. In summation: Booking.com puts this facility at the top of their list under the ""Genius"" program, skews the ranking higher, cherry picks reviews that seem out of touch with reality, and then when their customer is stuck in an unusable room in a foreign city basically says that it isn't their problem. So, I'm out almost $500 that the facility took, Booking got a cut of, and I'm out of luck.Whatever money you might save from this site when things go right, doesn't make up for the mistakes; next time, I will pay more up front for a real travel agent who will stand by their work.

254	            STAY AWAY! Long story short: booked an apartment for 4 nights in Paris, the place was overbooked.  They never said a thing to me, I realized because I called Paris one day before my trip.  They said they would relocate me and offered another apartment,  I was totally ok with it until they told me I had to pay the full amount for this booking. I expected them to just put me in another place that's more or less the amount I paid: 700€ but no, I had to pay the 700€ plus the 806€ for the new reservation, they claim they will give me my money back in 12 days. I'm honestly extremely angry and desperate because I'm traveling on a budget, I so needed that money for my stay in Paris, a friend had to pay the amount for me because I couldn't afford it, if I had paid I would be left without money for my expenses there. I called customer service (literally spent 3 hours on the phone),  explained the situation more than 10 times to different people, nobody gave a f. They said that I have to wait 12 days or more  to get my money back and that they are sorry I will be left without money for Paris, they just canceled the reservation without asking me first and didn't bother in offering me another place to stay (1 day before my trip). Btw, I really wonder why my money only took one minute to arrive to their accounts and I have to wait forever to get it back. I honestly expected them to fix the situation since they made the mistake.  I was just hoping to spend some beautiful days in Paris before having to go back to my home country.  The easiest thing to do was relocating me at no cost and that's it. TERRIBLE SERVICE, TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. TRY TO BOOK FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE IN A BUDGET LIKE ME. If I didn't have this friend to pay for me,  I would have been left with no money.Update: 12 days later and I still haven't received my money.        	                1	1	Sunday	booking	positive
255	            Problem with this site is that it doesn't inspect the accommodations before allowing them on their Website and if the Reviews about the accommodation aren't accurate, you can end up on a glorified building site! We booked Katoikia Oikonomou  Holiday Accommodation for family of 6 in Athikia Greece for 7 nights @ 140 Euros per night. The reviews at the time looked great and the pictures amazing. When we arrived it had no Air Conditioning (as previously stated on website page, now been removed). The interior photos of the accommodation were taken at such angles as to 'hide' the bare wiring/pipes hanging out of the wall/broken fly nets etc. Even the pictures of the swimming pool had been taken on a low trajectory to hide the floor of the pool's peeling paint.When you contact Booking.com they were 'rightly horrified' but ask for photographic evidence. You send the photos to them and the operator 'promises' a full refund (280 Euros) and that Booking.com will pay the difference for your 'emergency' accommodation (150 Euros) plus financial compensation for your inconvenience.However, when you get home from your holiday, despite having the receipts for the 'emergency' accommodation and them having transcripts of your lengthy phone conversations (4 hours) and 12 or so emails, they default on the refunds; only offering a refund (280 Euros) for the 2 nights  in the 'building site' accommodation.This accommodation is still being 'offered' to unsuspecting travellers because Booking.com tends to highlight the 'GOOD/VERY GOOD' reviews which may appear for a variety of reasons: Only stayed 1 night or stayed in Spring/Autumn so didn't need/notice that there wasn't Air Conditioning/Didn't use the pool etc. Booking.com doesn't 'Block' 'dishonest' owners from continuing to use their platform or even send someone to inspect a property to see if it is 'safe' for children to stay in etc. All this owner has now done is remove the words 'Air Conditioning' and replaced many of the interior photos with photos of the views from the accommodation. It's criminal that he will carry on getting away 'conning' unsuspecting travellers out of their hard earned cash with little or no retribution.        	                1	1	Saturday	booking	positive
256	"            I love it when I have the ""customer cuddling"" experience but with absolutely no resolution to my issue. I don't want to hear ""Sorry"" or ""I understand your frustration"" - I want someone to fix things! I've been booking hotels with Booking.com pretty much since they started. Hundred of nights in dozens of locations. Just recently I've had cause to contact them. A property on their site was misrepresenting the Terms and Conditions and then sought to impose a different set after the booking was made. I wouldn't agree - they wouldn't let me stay. To cut a long story short, Booking.com intervened and despite agreeing that I had a legitimate and justifiable complaint, they sided with their advertiser and it's ""No refund"" policy. Well, I find that totally unacceptable. I will never use Booking.com again. I'm a prolific reviewer and so they might have expected me to take to the webwaves - well here we are. It's a big mistake in my view to look after the crafty and misleading clients of yours who pay you a commission and turn against the people who really pay your bills - the hotel guests. I have a suspicion that Booking.com are going to learn this lesson the hard way - and without my money. Were quite good - now are worse than useless.

259	            Booked two nights accommodation in Athens via this company, paid, got confirmation and email address and phone number to ring to arrange check in. Arrived in Athens and followed there map, wasn't  there it was almost 2 km further along the street, got there it was a block of flats with no name matching the accommodation  name. I rang the number and they answered but when I said I  was waiting to get in they hung up. Must be a mistake I thought, I  rang again with the same result. I tried to contact bookings.com and was told that someone would contact me within 24 hours! Not impressed, it is pouring rain and I and my wife, we are 72 and 66, are wandering the streets of Athens ringing wet and without accommodation. We found a hotel for the night and moved to another one the next night which we booked and paid for on hotels.com. eventually we were rung by someone at bookings.com. No explanation for what happened or any reason why no assistancecwas forthcoming. They said we would be refunded for the accommodation we didn't  get, gee thanks. They also said if we had to pay more for alternative accommodation  they would look at the possibility of reimbursing  us the difference! We had to send them invoices from the hotels. The first night was easy, we were so desperate to get in out of the rain we took the first place we found and paid over the counter, the second night we booked through hotels.com. as anyone who has used these booking companies knows if you pay in advance the hotel doesn't  give you an invoice, in fact they don't even know how much you have paid. Bookings.com insisted i provide an invoice from the hotel even though i provided them with the invoice and receipt  from hotel.com. Basically the made an offer then put hurdles up that I  couldn't  jump so they didn't  have to pay me for there stuff up. What a low disreputable company, to go to this length to screw a customer, avoid them at all costs.        	                2	1	Saturday	booking	negative
260	            After booking what was described as a 4star hotel in Montenegro but was more like a prison with aged facilities worse than a 1 star we firstly asked to be moved or a refund at the hotel. They refused saying no refund and to complain to booking.com. We did but received no support at all, they said we should have complained at the hotel! We did ... They are still marketing this hotel as a 4star with photos that must have been taken many years ago! Never again will I trust Bookkng.com        	                3	1	Friday	booking	negative

262	            Booked 2 nights in Liverpool with this company. I wanted 2 nights non refundable. When I checked my invoice I noticed that I had been charged the pay at hotel rate that was £30 more and in the invoice it said free cancellation with no refund whatever that was supposed to mean. I used their online form to claim back the difference and of course heard no more from them. There are plenty of honest booking companies so I would strongly advise using the instead of this bunch of crooks.        	                5	1	Friday	booking	positive
263	            I booked a double room with Booking.com, then found it cheaper on Expedia, I contacted Booking.com to get my price reduced under their price promise. I sent the person I spoke to a screenshot of the Expedia page showing the cheaper price. I got a reply saying the price shown did not include tax, &amp; they would not price match it, it clearly did because it showed the breakdown of costs.A week or so later I had another email from Booking.com saying they could not match the price because the screenshot showed a price for a twin room, their price was for a double. I still have the screenshot &amp; it clearly states it is for a double room, so their staff have lied to me on two separate occasions. I will try make a complaint, but can't see it going anywhere.        	                28	1	Friday	booking	neutral

267	            I have just booked a hotel night via this organisation and found their service to be both unhelpful and disorganised.  When an issue arose about the booking they refused assistance because the hotel concerned had a 'privacy policy'. I was forced to make expensive international phone calls to resolve the matter. No value was added by booking through this organisation and will, In future, book directly with the hotel. I have now emailed on 2 occasions to request details of their complaints procedure but my emails have been ignored.        	                7	1	Thursday	booking	negative

270	            The worst customer service ever!!!!We asked to change room, due to the fact that there was no solid wall in our room, and it was smelling a lot, as McDonalds where in the groundfloor. When we expressed our complaints to the property owner, she said 'if we don't like it we can leave otherwise they would call the police'. When we said that we would rather wait for them, 2 russian guys showed up threatened our lives. We locked ourselves in the room and call the police.When we asked for a refund from booking.com (since we didnt even stay at the hotel, as was supposed), and after almost a month of negotiations they agreed on giving us back the ridiculous amount of 25 euros (I don't even know how they came up with this amount). In the system, it says that the refund is done, even though I haven't received anything. I contacted them a few times already, but I haven't received any reply.

271	            Booked accommodation in Amsterdam with booking.com after having read the reviews for the property in question (Fabulous - review).  On turning up at the property we suddenly realised why there was ONLY internal photographs. Our first impression was not Fabulous.  On accessing the booking.com account to cancel it was confirmed that we would have to pay the full amount for the duration of our stay. When contacted by booking.com to confirm why we did not stay at the property I confirmed that it was not as we expected.  Thereafter entailed a serious of email exchanges ending in booking.com basically confirming they leave the naming of property and pictures uploaded on their site to the property owner. That in mind, if anyone wants to stay at the London Palace (which looks like a flat in outter london) then I will be adding internal pictures to my account soon with some nice pictures of my best china tea set (I jest). If using booking.com then I suggest you only select properties with external photo's.        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	positive
272	            I will be honest I panicked and cried when I ended up booking via Booking.com. I selected the hotel I wanted via a different site and when the confirmation came it was booking.com. Each time I have booked with them the service has been terrible and the last time I was left stranded with no accommodation in a foreign country alone and they didn't care. They just said oh well try and find something else as we haven't charged you yet!. This time however was different. I booked a room in a hotel (I thought) for a week in Miami. When the confirmation came through it turns out it was holiday let inside a hotel but was not part of the hotel. We were able to use the facilities at the hotel but the room was basic and there were no services offered by the hotel during our stay. We did feel like we were second class and it was a little embarrassing. The confirmation was clear when it came and the correspondence from the owners of the holiday let was excellent. The room was good as a base but wasn't as we thought it would be. I wouldn't go out of my to book with booking.com as I do find their customer service and support the worst ever but have given 3 stars as my experience was good this time but the way the room was advertised was very misleading. I did contact them about this but as you can guess I had no response. All in all I wouldn't book with this company unless there was no other option.        	                3	3	Wednesday	booking	positive

276	            I have used Booking.com for a number of years now without any issues and have found everything to be fine and trustworthy. I was recently offered a £70 discount to use on my next booking. I thus booked my next trip meeting all the criteria to get the discount but once booked realised that I was meant to have used a unique link. On contacting them to explain my error and ask if, given the money have have spent over the years, they could amend the booking or offer a solution I was told NO. Sorry you lose nothing they can do. Very poor as this would surely have been a very simple matter for them to resolve. It is always the small things that irritate the most and this really irritates me. VERY VERY VERY POOR service. I will not recommend this service to anyone as if this the way they offer to treat valued customers God help them.        	                3	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

279	            We booked an apartment in London for a weekend away we where due to arrive have a quick wash and go to see the lion king so a quick turn around and go again. When we got to the address there was nobody there to meet us and we where stuck out on the street in the middle of soho, we rang booking.com to see if they could shed some light, they where unable to get hold of the owner of the apartment and said we had to allow him 30 minutes to answer before they could pursue another address for us to stay at, as the time ticked on it got closer and closer to the time we where supposed to be making our way to the theatre but still we had no alternative residence. My partner looked himself for availability and found a hotel about 10 minutes walk away, we suggested this to the man from booking.com and he agreed it would work from their end aswell, however, they could not book it for us they wanted us to book it ourselves over the internet and put down the extra money needed to stay there, this was not ideal whilst running through London with 4 suitcases trying to get there in time to drop our bags and go again. Booking.com although provided with all the relevant information refused to help us by booking us into the hotel online from their nice air conditioned office chair they insisted we must do it using a mobile phone whilst juggling bags and dodging Friday evening soho pedestrian traffic... not easy. When we finally got the the hotel the kind receptionist took one look at us and understood the situation immediately, he opened a cupboard for us to chuck our bags into and gave us good directions to the theatre, he even went as far as to chase us down with my mums forgotten inhaler (great guy) meanwhile booking.com are still on the phone insisting we pay the extra money and to also book ourselves in on a mobile phone offering no way of apology/promise of refund/anything helpful at all, we decided to end the phone call with them as they where entirely unhelpful. We made it just in time to the theatre, sweating and my mum on the verge of an asthma attack, not the image I originally had in my head of our arrival. Later that evening when we returned to the new hotel we had no choice but to put down more money in order to stay there for the 3 nights that we intended to stay, we decided not to ruin our weekend any further and waited until we got home to pursue our complaint 3 days later. (At which point we had yet to receive any sort of correspondence with booking.com) my mum contacted them when we got home and was told she would be refunded the extra money she had spent if she sent the booking details which she did over the phone but this evidence was not good enough so the lady said she would have to contact the hotel themselves to confirm and get the pap artwork they needed, they needed proof of a bank transfer from my mum which she provided immediately by email. 4 weeks later and still no refund or any sort of communication, so we have called them 4 times (the first 3 times we where simply hung up on) on the 4th attempt ‘Kathy’ informed us that they haven’t gathered any proof from the hotel even bough they said they would and the only way to get a refund is to provide them with a bank statement (breach of confidentiality) which we are not keen on sending as proof of any transaction even though they have been offered the invoice of the transaction which we have sought from the hotel ourselves but this legal binding receipt of payment is still not sufficient enough for booking.com. So where do we stand? Provide them with confidential information? Or sit out of pocket for a severe fault on their end, booking.com are not even willing to return the security deposit that was provided to them months ago for an apartment that we didn’t even see the inside of. A mistake can be forgiven but a sheer lack of customer service/empathy from any employee of booking.com cannot be.        	                1	1	Monday	booking	negative

My room wasn’t ready for 5 hours (7pm) and then the woman who claimed to “not work there” wouldn’t stop texting me throughout my stay. I wrote a lengthy review afterwards, sent 2 emails to booking.com and had a phone call requesting my money back. Nothing. 10 days later they offered half. Pfft this was about principal.

286	            Please note that I have made 2 nights bookings in Royal Vincent Hotel through this company. Iam really surprised to find the hotel premises which shows how unsafe &amp; unhealthy the hotel condition irrespective of customers of all ages. It is a horrible &amp; dirty hotel. There was nobody in the reception. As we have kids with us we were looking for a decent family oriented hotel without any disturbances. When I reach hotel nobody was there to receive at the reception, I have to call the receptionist &amp; when he came handed over the room keys &amp; left from the premises without giving any information about hotel whereabouts like an emergency exit.It’s very dirty hotel will not recommend any customer to even think of booking with them, one of the main &amp; genuine reason is they don’t have any concern of the guest &amp; they have totally neglected health and safety factor of the guest. I just don’t understand how the hotel owner expects the guest to get this type of service when he stays in a comfortable environment. When I spoke to the customer service of booking.com theypromised to refund the whole amount. We left the hotel without staying for another night &amp; have to pay EXTRA in Premier Inn Hotel which was far far better than Royal VINCENT HOTEL in BlackpoolAfter couple of days Booking decided to pay 25 euro as compensation which completely shows how they value the customers issue. Please arrange the full refund at the earliest. I sincerely request you to please remove this hotel booking details from your system to avoid further inconvenience to other customers.        	                4	1	Sunday	booking	neutral

295	            This company is dishonest with what they are saying about the 'SOL BEACH HOUSE HOTEL' in Palma Nova.They say: there is tea/coffee facilities in room Not true we were told we have to pay 5 euro a day REALLY I don't think so.Booking .com website also tells you the rooms have been renovated again Not true the room was basic it had old furniture and hard old beds.The staff were miserable and unhelpful.The website says there are drinks on arrival that appeared to be some lemons at the bottom of a big bottle filled with water accompanied by some dirty glasses - help yourself if needed.You assume as the hotel is overlooking the beach the sunbeds and umbrellas are free NO you will have to pay 13 euro for the priveledge of the beach. This is the 2nd time I have been disappointed with a booking but of course it's too late once you get to your hotel they already have your money.

As a partner they even take commission for guests that are cancelled.  They state it is last room left when it isn’t.  I am waiting for the time I will never have to use them again.  guests beware telephone the hotel direct.

Beside leaving me last minute without accommodation, they make it the responsibility of the customer to sort out the refund with the property which uses their website to sell (KesTour in Athens). I lost about five days scrambling for a solution and after plenty of misleading information I was told I was on my own. This could happen to you.        	                2	1	Thursday	booking	negative

After two months booking.com contact me to explain that a mistake was made on the pricing and that it needed to increase by £10 per night. I accepted, asked if we could pay the remainder once we arrived. 2 ours later the money was taken from my account!A week later they contacted me again to say that the Villa had made mistake and double booked. They offered to cancel for free, change the dates or move to a different apartment which was twice the price. I told them this was unacceptable, as it was there mistake not mine. Today they have sent me an email to say that the booking is cancelled. I did not agree to this and it is quite frankly appalling that they think it is acceptable to cancel a booking without even informing the customer first!AWFUL customer service.I will never use again!        	                1	1	Thursday	booking	negative

Took the money for two people. Got there only to find out they'd changed it to one person and they never bothered telling me. Cost me 13 hours worth of traveling. Over a thousand pounds and my job. Then blamed me. Then finally offered a refund of at least £600. Then they changed their story and wouldn't let me speak to a supervisor. Instead. I was passed from call centre to call centre.

305	            Booked a guesshouse  called Boston Beach Guest House in  Portland,Jamaica through them. It's was the nastiest place I've ever been to. Wasp nest in the room we stayed, insect dropping everywhere, bathroom smelled, dusty old furnitures.... among other horrible things.Anyways I wrote a review through booking.com 3 times to be exact giving my honest opinion based on what I had experienced and at no point at all was my review posted and that I am very upset about because people deserve to know the truth while looking a place to stay        	                3	1	Thursday	booking	negative

307	            We tried to book a week at a hotel with Internet, just after Hurricane Florence hit Wilmington, NC. We made it very clear, that m,any of the hotels/Motels were not open due to power loss and flooding.They claimed. that they booked us a room at Ameri Stay Inn on Market Street. Then they claimed the room was verified and confirmed.We got to the Hotel and it was completely closed due to power outageI suspect booking.com is not located in the US, since they are next to impossible to get up with. You also have to watch them since they claim no refunds. One more thing, they start spamming you immediately for more bookings.Can you imagine if someone from out of town booked with them and found the confirmed hotel was actually closed after driving into Wilmington? It would really put them in a serious bind. Especially if they had children.        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	negative
308	            Here is my review of this apartment that I booked on booking.com at the Whitsett Apartments in Studio City California:We rented the apartment from 9/23/18- 9/27/18.  The apartment is large and comfortable. Secure garage parking is a plus.  Some things persons visiting the area should know  especially short term rentals like ours:No wash cloths (byo) No hair dryer (byo) Pillows are inadequate on King sized bed (they are full sized pillows)No paper towels (byo) Toilet paper is provided but not enough for over a couple days (byo) TV is not a Smart TV,  if you want to watch Netflix,  Hulu etc.  Bring your own Amazon FirestickTowels are provided but only for a day so be prepared to wash towels daily.  They are not absorbent.Bathroom floors are extremely slick when you step out of the shower.   Inside of the showers are uber slippery, be careful.   No soap holder or shower shelves in the bath/ shower. Ice maker in refrigerator doesn't work.   Byo iceSpray function on kitchen faucet doesn't work. No kitchen towels. Bring your own or paper towels.  Very large closet in master with 3 hangers.  Byo  hangers. The washer and dryer are very old and cumbersome to use,  the dryer has a piece of wire fashioned as a handle for opening the dryer.   Once you hear the dryer buzzer go off that your load is dry... You pull the rigged handle to open the door but the dryer is still spinning so it's like a I Love Lucy episode retrieving your flying laundry from the dryer.  The apartment is located near many restaurants and there is a Big lots within a couple miles  you will probably need it,  that's where I purchased the above items for our stay so byo  or plan on spending more money on the apartment you rented.  So far my byo expenses are upwards of $100 on top of the $732 rental.  Overall it's a comfortable place you just have to bring most of your creature comforts with you.        	                1	2	Wednesday	booking	positive
309	            DO NOT BOOK!!!!!! DISGUSTED!!! I am writing in regards to a booking I made on your website for 26th September for 2 nights in Leicester.I cannot iterate how frustrated and disappointed I have been with your disgusting service!Firstly, I booked the Luxury Bedroom hotel for 2 nights and received confirmation that my booking was successful, I trusted your company and booked based on trust and made payment straight away.I then finished worked and drove to the property for my check in, where I was told that they have no available rooms and I will have to cancel. I cancelled the transaction which went through however the money did not reach my account and I had no further funds to make another booking at a different hotel for that night, taking in account that I now also had to look for alternative account last minute when I had work the next day at 5am in the morning.I rang you to tell you that I need the money as soon as possible as I need to make another booking and I was told by Erika that there is nothing she can do about my payment and can only cancel the booking and then look for alternative accommodations for me although I told her numerous times that I do not have the funds to make another booking.Having spent near 45mins on the phone already with no help from Erika who insisted there was nothing further she could do, I asked to speak to a manager. The manager came on to the phone and advised me that whatever funds I do have they can look to arrange another accommodation for me and they will ask the hotel to invoice them the difference. I was told I will received a call within 15-20mins, unsurprisingly I received no call thereafter.I then had to phone again after already spending over an hour on the phone then waiting another 45minutes and I spoke to someone called Sabrina R in the customer service department who tried contacting Erika who had apparently gone offline so in other words not planning to call me back but logged off the system. Sabrina then called hotels and provided me with hotel details for a hotel which looks almost like a dump and a hotel which I had seen on the website and would never in a million years ever book. I was provided with there details and asked to pay £30 when I get to the hotel. I was not at all happy about this as the hotel was absolutely disgusting! They said there was nothing further they could do, taking in account I was on the phone for over an hour and already spent more than 2 hours on the phone to booking.com and also taking in account that I wanted to check in to a hotel almost 5 hours ago and have worked the next day at 5am and being 6months pregnant where I am extremely tired and the disaster that was caused by you today is just unexplainable.Moreover, I then contacted my bank and explained the situation, they asked me to get an authorisation code of yourself and they would refund the money in to my account straight away. I then requested of you a authorisation code and I was told that you cannot provide this to me until 24 hours! The bank then advised that if the booking.com can confirm with them that the money will be refunded in to my account then they will refund the money in to my transaction straight away. However, Sabrina refused to confirm this to my bank. I then asked to speak to a manager, I spoke to Cory N as booking.com were unable to provide me with the property I had booked, unable to refund my money straight away, unable to give me an alternative accommodation and even unable to confirm with my bank to refund the money so I could get my money back!I am nearly 6 months pregnant, I was extremely tired, had work in the morning, my whole evening was ruined because of booking.com, I had nowhere to stay.Being a customer who books hotels every week, I have never ever in my whole experience came across a disgusted service as this! I cannot exaggerate how disappointed I have been with your service and will definitely share my experience with friends, family and reviews on the internet!        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	negative
310	            Jesus, I wish I had seen the reviews on here before booking my hotel through Booking.com. What an absolute crock, we went with a hotel that according to booking.com is really amazing and had a really good rating only to find out that it was utter rubbish, had to clean the room when we got there, stuff broken, cracks in the walls, unfinished repair jobs and loud music etc. The reason this is soo bvad is that when I went to rate it on booking .com; even giving it 1 out of 5 for most aspects it still labelled my review as 'Fabulous'. I was being honest and gave the location a full 5 stars but 'Fabulous' is a gross over statement. Basically it is stacked in favour of getting you to stay somewhere and getting your money rather than actually being honest. There are a load of negative reviews from people on there but they ONLY show the super happy ones on the main page. It's total BS marketing, go somewhere else to book your hotels!        	                6	1	Wednesday	booking	positive
311	            We face booking.com cold behavior that time !We are a hotelier and had a problem to pay booking com profit in once concerning 1 invoice ONLY !We had already paid half of the invoice and asked to pay the rest amount next month.This was due to one hotel small improvement in its facilities and for this reason we had to pay the small renovation and did not have enough money to pay rest money to booking.com.We asked from booking.com staff to give us this option and to pay rest half invoice in booking.com bank account next month!After that booking com sent email and called us saying that they do not mind about our problem and they wanted from us to do full payment immediately !Until the time of full payment they stopped our service and left our hotel alone without being in booking com alive !This is a unprofessional and inhuman behavior without concern in our hotel problem !All past years we paid on time and this is not fair for us !We have the right to write this example in any newspaper and portals of comments to show this behavior to all hoteliers and guests !At that time we are writing that we operate without booking com and fortunately we have reliable and good cooperators like expedia, hotelbeds, airbnb etc.We write that comment to show only to all other hoteliers that booking.com behavior is so professional but supports itself and its guests ! But booking com is paid by us, the hoteliers !So far we can not do nothing else ! Just to pray to have more reservations from other websites and send the rest of the invoice payment and wait to be alive again !        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	positive
312	            I booked my annual summer holiday through Booking.com. This was a mistake. Just 2 weeks before my stay, my hotel booking was cancelled out of the blue due to overbooking. I had already paid the full amount for my 6 night stay many weeks prior. They sent me a link to book a ‘similar’ hotel which was the only one available in the same area for less than double the original price. I had to book and pay for this hotel, which was £200 more expensive, out of my own pocket on top of what I had already paid for the original hotel. I was reassured that I would be refunded for the first hotel and that Booking.com would also reimburse me the £200 difference I had had to pay due to no fault of my own. I was indeed refunded the original hotel price, however I ended up in a 6.9/10 hotel instead of the original 9.6/10, having spent £200 more. Not great value for money. Upon arriving home I emailed the invoice of my stay to Booking.com in order to receive my £200 reimbursement and consequently received absolutely zero correspondence back. A week passed and I decided to call them to see what was going on. They said it had been passed on to the refund team and I would receive an email. Another week and nothing. The same story replayed again but I’m given a two week deadline within which I will DEFINITELY have my money. Two weeks pass and nothing again. Another call and a very casual ‘give it a week or two and it should be paid back’. It has now been another two weeks and a total of six weeks since my refund was ‘confirmed and passed on to the refund team’. Still no sign of my money or any desire to fix this. Long story short. NEVER USE THIS SITE. You are at risk of having your money stolen.        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	neutral
313	            Booking.com charges you a Full night stay plus tax to cancel your reservation. Even if it is over 2 weeks prior to reservation. This is crazy when you have no chose but to cancel.

Better to pay a little more and not use this, hire directly if you can or use another site.

318	            Used booking.com today to book a twin room at a youth hostel in Scotland. My booking was for 26/27 of October, I then received a confirmation email informing me that they had received my booking, taken payment, and that the youth hostel would be expecting me that evening. Realising the mistake I contacted the youth hostel and explained what had happened and they were very polite and understanding and were more happy to cancel the booking and refund my payment, though I had to contact booking.com. Tried but failed to contact them so tried to cancel booking through there website. Got a reply saying they have contacted the youth hostel and were waiting to hear back from them. Received another email telling me that the youth hostel are refusing to accept the cancellation and I have to pay the booking in full. I again contacted the youth hostel and again they were happy to cancel the booking.I have used booking.com a number of times but will not do so again, and I will advise others not to either.

321	            Wow!  I should have read the reviews before I purchased.  So Booking.com has a price match guarantee, I found a better price only a few hours after I booked it on Booking.com.  I took the time to contact Booking.com as it was all done and they did offer a price match.  They told me they couldn't honor it.... some strange thing about how the other company charges for the room.... what?  It was 300 bucks cheaper!!  Do whatever, 300 bucks is 300 bucks friend! I took the time to contact them and save the deal, I should have saved the time and just canceled.  So I wasted an hour and a half trying to give my business to a company that didn't want it....... I did cancel with booking.com and went with the other less expensive company  Good luck booking.com!        	                1	1	Sunday	booking	positive
322	            Booked a hotel room via booking.com. Paid and received confirmation. The hotel stated that check-in was 4pm-12am. We received a call from booking.com at 7pm the night of check-in to tell us that the hotel had “overbooked” and did not have a room available for us. They looked at other hotels that were “comparable” to what we paid and sent an e-mail stating they upgraded us from a 4-Star to a 5-Star hotel. I had them call the hotel to confirm and the hotel they recommended was booked as well. They ended referring me to a “Days Inn” and told me that the price for the night was double what I paid for the 4-Star hotel and they would cover the difference. The only problem is the Days Inn was a 2-Star hotel. Booking.com wanted me to pay the same amount for a 4-Star hotel and stay in a 2-Star hotel. When I asked them to find me another hotel regardless of the price, they said they couldn’t and that they were already “comping” me half the price of the cost for the Days Inn.  I had to ask to speak to a supervisor bc the gentleman I was speaking to said he couldn’t help me. We ended up cancelling our plans for the night and driving 3 hrs back home bc we didn’t have anywhere to stay for night!!!!! Will NEVER book with Booking.com again. At least we were able to drive home. I’d hate for this to happen to someone else who was “out-of-town” and had nowhere else to go.        	                1	1	Sunday	booking	negative

331	"            We booked an apartment in Basingstoke in July to stay near family. Received a call 5 minutes before check in time, after driving 24 hours to get to the flat, from the host saying that the apartment was unfurnished (!) so we couldn't stay in the home. He suggested hotel alternatives, but we had a car load of food prepared, and we wanted a self-catering apartment. We have been emailing/calling repeatedly ever since, and here we are, over 2 months later, and we have no refunds. Not for the non-existant unfurnished property, not to mention any form of reimbursement for food wasted, alternative accommodation found at the literal last minute. WHERE IS MY REFUND? No apologies, keep getting responses saying ""You will be refunded, please await an email with details for refund..."", this never arrives. Service has been useless, unhelpful, pathetic. So disgusted at the service, I will never touch booking.com again. Still awaiting £400+ refunds, two months later - absolute madness.        "	                2	1	Friday	booking	negative

334	            We booked HENDERSON Airport Residence, Negombo, Sri Lanka via booking.com based on the high percentage ratings.  Any bad reviews (&amp; there is enough to deter) are not easy to find. The feeling at this place after arrival, caused my husband to look again at the reviews &amp; he found the bad ones, BUT what was worse was the proprietor's RESPONSES to guest reviews.. they are undignified, unprofessional, intimidatingly insulting &amp; now I've learnt, he even BLATANTLY LIES. I have chosen NOT to read his response to my review. I contacted  booking.com &amp; brought to their intention the guest review RESPONSES &amp; they agreed not only that the responses were unacceptable, BUT ALSO that indeed I am wise NOT to read my own response.  I questioned them on WHY WAS IT THAT THE 'ALL REVIEWS' are NOT placed in DATE ORDER. Their reply was that they want to 'help' those potential guests looking for a last minute booking. WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL, SURELY, TO THOSE potential guests is where NOT TO STAY. To add to this, a few days later my review went onto Trip Advisor.. there too Henderson Airport Residence placed a response, which I saw just the start of.. he made up a story stating that 1 day after his response went onto booking.com, that I personally had left him voicemails using foul mouthed language. I did NOT &amp; have no desire to know the contact details of this person. Booking.com have been made aware, but only care about their own revenue.        	                6	1	Thursday	booking	neutral
335	            I booked a motel for one week for a job I was expecting; but had to cancel due to not being able to make it for the job due to personal reasons. I cancelled the booking, free of charge (according to booking.com); &amp; received a booking cancellation confirmation from booking.com &amp; confirmation I would not be charged.2 weeks later I get charged £335.33 from this motel. I contacted them - they had no notification from booking.com I had cancelled so had  charged me the booking cost. After I sent them a copy of the booking cancellation confirmation from booking.com, they refunded me.But I have still been charged a foreign transaction fee from my bank. I have lodged a complaint with booking.com over the unauthorised transaction - as it was cancelled, that is what it was - &amp; being charged an foreign transaction fee from my bank. They sent an inane email which blames the motel, &amp; asked for proof of the transaction; which I sent along with a screenshot of the booking cancellation confirmation email; with the demand that booking.com refund me the fee my bank charged. Haven't heard back from them, &amp; the London phone number just screams like a fax machine number 5 seconds then goes dead.Great.Worst customer service - I am never ever using them again - because this is my 3rd bad experience with booking.com. Update: After ignoring 7 emails I had a reply today asking for proof of transaction - despite 7 emails with email from the motel saying they hadn't known I had cancelled; copy of transaction clearly showing I had been charged &amp; the fees charged by my bank; &amp; the original booking cancellation confirmation from booking.com.AND they still are not acknowledging my complaint against THEM and still refusing to admit they didn't inform the motel of the cancellation!        	                6	1	Thursday	booking	negative

The day after we found out through another reviews site that it had a poor rating due to construction works going on next door and people saying the area wasn't safe to walk through.I rung up several times to see if I could get a free cancellation of this non-refundable room now I had found out all the information. I was left on hold for 10 ish minutes at a time whilst the agent tried to ring the hotel - to no avail. The 3rd person I spoke to said they weren't allowed to call the hotel regarding this matter. They basically passed the buck and said it was the hotel's policy to advertise a non-refundable room and they couldn't do anything to help with the matter.The hotel was just as useless with emails stating they couldn't make an exception and HAVE to follow their own policy every single time. They now know I won't be using the room and will have ample chance to book it again and make more money from it.Booking.com should be able to cancel this/force hotels to cancel the booking free of charge when new information not given at the time of booking comes to light.I usually would recommend but not sure I will now...        	                1	1	Thursday	booking	neutral

339	            I booked a holiday in September last year but got the wrong dates so cancelled it and rebooked the same hotel with the correct dates and shouldn’t of had a problem as it was free cancellation. 3 days before I was due to travel to the hotel I had a payment for half of the booking that was cancelled, the lady at the hotel said we were supposed to pay the rest of the balance even though we had already cancelled the previous booking under free cancellation. She was nice and waved the rest of the money but said that we should apologise to the manager and say that it was a mix up when we had already cancelled it months before under free cancellation. I have repeatedly phoned booking.com since July and am still waiting for my £300 back that I should have been refunded ages ago and shouldn’t have been charged in the first place. I advise everyone to go to their bank and you can claim it back as it is fraud and it’s trades descriptions. I am never booking with this company again and am shocked at their incompetence and lies that they keep telling me        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

341	            I booked a room with 'free cancellation' last weekend only to receive a conformation email stating the room was non refundable the next day, and to find out they had charged the full amount to my card. On trying to cancel I was told there was 'nothing they could do' and they frequently accused me of booking a non refundable room despite me paying the higher refundable amount. They try and pass the buck onto the hotel who of course try and pass the buck back to them, blaming each other or me whilst I am £261 down for a room I cannot use. Have always used them in the past but have lost all faith in the company, a completely misleading service.        	                3	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

When we entered the hotel we just as well could have walked into a hotel in the middle east. As being gay that is rather uncomftable and you don't feel safe. But booking.com won't accept that you feel unsafe as Gay person and write that in your review of the hotel and rate the hotel taking that into account. Earlier I would recommend using booking.com to others, now I'm not so sure anymore When they don't value my oppion because it is not positive.        	                2	2	Tuesday	booking	negative

Their solution was to offer me something 30 miles away at more than double the cost of the original booking and said if I send them the receipts they will consider helping with the additional cost. A supervisor would not speak to me as they decided my issue was not worth escalating, then they terminated my call. Will not be using them again.

The hotel proprietor (Asha?) did not respond to our 'Special Request' of arriving late. At 22:17, we discovered that the hotel was shut! This demonstrates that the hotel was never interested in letting us check in. Next day, the vile proprietor was resistant to any reasonable discussion. Furthermore, the proprietor was happy to keep our money AND book other people into our rooms whilst we were standing there! Plus, the hotel remains listed with Booking.com. Booking.com seems to be condoning the abuse of trusting tourists, by continuing to list hotels that do not provide a fair service. Finally, Booking.com Customer Services have been shocking in that no-one replies for days/weeks to emails.

About 4 months before the convention,it was switched to a larger Holiday Inn hotel.I tried to switch my booking with Holiday Inn,but was told I'd have to cancel through Booking.com.

This is truly unacceptable. I am not sure the name of this very very aggresive vile man, as my Mum is too kind a womem to argue and was shaken by this whole exoerience she did not ask his name. I ensure you i will be taking this much further. I have no idea who booking.com think they are, to phone three people who havent booked through them and TRY AND FORCE THEM TO LEAVE.

350	            I have used Booking.com for years and I have booked hundreds of hotel room nights through them.I have lots of loyalty points and I have 'genius' status....for the little its worth.Recently I have noticed that their pricing has become uncompetitive against other respected and well established hotel booking sites such as Expedia.Here's why I would say avoid Booking.com: I have emailed and called a number of times to complain that they are no longer competitive but they have absolutely zero customer service - weeks later I'm still waiting for my promised call back, or a response to one of my written requests for an explanation or reply. Booking.com clearly has no customer service so I would say AVOID and use someone else - if something goes seriously wrong with a booking I want a company with people who care and will help. Its a shame as Booking.com used to be good.....they can keep my loyalty points, and my 'genius' status, I'll be booking elsewhere from now.        	                2	1	Monday	booking	positive

355	            I reviewed the Henderson Airport Residence, Negombo, Sri Lanka after an unpleasant stay there, brought on purely by the owner, who was clearly more concerned about his review ratings, than his guests. Otherwise the place is acceptable (but in no way as great as the ratings).. but I can reveal the reason for the overly high ratings...What I did not expect was that the owner would resort to blatantly lies. The ratings show a high figure, but, as a guest, when one gets to read his responses, one sees a pattern of intimidating abusive responses to any reviewer who dare to mention even a slight negative. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A REVIEW OF THE PLACE, NOT OF THE GUEST. Also, booking.com have a bias of putting the higher ratings on top, rather than in date order (on my phone, it is virtually impossible to see the bad reviews). I questioned them on this .. their reply was that they are keen to try to help those that are looking for somwhere last minute to stay. In other words, they hide poor reviews from the unsuspecting guest.  As a result of my booking.com review on HENDERSON AIRPORT RESIDENCE, the owner blatantly lied about me personally at the start (that was all I read) of his response to my same review on Trip Advisor,  in the hope, no doubt that I would temove my review. I realised then, that his responses to other guests likely included lies too. My husband normally reviews places, but declined to do so here, because of the intimidating provocative response he would likely receive back. I phoned Booking.com, even though I had not &amp; have no intention of reading the response to my review with them. Even the booking.com rep agreed that I should not read the response, as it was insulting, indignant &amp; unprofessional, in their words. They also read other guest reviews &amp; those responses &amp; it was clear to them even that the owner was trying to fix the ratings. It seems the only way to remove the response is for me to remove my review .. but why should I fall into that trap, when I put a review on for the benefit of other potential guests &amp; those previous guests who suffered from an unpleasant stay there. I SUGGEST if one finds a place to stay via booking.com, DON'T book it with them, but go DIRECT to the hotel itself...it will be CHEAPER anyway.        	                2	1	Friday	booking	negative

357	            I wish I had checked other people's review before using their service.We had concerns about an apartment we were considering reserving and contacted Booking.com to check if they'd had any problems. We were assured it was legit and told that Booking.com would immediately resolve any issues that may occur.When we arrived the apartment simply didn't exist. We contacted Booking.com and their offer of assistance instantly vanished. We were told we couldn't cancel our booking because it was non-refundable, Booking.com seemed uninterested in the fact that the accommodation was non-existent. The advisor we spoke to was rude, accusatory and uninterested in helping us; we had to push to get an offer of further assistance to find alternative accommodation. The advisor offered to look into this for us but we didn't hear back from him.We sorted ourselves out for the first two nights of our trip then contacted Booking.com to see what was happening with the accommodation it was supposedly arranging. The only record Booking.com had was that we had 'canceled' our reservation. We then had to go through the whole process again and eventually Booking.com accepted that the matter had been handled poorly and would look into what it could do and call us back. To be fair, it did call us back, unfortunately, its proposed solution was that we find our own accommodation. I explained I wanted to make a complaint and Booking.com told me that it would open one and I could provide further information when I returned to the UK the following week. I submitted further information to Booking.com and it told me it had closed my complaint as it thought I did not want to take further action. So far, I've sent about eight emails over two months trying to resolve this. Booking.com have refunded me the money I spent on phone calls, but have refused to address any of the issues in my complaint; ignored requests for a manager to contact me; or, provided information about its complaint policies. It is my strongest recommendation that you don't consider using their service. They just don't care about their customers        	                4	1	Friday	booking	negative

360	"            I had a terrible experience with Booking.com in Thailand. They cancelled a hotel reservation I had made and fully paid for, three days before my arrival, claiming that the cancellation was made by the hotel due to ""onsite works in progress"". They offered me a different hotel or a full refund. I chose the full refund, and had to correspond with Booking.com for over a month (during my holiday!) before receiving the refund. It turned out that the cancellation was not made by the hotel (I went there myself, there were no onsite works and they knew nothing about the cancellation) but by the local booking.com representative, who apparently had some dealing with the alternative hotel offered. Booking,com took no responsibility for this fraudulent conduct by their representative. I strongly recommend not to book through Booking.com, but directly with the hotel (or through a different booking company).        "	                1	1	Thursday	booking	negative

Then went back to room quickly change and head out for food to see Florence before heading to Rome. Got back and took off shoes to the feeling of the floor being wet. We located the smell!!!damp all in the carpet and what looked like Mold. We are both asthmatic and Complained and after some arguing we were moved to another room which we were told was two double beds. WRONG AGAIN! Slightly bigger than a single. We are a married couple trying to enjoy some rare time away together in years and it has been completely ruined by this so called four star hotel. I seriously wouldn’t let my animals stay here. I will post all pics with this review on trip adviser. No manager Available. Will be reporting this to health and safety also as Surely this cannot be right. Absolutely devastated. Even after saying we didn’t want the second room and just wanted a refund and leave we were told we would still be charged regardless. No customer service skills.

363	            There are two apartments called Midtown Apts and Midtown Luxury Apts nearly just around the corner from each other unbeknown to me. On booking I booked what I thought was the apartment with terrace and pool for my son as he has not been well and this was to save us money on having to travel and allow him to relax. Unfortunately it was not the apartment I booked. The apartment told me that this was a court case because of name and was the cause of confusion for customers and that is why it went to court. I told Booking.com they denied any knowledge and told me this was not for them to know but they are advertising and surely should have made customers aware as apartment said this was causing customers confusion.The whole point of wanting an apartment with terrace and pool was to avoid what I eventually had to do which was I had to take my son down by taxi to the beach thus paying for lounger and parasol for him to relax. This started to cost me more than I anticipated.On arrival at the apartment my daughter had switched on the hairdryer which went up in blue light and she could have been electrocuted it was a cleaner as no one else was available to deal with and she said oh yes it is broken it was in bits inside and this could have had tragic consequences. I was made to feel I was complaining about nothing there was no apology. We were held back for 2 hours after our arrival between this and the safe which did not work we were told to wait as someone had locked it.The next thing was the chair which wobbled when i sat on it I nearly fell as leg was loose so had put it in corner spoke again to cleaner again she said yes it moves she said Manager not coming up about any of the above.The apartment had aircon on when we arrived at the apartment which we thought was great but we were unaware of the reason behind this. The smell of sewers to which an email from apt said they would put something down drain which they did not The next thing the shower had been hanging unbalanced on a half intact holder. Eventually it fell off banging me in shower. I again had to complain about shower needing sorted also mentioned about drain smell.Also the noise from the pub downstairs kept us awake we never got falling asleep until 3am my sister n law was a few streets up and it was a quiet street. We were out when the shower was fixed. When the girl eventually came up to the apartment when I was at the shop on Friday after us asking someone to come about the smell in the apartment. She had put on aircon and sprayed something which she left for me to use on my return. I asked to see her when I came back and she said I am only the receptionist and I asked why do we not see the Manager only the cleaner or you she did not reply. I asked what she had sprayed she would not tell me what it was but that there is no smell and I said because you have put on aircon and sprayed something. Eventually the manager came up and was very angry asking what my problem was that she could not smell anything I told her that she had said they were putting something down drain when sorting the shower she cut me off shouting at me and told me nothing wrong with the drains it is my food but she had already told me she could not smell anything she contradicted herself. She walked to the shower room saying your shower is fixed what are you talking about. I asked her to listen to what I was saying and that I knew the shower was sorted she kept shouting at me. I tried to calm her and say I do not want to fall out. My son said we want a full refund after she said leave the apartment tomorrow and he meant a full refund from then but she said to him are you thick. I told her I wanted no argument and she told me your food causing this smell. We were eating out every day so only had cereal milk bread and margarine our bin only held empty bottles and i took lid off showed her and she waved me away. She is such an ignorant woman.I spent every day onto Booking.com and my bill today after calling 02 is £68.00.I spoke to a woman from Booking.com on Friday I was so upset she was no help whatsoever and told me I have to look after the Apartment owner too as they are also our customers. She told me owner wanted me out the next morning I cried as where were we to go. She then came back to me saying you can only stay if you stop complaining. After her call suddenly there were noises from the attic which we had been told by cleaner was empty and the noises continued through every room. My daughter and I were both in tears and scared and did not know what to do. I had again called Booking.com trying to leave a message for Christos who had been our only bit of help through this nightmare. Christos eventually called back and at that the noises stopped I swear someone was listening to me and my calls. He told us you can leave and get refund of 734 I asked how am I supposed to get another accommodation I had no money. He emailed her we were leaving we did not feel safe there. We had to go sit in Sants Station until the morning as I had to wait till morning until a family member sent me money for another accommodation. Our safety was not a priority obviously. We booked Catelonia Barcelona Plaza which Booking.com advertised but I would not book through them again. We were made to feel welcome in the hotel which had a ll the amenities we had wanted all along.I sent photos of everywhere in the apartment when cleaned and we were leaving to prove the condition left in so Midtown would not take 300 from my card for deposit/damages.I am so much out of pocket.Midtown Luxury Apartment charged me £221.55 on 3.7.18 to confirm booking as price per nightI have finally spoken to Christina who eventually put me on hold for customer complaint and cut me off at 17.43pm.This needs sorted.It needs urgent action I was told I get refund 300 deposit would  be refunded which it has not been.Booking.com do not deal with their serious complaints and I am left by £68.00 out of pocket by phone charges.Oh and surprisingly when emailed CEO of Booking.com NO RESPONSE EITHER...        	                13	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

We couldn’t have ashower, get ready for the day or even going to the toilet as thetoilet wasn’t flushing (Video attached below as evidence). We had togo to a local beach club for a shower every morning and evening justto get ready which was very inconvenient. The internet was down whichmeans we couldn’t plan our day or contact anyone. The reason why wehad to book this hotel very last minute is because our originalbooking (Tapa TepiKali) was cancelled the day before check-in. Wewere never informed by Booking.com and weren’t aware of the situationuntil the hotel contacted us directly via WhatsApp. The situation hadreally stressed us out as we were informed the day before check-inand we had no clue where we could stay. Please bare in mind, thebooking was made 10 days in advance which gives [1]booking.com plentyof time to contact us but neither of us were informed due to the lackof communication and organisation skills. It was extremely difficultfor us to book somewhere we both like last minute as a lot of placeswere fully booked or overpriced because of the peak season. One ofyour advisors have refused to refund me the differences on the nextbooking, therefore we had to book somewhere that was not up to ourstandards and resulted in no water and internet supply for two days.I have just spoken to one of your advisors named “Renske” from theCambridge office and she said the most she’d offer us is £30compensation which I did not accept because that is disrespectful.£30 compensation after the amount of stress the company has put usthrough? We were away for our anniversary and somewhere like Bali isa very special place and the last thing that we wanted wasunnecessary stress whilst we were on our vacation. She has clarifiedconfidentially that I will not receive my full refund because anearthquake is a natural disaster. I’m sorry but we have stayed at sixdifferent hotels/ villas and they were all absolutely fine. We havevisited “Tapa Tepi Kali” because they offered us a full body massageas compensation and their hotel was absolutely fine, they had water,Wi-Fi and operating as normal. This was our original booking which weboth actually liked and we could have stayed there if there wasn’t ahuman or technical error may I add.There was an earthquake is not an excuse, you do not advertise thehotel online when it is not operating properly and doesn’t evenhave the essentials that a hotel should have and try to takeconsumers’ money. Let’s put it this way, would you pay £95 for twonights in Bali if you knew there wasn’t water and Wi-Fi? I wouldn’tthink so. Hotels.com and Expedia have both managed to contact usdirectly about the damages at the properties that we were supposedto stay at and refunded us the full amount without questioning andhave offered us alternatives. Why didn’t Booking.com do this? Itdoesn’t matter if there was an earthquake and we have to relocatebut you must make sure the consumers are aware of the situation,not just presume everything’s fine, we’ve taken their payment now,so it doesn’t really matter if there’s no internet or water for twodays. Using earthquake as a reason for poor customer services is anexcuse. We wouldn’t have known the booking was cancelled if thehotel didn’t contact us directly via WhatsApp. From what I’m awareof, there was an earthquake near Bali, not the UK. Why did you notcontact us regarding the cancellation? Why did you not offer torefund the differences? Why did you not inform us when the hotelwas affected by an “earthquake” and there was no water and Wi-Fisupply? Why weren’t you apologetic but rude when I rung andcomplained? And most importantly why did you have to ruin ourvacation at such an amazing place?I can confidently say I will not book another stay with[2]booking.com again and I will do my best to make sure my family andfriends will not book another accommodation with you again due toyour unprofessionalism and poor manners.        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	negative
371	            Awful experience accommodation took £849 out of my bank account. I tried contact them direct by phone and email no response. Complained to booking.com as booked through them and absolutely no help at all. Would never book through them again. Still no money back despite cancelling booking.        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	negative
372	            I have been a booking.com user for years and I am some sort of super wordsmith genius according to their hierarchy. But when something does go wrong, they will fail you and steal from you. A few days ago, for the first time, a hotel in Wash DC did not honor my booking.com reservation. Moreover, it was one of those low cost no money back reservations. Moreover, it was 2 am, I had my daughter with me, there was nowhere else to go. They basically were about to make me homeless despite the fact that I had already been charged for the stay!!. The hotel itself offered an alternative hotel, and to cover the charges so rate stays the same. however it quickly turned into a scam, as the alternative hotel charged me 105 dollars pet fee -- which would have been 15 dollars at the original hotel. When I found out the alternative hotel had the pet fee, I called booking.com -- BEFORE going there -at almost 3 am -- and I said, I am not paying this. Booking.com was very apologetic and promised a refund of the extra fee. They can offer me NOTHING else in DC that night, he said, just pay the fee and we will reimburse you. Well that was a LIE designed to BAIT me to spend the money and go away. After I submitted the receipt to them they offered... that's right 8.84 cents without even any explanation!!!! They basically themselves had NO SOLUTION to us having paid but yet being left on the street at 2 am, and then NO solution to us being overcharged 90 dollars, and then they LIED to get us to accept the alternative and stop calling and then refused to honour their promise of refund. Thank you (not) for 10 years of service Booking.com. You always think you ear some degree of respect but apparently not.        	                5	1	Tuesday	booking	negative
373	            I like to book my accommodation with booking.com. I feel safe and secure if something unforeseen happens at the hotel, I know booking.com will sort it out for me. Prices are always close to the best available on the market. I prefer to book on this site rather than going with agoda / Airbnb etc. The only downside is that how they urge you to book stating that how many people booked in the last few hours and how prices will increase if you don’t - I find this method a bit pushy and borderline lie. Overall I used 10+ times and I can only recommend        	                4	4	Tuesday	booking	positive
374	            Booked for the horse trials at Burleigh house September 2019! Year in advance. Got a booking number after leaving card details. Then the owner of the property decided he wanted to double the price and have a four day minimum (Pea Cottage Stamford). We asked booking.com to step in as they say they guarantee a replacement property of the same standard or better. The difference was supposed to be charged to the original property. However in reality you have to pay the full cost of the new property and then they will try and help you gain a refund!!!! Cost me over £40 in phone bills calling their line to resolve and then will not guarantee in writing we will get the refund. Also the property is eight miles from Stamford meaning a drive which we wanted to avoid. All together quite upset with the whole thing and have cancelled as too much worry and uncertainty. They say the right thing on the phone but won’t commit in writing.        	                15	1	Monday	booking	positive
375	            Despite some bad reviews, I have had good experiences with booking.I have been using booking for a long time and everything goes fine.I had one problem once, the hotel did not have WiFi or Gym, as announced, and I refused to stay and booked other hotel. However they had charged my credit card and told me they would refund the Money but they never did. I contacted booking twice. The first call I got someone a little rude and did not solve my problem, The second call, was really helpfull and they put some pressure on the hotel and, as they were not refunding me, they suspended their booking account until I got my Money back. I don't remember the name of the person who dealt with this situation but I am very thankfull for all his effort and attention to solve my problem!        	                6	5	Monday	booking	negative

377	            We called up Booking.com customer service after unforeseen circumstances put us in a major dilemma, with only a few days to go until our wedding.Marissa, the customer service rep we spoke to, smoothed everything over, helping us change our reservations quickly and easily. Her customer service was faultless, which really puts my mind at ease when considering going through booking.com in future.        	                1	5	Sunday	booking	positive
378	            Both Booking.com and G. George Hotel in Nidri, Lefkada, Greece disreputable. Hotel immediately deducted full charge (5 days) from bank account, upon booking. We learned this when we tried to cancel, 5 days after booking, and over 2 months prior to our reservation dates. Miniscule print which we subsequently saw, gives hotel the right to do this, although everywhere else on the site, blares free cancellation (which held true for all other bookings). When we arrived, hotel room did not have requested (from 2 months earlier) balcony or mountain or pool view. Staff rude.  We stayed elsewhere.When we complained to Booking.com- I never got a reply. My friend was offered less than 1/2 what the hotel charged us. Worse, when we complained to Booking.com about G. George, the hotel staff flagrantly lied to Booking.com agent about what hotel had offered us. G. George never answered my letter. Moreover, we could not leave review on either Booking.com site or G. George site because their bogus policy says to leave a review, you have to stay at the hotel. We couldn't stay, and wouldn't. The hotel staff was rude and dishonest - and the room offered was not as described.        	                1	1	Saturday	booking	negative
379	            If you could give 0 stars I would as they don't even deserve the 1. Wow where do I start. One of the worst customer service I have ever come across in my life. What an absolute shamble of a company. This  company are absolute scammers that take money out of your account before you even blink but cannot return it to their customers.I booked an apartment that looked nothing like what it did on the site. Upon getting to the apartment I told them I would not be staying there as quiet frankly it looked like a brothel. I took pictures as evidence and sent all this to booking.com as this is what they asked for when I made my initial complaint. It has been a month and a half and I still have not recieved my refund and was told booking.com don't get paid for these bookings. Haha is that a joke or what? Booking.com have have over 10 million in 2016. Yes I researched the company figures from 17 aren't out so how can I be told that booking.com don't make commission  from bookings. That is an absolute  absurd comment to even make.I made numerous calls, spoke to numerous people saying the same thing again and again and again and I'm bored now. I will never ever ever use this company again. I have so much more to say but i can't even be bothered they don't deserve the time. AVOID THIS COMPANY.        	                3	1	Saturday	booking	neutral
380	"            Booked into Proper Suites@Empire Damansara in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia. The property manager, unable to contact me for payment decided to just unlock the room door to gain entry. My partner who was alone in the room and in the shower at that time was shocked and panicked as the bathroom door has no lock. Fortunately the door was latched and she immediately rushed out and closed the door yelling at them to stop and settle it with me the next day as I was not there. But still they insisted on trying to gain entry to the point she had to pushed the fridge against the door.Complaint was lodged to Booking.com and when investigated, they said the property management did so on the pretext to ensure my safety and everything is ok. So apparently they saw a need to force entry to ensure my safety when I had not paid up and even when told not to come in. How thoughtful. I say this is an outright violation of privacy.It was very clearly stated in Booking.com's accommodation agreement that they have the right to terminate their contract with an accommodation after receiving a serious customer complaint like this. But disappointingly they had decided to side with the property and refuse to make them accountable. They reasoned that they cannot do so when the property had taken such an action with the intention to ensure my safety.So it seems to me whatever action taken by their accommodations, whether it was done properly or not, whether with malicious or good intent, as long as it is ""to ensure safety of guests"" it will be deemed acceptable.I am totally appalled. Booking.com has no credibility and do not expect them to place your well-being and safety as priority as a guest. Please stay away from them.        "	                2	1	Saturday	booking	positive
381	            Have always used booking.com but never again! Booked an apartment in Stuttgart, followed the rules which said to contact owner before to say what time you would arrive. He asked me to phone him an hour before. His number was engaged so sent a text. Arrived at property he was a no show! He wouldn’t answer his phone on my number so my husband called. He said he would be 2 hours but maybe 4. When I told him I wasn’t standing on a street corner with 2 kids in 30• heat he then told me his English wasn’t good? Tried to phone booking.com but received an automated answer saying they were experiencing high call volumes and to look on their website. Ended up Having to find other accommodation. Phoned booking.com and was told the owner did show up later so there was nothing they could do? Explained we had arrived at agreed time- he was wrong they still said no. I sent photographic evidence of us being there, my calls etc and I was given €25. A complete insult. Not only did i loose out on the accommodation we never got into, we had to find other accommodation. Will never use them again as they were completely useless when things go wrong.        	                2	1	Saturday	booking	negative

Got cancelation confirmation saying a refund would be made within 7 -15 days...... Waited 16 days No refund So rang them. OMG they informed me that the hotels policy was to charge a cancelation fee equivalent to the booking Cost When I explained that the booking was an error in the system and that they had emailed me confirmation of a full refund they blamed the hotel.I rang the hotel directly explained the situation and the chap told me that not only had they never taken payment, they also would have refunded in full if they had and did not charge for doing so!!!

384	            A shocking excuse of a company. They send out 'deals' to their customers then back out on the deal after the customer has paid with them refusing to refund the money promised.

385	            I have been a regular and loyal customer of theirs for many years now, and have always chosen booking.com as my first option to book accommodation when abroad.I have recommended their website as the one to go to, with countless friends, colleagues &amp; family members.I travel very often, both for business and pleasure, and have never before the month of August 2018 had one single issue with this company.This is the reason why I chose to book through booking.com. Simply because it is reliable and hassle-free...or so I thought.My friends and I (a group of 7 in total) have planned a month long vacation in Asia in August of this year. We booked our accommodation with them at least 9 months in advance of our trip, to make sure that we chose the properties we liked, at the best prices we could get them at.Out of the 6 properties we booked, 3 of them were cancelled by the properties. That is half of them, 50%.The first cancellation happened a few days before we left, the second whilst we were already travelling, and the third (appallingly) one minute after we landed and were bound to leave the airport for the apartment.As you can imagine, this has caused us a great deal of stress and inconvenience.Not to mention, that we ended up spending more money than we had budgeted for, as all the properties were more expensive than what we had originally booked.It also goes without saying, that we had to settle for properties which were of far inferior quality to the ones we had originally booked.The last thing you want whilst on holiday, is to have to think about where to sleep in the next few days, especially after having carefully planned everything in advance.Booking.com promised me a refund for the difference we paid in accommodation expenses. So far, we only received a mere €14 out of approx €260 that we are owed in total.When I sent my complaint to them, all I got was a lousy email reply full of excuses, and not even a trace or form of compensation.Now, they are not even replying to my emails anymore.To add insult to injury; however, they keep sending me customer satisfaction surveys....goes to show they can't even get their systems to talk to each other properly, let alone give a semblance of service to their customers.Shameful &amp; disgraceful....with this service and all the competition out there, it's unbelievable that they're still in business.        	                3	1	Thursday	booking	positive

387	            Hi. I have been using booking.com for over 1 year now and made a few bookings with them. All went well until my last experience. I booked a house for Christmas in Austria. When I looked it online I have noticed that the same house was cheaper on Airbnb with about 150€. Because I don't like to change service providers and conditioned by the fact that on their website says they do price match I booked it on booking.com knowing that I will get the difference back. On both websites were the same dates, same no of people and same house. When I called booking.com to get my difference I spoke to a really nice lad who, after checking with his manager informed me that I will not get the difference back as the cancellation terms were not completely identical with the ones from Booking.com. I told them I am not interested in the cancellation policy as I am not canceling a property with them, I am booking one for which I was promissed a price matche. And for the purpose of the argument, the difference on Airbnb is that if you cancel the booking you dont get refunded their fees but you get back the rest of the amount. I feel that I was mislead by their false advertising and I am considering to close my account with them as I cant see how I can trust them anymore. I am curious if someone will answer to this or do something about it. Hope this is useful for others. If something changes I will keep you posted. CheersI wanted to edit this review because I promised I will get back with an update. Booking.com came back to their senses and offered me the price match. Even if I don't appreciate the hassle of having to go through this I have to give it to them in the end and say they were fair, eventually. So I will stick with them, as they are pretty good in general.        	                1	4	Wednesday	booking	positive
388	            Worst customer journey ever!I have been a reoccurring customer of Booking. Com for 10+ years and have continued to use their site as I've found it close effective and convenient.My most recent experience has been beyond bad, I booked a 1 week holiday nearly 3 weeks ago, a couple of days later £525 left my account yet the very next day I received an email stating that my booking had been cancelled due to their being insufficient funds in my account. I subsequently called booking. Com and they called the hotel before revealing that the front desk had taken the payment and not communicated with finance who later tried to take a further £525. The Spanish Hotel admitted the error was theirs and therefore offered to reinstate the booking, I decided against this and explained I would like a refund given that I had no confidence in this hotel. I then instructed Booking. Com to request that my funds be returned, after a further week and no communication I made a further call to Booking. Com and was told that I'd be refunded 100 euros for all of the messing around. After a further 7 phone calls and no updates as promised 4 times I was eventually told this Evening that the hotel have finally said they'll refund the £525 but it'll take up to 7 working days. I then queried the 100 euros offered to me 2 weeks ago as a gesture if goodwill and they stated that they'd sent me an email to which I needed to reply with further details to allow any compensation to be paid (At no point was this ever communicated) So to finally summarise its been just shy of 3 weeks, I've had 8 conversations totalling to over 4 hours on the phone, agents have disconnected the call on me 4 times even though I've some how remained perfectly calm and the 2 times I've asked to speak to a manager I've been told that there isn't any in the office which is ridiculous and clearly untrue... Did I forget to mention I'm still out of pocket £525 and had to book another hotel. Terrible customer journey, no understanding of how to treat customers fairly and quite simply a shambles.**********UPDATE***************SO we're now a month in and I haven't received my refund from the Spanish Hotel as promised, Booking.com requested that they provide evidence of the refund and this surprisingly has never materialised.. So this Evening finally booking.com said if they haven't had this confirmation within 24 hours they'll refund me directly, so here's the best part.. Booking. Com state that because they're so busy it could take up to 20 further days for me to recurve my refund back from them??So to further summarise I'm likely to have waited 50 days for a refund. Got to big for their boots and can no longer treat customers fairly or offer a satisfactory level of service. Would anyone reccoment Kayak?

Room very dirty, very mouldy, not as described( not carpeted) , unsafe ( accessible to all hotel guests) and dangerous (nails sticking through floor). Told if we left we'd still have to pay as we agreed  we could only cancel 24hrs before arrival through Booking.com! Complained every day but nothing got better. Refused to pay full amount so payed cash, as hadn't given them card details. They took remainder off our card through Booking.com. Booking.com said we had agreed to stay there, and had stayed there (even though not as described). We sent complaint and photos to Booking.com but they lost them and said they couldn't get compensation from hotel as we should have complained at hotel, shouldn't have paid full amount and should have sent them photo proof.

393	            Booking.com accepted a reservation for a hotel booking with a credit card to guarantee the reservation. Within days, Booking.com allowed the hotel to contact me directly, stating that if payment was not made into their bank account 48 hours prior to the reservation date, the reservation would be cancelled. However, the hotel provided no bank details and did not respond to an e-mail asking for the details. The hotel also never responded to any attempts to contact them by telephone, so I assumed the reservation would be cancelled. The day following the reservation, the hotel took credit card payment for the reservation claiming not only that I was a 'no show' but also that they had in fact had a telephone conversation with me regarding arrival times and dinner reservations. Despite providing Booking.com evidence to disprove the dishonest conduct of the hotel, they proceeded to process payment to the hotel, stating that Booking.com's policy was to guarantee the booking using a credit card. If this was the case, why did Booking.com send me information to the contrary? (The message was sent on a Booking.com e-mail). Booking.com eventually accepted a measure of responsibility by offering me half of the amount they had taken but this was only after constant chasing and it fell far short of a full refund, which is what I believe I have been scammed for. The company is either in collusion with hotels or exercises no control over the actions of the hotels regarding customer bookings, ie. there is very little actual booking behind Booking.com. The company's terrible attitude to customer service is probably endemic of the size it has quickly become but I would urge anybody attempting to book accommodation to use a competitor, such as Hotels.com, with which I have had nothing but positive experiences in the past.        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

In August my booking was cancelled for no reason.  Current rooms and apartments are only available for a multiple of the original price.  Booking.com is not interested in all this.

397	            Terrible if you have a property you want to list with them.We have had our property with Airbnb for 4 yrs.  This year we decided to put it on booking.com as well.  Property went up with the wrong address, listing our home address as the property address.  We picked up the problem immediately, wrote to booking.com to advise them of the problem and to ask them to change the address to the correct one (they didn’t), wrote to everyone who booked to advise them the address is incorrect and to give them the correct address which is in a different country altogether (all this on the same day).  4 months later we get an invoice from booking.com to compensate one of the people who booked, because we “they incurred costs since we declined their booking due to overbooking”.  Hmmmm.  Do booking.com processes rely on post-it notes so if one flies out the window they just grab another random one and stick it to a case?  But that’s not the end of it. We wrote to every single customer service address to advise their records are incorrect.  No reply.  Followed the process on their website to send an internal message – “an unexpected error occurred”.   My experience - their records leave a lot to be desired and their customer services are non-existent.        	                2	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

However I booked a hotel in Canada and on bookings website it stated free breakfast, free parking and the price was 216. When I arrived at the hotel NOTHING was free and they charged me 120 more than what they stated on their website. I will not use booking.com again.

I presented them proof, they don't care, property is still listed despite other reviews stating the same problem. Skewed review system, they don't let you manually enter a rating but rather calculate one on your input. And even then they don't let half of the bad reviews pass.

402	            Very poor. My partner booked one room type and they confirmed a different room of a lesser standard for the same price, no reduction. Booking.com claim it’s not their fault so speak to the hotel, the hotel claim booking is made through booking.com so they should deal with it!!!!! No one wants to do their job. All too common in this day and age, everyone wants to rip you off.Customer service then cut you off as they can’t and call you a liar stating you booking a lesser room for that price.

404	            We used booking.com to book a hotel in New York approximately eight months before arriving. The hotel WAS called the Magnuson convention centre when booked, on arrival it had changed its name to Midtown convention centre. On arrival the hotel did not in anyway meet the reviews stated by booking.com. Infact it was the worst hotel I have ever experienced. The hotel was, in a word was “disgraceful”. Mould, faulty electrical items, filthy carpets and walls. Seaman, urine, blood and excrement stains on the bedding along with pubic hairs. We immediately left but could not get all our money back due to actually stepping foot in the room. We called booking.com from New York and they could/would not do anything. We had to find alternative accommodation and lost sum £500 due to their lack of accurate reviews. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.        	                1	1	Monday	booking	negative
405	            Booked our stay in Sweden through booking.com. Had  to check out a day early and advised booking.com about this in plenty of time. Despite their claim of giving refunds, they said the hotel would have to deal with it. On arrival at the hotel, and payment up front they said the changes had to be made by booking.com as the hotel had pre-paid them for the rooms (2). I have since emailed booking.com on a number of occasions and haven't even had a reply. They still owe me the refund and I will seek advise on taking the matter further. I will certainly never use them again and would strongly advise anyone I know to avoid them.        	                5	1	Monday	booking	positive

408	            Booking.com advertised a 'hotel' which was not fit to take guests. The hotel was closed when we arrived and we had to book an alternative hotel at the last minute, at a considerably higher cost.  Booking.com refused to refund us for the first hotel but luckily I had paid using Paypal and raised a Paypal dispute. Booking.com did not even respond to the Paypal dispute and so I got my refund, but I felt that the level of backup and support from Booking.com was absolutely non-existent. They clearly do not even assess the properties they advertise. I would steer clear of using them from now on.        	                1	1	Monday	booking	positive

The 1st hotel rung us saying they were full after we had paid and explained this had happened before... the 2nd there was a sprung mattress and bunk beds in the smallest of rooms (advertised as spacious as booked for wedding preparations) that we fell over the beds literally!! And 3rd (as a mini moon treat) we paid for a spacious '5*' rated(whoever rated them was paid well) hotel with bath that A) had no bath and B) stunk and was dirty!!

414	            Naughty naughty more booking dot Hmmmm than yea.   The terms bait and switch do come to mind ... a little at least, for when I went down this morning I was told that out my three day booking only one day (the second) qualified for free full breakfast even though at the time of booking the with full breakfast checkbox seemed to indicate that this would be the case on all three days and one would think that if this was not the case I would have been made clearly aware of this.Imagine my embarrassment when I went down for breakfast only to be told nicely that I did not qualify for a free breakfast today but tomorrow was ok (no soup for you or bacon or toast ...just joking)  I was looking forward to tucking in but oh no not today.    So Booking.com come on really! not a good practice and is more that a little unfair on the hotel as it could have a negative impact on their reputation but to be honest the Aspect hotel in Kilkenny Ireland is an excellent hotel , friendly helpful staff room spotlessly clean free wifi (excellen speed ) etc.        	                9	2	Friday	booking	positive
415	            Absolutely shocking. My friend booked an apartment in Whitechapel for me and him for my birthday 3/4 weeks before the date we was going, this was for a 2 day music festival we was attending a few miles away.I drove the 1 hour and 20 minutes there on the morning of the booking. When we arrived we was greeted to a door that we couldn't enter and had to call the apartment company who immediately gave off a shady vibe. They then wanted our ID's emailed over (why was this not requested well in advance), 2 minutes after this they demanded a £250 deposit (again why was this not requested well in advance). Then 2 minutes after taking £250 deposit they decided that because the booking was in my friends name and he wasn't 25 or over, we couldn't stay there (why take the deposit after you've literally just checked out ID's?!!). This is not clearly stated anywhere on booking.com and it was only found after scrolling through a load of small print! It was a non-refundable booking so we lost our £220.50. Then because they took £250 deposit AFTER checking our ID's we had no money to book anywhere else so I HAD TO SLEEP IN MY CAR ON MY BIRTHDAY RIGHT OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT WE'D PAID HARD EARNED MONEY TO STAY IN! I then couldn't attend the second day of the festival completely ruining my birthday weekend and everyone's plans for the people that were coming to see me on day 2 of the festival resulting in 4 people not going and losing £55 each for the tickets they had each bought.I am 31 years old so why they couldn't just change the booking to my name is a mystery. Almost as if they was banking on the non-refundable terms and just wanted to take money off of us. The woman on booking.com even agreed that it would have taken a few minutes to change the name on the booking. Also why is there nothing asking that you verify you are the correct age to book this place before being allowed to complete the booking reservation taking peoples money? It says people under 16 have to pay £20 extra per night to stay but if you're under 25 you can stay but you can't be the one that books... Makes no sense at all. For a company as big as bookings.com I find this absolutely disgusting practice and to even advertise these cowboy companies on their site is a joke as well. I can only wonder how many people have also been stung like we have.In total we are £330.50 down, but hey it's all good as booking.com offered us a whopping 25 EUROS. YES 25 AND YES EUROS!!! WE LIVE IN ENGLAND WE DON'T EVEN USE EUROS. If I could have rated them 0 stars I would have!Absolute disgrace!!!        	                1	1	Friday	booking	positive

417	            I booked eight hotels through them for a holiday and became what they class as GENIUS status I got emails from them after checking out of each hotel telling me I had earned a 'reward' (10% cashback) and each reward was being processed and would receive it in about 30 days. I received the first one, the cheapest stay en-route (booked for a quick overnighter). When asked (4 emails to get a response) about the others was told they didn't qualify as I had received the first one!  There was no mention of this originally and I had no choice in the matter ( would have chosen one that was four times more than first). Althopugh they do have a very wide choice of accommodations world-wide I think I'll be checking other booking sites in future and I suppose I should have done that in first place!!        	                3	1	Thursday	booking	positive
418	"            Everything flows smoothly when the accommodation you booked via Booking.com is decent. But the real challenge for a company like this is when problems appear. Well, Booking.com has a very poor customer service, if any... I do not know if it runs for the hotels, b&amp;bs e.t.c. and not for the visitors like me, but my forever last experience was awful.Anyway, the fact that they answer to your emails does not mean you can call it Support.Do not count on mediators like Booking.com. My experience was the following. The conclusion is yours to make.Before reservation, I requested info regarding the private parking because I was traveling by my own car. The hotel reassured me that there is actually a private parking but they did not mention that access would to it would be impossible. We showed up on time for check- in and after pressure by the HIGHLY IRONIC receptionist  plus several attempts, we tried to get the car inside the parking area. The result was that we broke the bottom of the car to get it inside the parking so after that, we asked for a cancellation because it would be impossible to do this even one more time - we would smash the car. We left the accommodation disappointed as we experienced only rudeness. After several emails to Booking.com they answered that the hotel has categorized my booking as ""no show up"" so they can do nothing for me to get a refund. They did nothing to help me or contact the hotel to find a solution. I stayed there 0 hours and charged me 7 days, even though the hotel misinformed me on parking.Apart from losing my money the most important thing was that in this way it was impossible to write a review on the hotel and inform other customers on my experience.The hotel was 100% protected and I was ""discarded like an old beer can"".Extreme malpractice.

419	            Be smart, DO NOT use Booking.com. I was charged almost $500 for a room that I never completed booking, never received any emails about, and obviously never had a confirmation number for. When I called Booking.com I was told that the hotel had been cancelled, even stating what day I called to cancel (even that was incorrect), then the operator disconnected the call and called me back from a London phone number. He then told me that there was nothing he could do because the hotel was canceled for a no-show even though he had already stated that I had previously cancelled  the room that I never booked. Everything about the situation, and dealing with them and the hotel manager, has been questionable &amp; unprofessional. I have spoken to my bank and am filing a claim against both parties.

421	            We stayed in Bay View resort, PhiPhi islands on 17th - 19th August, 2018 and wrote a detailed review on the property. However, after 7 days booking.com mailed me saying that my review didn't follow their guideline and it needs to be changed for them to publish it on their website. So, after that I had to completely change my review and eventually it was put on the website. But the most disgusting part is that they only put the score (which is 5.4 after booking.com repeatedly coerced me to change it to, originally I had put 2.5) and the description is all gone. Booking.com chose to take side with the property as they probably make a lot of money from them.Here is my original review of The Bay View Resort, PhiPhi islands:What I liked:Nothing 🤮P.S This is not my original review, booking dot com has forced me to change it, otherwise they would not publish it on their site.What I didn't like:We booked their Superior double bed garden side and was initially given a room (A501)that looked nothing like the photos on booking.com; everything in the room was old and broken down. The closest had broken door, the safety box was non functional, ac was blowing hot air, intercom was difficult to hear anything through it, WiFi wasn’t working, shower not working. The balcony had chairs that was probably as old asmy father. Worst was the location, which was on top of the hill and was not possible to commute to the beach without a shuttle car. We requested to change the room and was told there is no room in the same category, had to pay 15 usd per night extra to move to a liveable room.The staffs are poorly trained and very unfriendly with rude attitude. During checkout they wouldn’t send their shuttle car to pickup our luggage although there was thunderstorms outside, as a result we had to wait over 50 mins to go to the lobby and was at a risk of missing our ferry to Krabi. They told us to walk, unimaginably audacious and the worst customer service we have ever seen!!The transfer from Tonsai pier to the hotel is a joke; they use longboats and prepare to get half wet at that time. I would never go back to this shithole again and would advise anyone to stay there as there are plenty of hotels around with better location, facilities and staff.My score: 2.5#BayViewResort #phiphiislands #krabi        	                2	1	Thursday	booking	negative

Checked on booking.com and the website had changed to perfect for families with kids and the prices had dropped , no mention of perfect for couples.Talking with some of the others around the pool it  who were regulars it was apparent that the clientele had changed overnight and all said they had never experienced anything like it in the past and nor would they again because it would be their last visit.Obviously a case of low occupancy so lets change the description to attract more people        	                2	1	Thursday	booking	neutral

After booking via Bookings.com for a two night stay at the Turnberry Hotel and paying just shy of £700, I have been left with no choice but to name and shame owing to messages not being replied to and being ignored, I booked a Deluxe Room which was described as a 34Sq Meter Room, Bath and large Window, to be given a room that fell far short on every aspect of the description, the room was at best 14Sq Meters and also missing a bath, Bathroom was small and I could have touched the walls side to side which will tell you the size of the bathroom, the room was nothing as described complaint after complaint that is falling on deaf ears now with no reply to messages or emails has resulted in a wonderful review, Turnberry Hotel had a wedding on which Guests were allocate premium rooms for me to be paying a premium rate for something which was not delivered on. The hotel did offer a discount of a meal for one of the nights however this does not make up for paying a premium price for a room that wasn't as described.

After trying to use their site to book a hotel while stuck at LAX for a 15hr layover, I received a message on their payment screen saying that my payment didn’t go through. So thinking that it actually hadn’t, and being so damned exhausted after my rushed flight from Auckland, trying to get home to Canada to be with my family after my father’s sudden death - I stayed in the airport, waiting for my flight. It wasn’t until after we had landed in Canada that I saw in my email that the booking had in fact, processed. I called booking.com to explain the situation and after being fobbed off by their joke of a customer service line, I was told they still were going to shaft me for the $250 hotel cost, because I was a “no show”. Thankfully I was able to contact the hotel directly and was actually assisted with my situation. The Hyatt showed far more compassion and decency than this damned website, and next year, when I go back to Canada for my father’s memorial service I will be booking directly from the Hyatt website. DO NOT set yourself up for heartbreak and use booking.com. They are TERRIBLE!        	                2	1	Thursday	booking	negative

Had an utterly horrible experience in the hotel and had hoped booking.com could help us or at least put us in contact with the hostel but to be ignored after their initial response is exasperating.

The customer service are helpful with problems and do try to work things out but they have no idea what is going on at the time of check in because they have no control.

The Condo Company have refunded my cc, however with credit card transaction fees for different currencies I am now out of pocket by £68.06 for a booking I only had for two days! This is just on one booking and I am currently awaiting a refund from another 'FREE CANCELLATION' booking for May next year. Your advertisements for these properties should not read 'they MIGHT take a test, prepayment or an amount' it should read 'THEY WILL TAKE THE FULL AMOUNT ON RESERVATION'.        	                2	1	Wednesday	booking	positive
433	            Booking is a total scam!!! I've booked a guest house in Portugal. Arrived in the room had no windows and was extremely hot. No lift and no reception. Couldn't speak with anyone. So I've left and booked another place. I've obviously lost my money. OK. But the worst is really that this place was classified as 8.8/10 in booking! I've written a review with photos of the room. Booking has BLOCKED my review... Emailed them to know why was that blocked. They said I hadn't stayed at the property. W*F. That's exactly the point. I couldn't stay there so this is why I wanted to warn another users about this place!Summing up I will never use Booking again. Trip Advisor is much better and if I had checked it instead I wouldn't have booked this place as it's badly classified on trip advisor (where I could also publish my review).        	                4	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

In actual fact the property was 58 mins walk from the property, 8 miles from the airport and miles from any form of civilisation!  The property itself was behind burglar bars, filled with mosquitoes, had plumbing issues, only one air conditioner and insecure doors.  Totally ruined the family holiday we had been saving up for!        	                1	2	Tuesday	booking	negative

The property I booked was the suites at Beverley hills in Tenerife so I’d advise being very careful when you book through booking.com for this property        	                5	1	Tuesday	booking	neutral

444	            Just a terrible experience. If you are an entrepreneur involved in the short-term rental (holiday homes) I highly recommend that you do not use booking.com to run your business. They treat you like you are a hotel, their customers (guests) are outdated and expect to find a hotel not an actual holiday home, they are not respectful of your place, and worst of all it is not possible to give them reviews when they conclude their stay at your place. The impossibility for the host to leave a review to guests reflects on the way the guests ultimately tend to leave your apartments, TERRIBLE CONDITIONS. Another cons from booking.com is that no matter how much service charge you pay to them (15% - 20%) they will not protect you if something goes wrong, if you need to incur in extra cost for expenses related to damages caused by their guests, booking.com doesn't have an insurance to help you out. This means that although they make billions per year with your properties, they will not cover even one pound, THIS IS RIDICULOUS. Their customer service is just terrible. They tell you that they will call you back but 90% of the times they never call you back. Their mobile app is useless. Last but not least booking.com pays you one moth after the guests have checked-out of property. Sometimes they even end up paying a month and a week or two late (UNACCEPTABLE). They are not as good as they seem. Such a pity but goodbye booking.com. I hope the short term rental accommodation community leaves you straight away.        	                4	1	Monday	booking	negative
445	            A big bouquet of flowers to Booking for their prompt response and resolution of our problem. We were booked into an apartment in Seville in early September. Ten days before, and with our money paid non-refundably, we discovered that the apartment was given to someone else, and the owner had booked us in, without consulting us, to another of her apartments - further away, and significantly cheaper, though we had paid the higher price. Booking's email query system brought me no reply to two emails. However, when I rang the help centre, they had the email details in front of them and got into action at once. Fully on our side, a very speedy refund, and they even found us a replacement apartment!The lesson seems to be that it's easier to resolve problems in advance than when they blow up on the spot, when you are tired and stressed. Even so, we had great service from Olivia and Ellie on the help line.        	                1	5	Monday	booking	positive

I contacted Booking.com on their 7p a minute helpline and was put on hold twice whilst they tried to contact the premises. (£26 call charges were added to my bil) Myself and my wife were standing next to the manager whilst this was all going on and he didn’t receive a call. After 15 minutes I handed my phone to the manager only for the girl at Booking.com to refuse to talk to him as she had no way of verifying who he was.

450	            I've used them a few times and it's all been ok....until you need use their price promise guarantee. I'll try to keep my review short and to the point:1. I booked a hotel room for four nights. I then checked the price booking directly with the hotel (yes I know.....schoolboy error) and it was £48 cheaper,2. I immediately used Booking.com price promise link `Found it cheaper'. This is a fairly simple form which involves ticking a few boxes and attaching a link to prove your claim. The form would not submit (6 attempts) so I immediately sent a message via their 'contact us' link.3. It took two weeks to receive a reply despite sending two further messages.4. Their reply answered a totally unrelated question which was useless.5. Long story short; they continue to bombard you with unrelated answers to questions and eventually offer £20 as a good will gesture.6. I think we should all be made aware of one of the conditions of their 'price promise' conditions which is: (copied and pasted) 'The conditions of your reservation need to match the conditions of the other offer. In this case, your reservation doesn't allow a modification at this moment.'The conditions of booking were that no cancellation was allowed which is fairly straight forward so this answer, as usual was meaningless.To summarize: If you need to use the Booking.com price promise for a refund, forget it! The smart thing to do is check the hotel website before booking. I am now initiating a claim through the small claim courts which is fairly inconvenient, given the small amount but it's the principle.        	                12	1	Saturday	booking	positive

None of the staff were helpful. Even the email customer system was rubbish. I have basically been charged for one night's hotel booking, and the hotel had traced it as a 3 hour booking. We ended up not using it, and I'm still waiting for someone to attend to my query. In email, I've received a lot of rubbish replies but no real person has looked into the matter.

457	            Shambolic attempt at customer service. Having arrived at a hotel which didn’t match its offerings on the hotel booking, I complained both at the hotel (to no real avail) and to booking.com, hoping they would be able to oversee things. When we arrived at our hotel, an array of facilities were missing (too many to mention here), and the ‘garden view’ we were promised was a junk yard in the basement of the hotel - with cracked and smashed furniture everywhere. Truly horrific, particularly as I’d book this for my mother who is a garden enthusiast, and was planning to spend time in the garden offered. This was so dangerous I wouldn’t let either of us go outside in fear LDN injury. Despite the fact one assistant acknowledged my complaint to the hotel itself and attempted to address my points, I was later told I hadn’t complained and this meant booking.com could not assist me. I cannot understand how an overarching website does not support its customers, while they are so happy to accept bookings (and thus profit) in the first instance. I’ve used booking.com extensively in the past, both for personal and business use, and have never experienced a problem. It truly is a shame this (seemingly simple) issue cannot be resolved by the company and is being so firmly dismissed. Alternatives, such as Expedia, seem like a better option moving forward. I would like to book with a platform that I feel safe with and supported by.        	                1	1	Friday	booking	positive

465	            I would like to thank  Booking.com for wasting 10 weeks of my time and not actually helping me after being a regular customer since 2013.They say that they have contacted the hotel, the train company, the payment solution manager, but they seem to drop the ball constantly and go silent even on those correspondences.I used the QR code for a discount at a train station in Austria, and was charged by the train company and Booking.com. Now Booking.com expected me to show the email they sent me in Swedish to the Austrian train authority and say that I should decline to pay when asked for payment. As a consumer, it is none of my business as to how badly your partnerships with other companies are formed, but it is my business when you refuse to reply to emails and simply say 'non-refundable' every time you make an error.Also no inclination to take this on as customer feedback and improve services, no apology for wasting time and being ineffective and inefficient.        	                5	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

With no option  even the seat will not move or suitable for a family use, the car was dirty , inside and outside , full of trash under the seatand it was really a big mistake , the company refused to change or return the car even it was not even close to a V class. booking .com and rentalcars.com  refused to help or asset  with this cheating from the rental company this is was their answer:(( Dear Guest, We apologize for your bad experience with the Rental     Car. Unfortunately, we have no control of what the company you     rent it is giving you. What you should do is call the Rental     Company and leave a complaint so they can assist you and help you     with that.

474	"            Would leave 0 star if I could Booked a hotel through booking.com for the 5th of august right next to the eurotunnel so we could travel 200 miles there. Rest and then continue our journey to france. Had no problem.Done the same for the way home from France on the 10th of august so we could rest and then continue our 200 mile journey the next day. Bearing in mind I'm 5 months pregnant. My partner had already drove 3 hours and we had 2 children in the car. I clicked on the hotel for the postcode and it said ""cancelled by the hotel"" after the initial shock of having nowhere to stay for the night I called the hotel to find out what was happening. The owner of the hotel could not have been more sorry for us and continued to explain that booking.com had done it to them twice already that week and overbooked. She also stated that we were booked into a family room and they didn't own any family rooms within thier hotel.Booking.com had tried contacting us all week but due to being in disneyland and thier number not coming up as 'booking.com' we ignored the calls as not for one minute did we think it would be them.After checking emails from booking.com it was stated that they had found us another hotel within the area for an extra £39 and that the extra expense would be paid by the original hotel we were suppose to stay in. Before we could get that money back though we would have to upload receipts and wait up to a week.After a week in disneyland we had set aside enough money for the hotel on the way home, supper and food the next day before leaving so to pay and then wait a week for the money back was not possible unless I was to allow my partners children to go hungry for 24 hours.After explaining this to booking.com they kindly phoned around the area to see if we could pay the initial £75 fee and charge the extra £39 to them. They phoned me back to say that they had found somewhere and explained our situation to the hotel but failed to tell them that we were still able to pay for our food.If we had taken the hotel that the advisor had planned for us (We didn't) we would of felt like we were somehow ripping the hotel off as we weren't able to pay full price for the room but we could still afford food for the next 24 hours.In the end after hanging around outside the eurotunnel for 45 minutes my partner had had enough and proceeding to drive home instead of going to the hotel and having people feel sorry for us because we had 'no money'. We arrived home 7 hours later feeling very deflated which we didn't think we would after a lovely week in Disney.It's now 10 days since we arrived home and we haven't even received a response back from my partners feedback email let alone an apology.

475	"            We used bookings.com for our holiday in Croatia, and for the most part everything was fine. However we turned up at our Plitvice Lakes guesthouse and found we only had 3 rooms (2 triples and a double) instead of 4 (3 doubles and a triple), for 9 people. The guesthouse manager insisted that he had informed bookings.com that he only had 3 rooms available. We showed him the bookings.com confirmation with 4 rooms, and then called bookings.com in UK. ""Jason"" said he'd call back within 40 minutes, with alternative accommodation, but never did. Calling again was near impossible, as we kept being put on hold.As time was moving on, we asked the hotel manager if he'd provide a discount for 4 of us to share a room. He offered a Euros50 so we emailed bookings.com to say we may have a resolution, and could they call us back. No call.Then things turned ugly with the hotel manager when I explained that the 50 euros discount should be applied to the room prices he was offering, and not the original booking of 4 rooms. This meant our reduction was only 50 euros instead of 100 Euros. The manager told us to take the deal he offered or leave. We didnt have much option as bookings.com had not replied/called, and we had next to zero chance of finding another place nearby on our own in peak season. So in the end we reluctantly accepted that we'd stay in 3 rooms.Then followed a series of emails to bookings.com, with replies which were based on incorrect details provided by the manager to them (at one time saying that we had left and were not even staying at the place!).My group and I were very disappointed with our experience. Bookings.com could have been much more supportive, by making effort to keep in touch at a stressful time, and worked to resolve the situation.        "	                5	2	Monday	booking	negative

481	            I went on holiday this August with my partner and we stayed in a place called Ifigineia in Sami, Kefalonia which we booked through booking.com. The shower water in the accommodation was so hot that it scalded my hand giving me second degree burns to my right hand which has left me with restricted movement and potential scarring. We had to return to the hospital everyday for the dressings to be changed. This meant that we couldn’t do many of the things that we wanted to do whilst we were away.I have since looked at the reviews on booking.com and have seen a post from last year in which another person scalded their hand and yet nothing has been done to rectify this. We were given no warning about the temperature of the water nor was their a sign to inform us. We didn’t receive any support from booking.com and the hotel owner only gave us a slightly reduced rate. I want this post to show people that are thinking of booking through booking.com or even with hotel Ifigeneia that basic European safety regulations are not being met and both of these companies need to be held to account.

If anything goes wrong with the follow up payment, they send you an email giving you just 24 hours to notice the email, and then they cancel your booking. My problem was my credit card company replaced my credit card, which meant the one on file wasn't valid. Fair enough. But I don't look at my email every day - who does? However they gave me 24 hours to notice the email and change the information. The hotel itself got in touch with me because they didn't believe I could have cancelled. It took them ten minutes to reach me, but they used my phone, booking.com! and I was able to sort it out with the hotel direct. straight away.Really, after dealing with you for a few years, that just isn't on.        	                3	1	Saturday	booking	positive

One day before departing the US, booking.com sends me an email telling me that my CONFIRMED reservation can not be honored and they try to give me a BS story that the hotel realized they had an error in the system and they cannot honor my reservation. One month after my reservation was confirmed by booking.com and right before my trip they tell me that I can’t stay in the hotel I want and they try to sell me a different hotel. When I told them that I refuse their offer and want to stay in the hotel I selected, the agent starts giving me an attitude and treating me as I was being an idiot and why am I insisting on staying at the hotel I originally booked when there were many other options on their booking.com website to chose from. She had the audacity to try to make me feel guilty for their incompetence.NEVER AGAIN booking.com and I hope you go out of business because with such a business model you should not exist.        	                1	1	Friday	booking	negative

The place was filthy full with hairy dump with horrible smell of dump. and far far away from the beach. obviously we could not stay. the owner refused to give the money back and booking said that they will open a dispute and it will take at least 5 days. we left without a place to stay with 3 children and with a loss of our travel budget.        	                1	1	Friday	booking	negative

Would recommed to be as good as/ if not better than hotels.com/ Expedia etcAlso, from looking at the reviews I can’t help but think people get mixed up between a bad hotel and a bad hotel booking website- hardly booking.coms fault if you didn’t enjoy your stay!        	                5	4	Friday	booking	negative
490	            I booked a room at A Cape Cod Ocean Manor for July 22 through Booking.com. The room was completely filthy and absolutely stank. When I lay on the bed, I also began itching terribly.When I checked in earlier in the day, the key was tacked to the manager's office door. (This is also a violation of Massachusetts law which requires inns to verify the identity of their guests with ID). At the time, I rang the bell to the office door and no one answered. (I did check in before 5:00 p.m. and opened every window in the room, hoping the smell would improve while I went to dinner.)At 11:00 P.M., I decided I had to move to a hotel. I booked the Hyannis Harbor Hotel through Booking.com again and changed hotels. I then complained to Booking.com and asked for my money back for A Cape Cod Ocean Manor Inn. I have proof that I booked both hotels from them for the same day. I also have proof of when I checked into the Hyannis Harbor Hotel and when I checked out. Booking.com did not give me my money back for the first inn. I also believe that the inn's reviews have been manipulated. In my entire life, I have never had to move out of an inn or a hotel in the middle of the night.        	                1	1	Friday	booking	negative

We found out 1 week before our holiday that we have to give a 200 Euro deposit when we arrive, my girlfriend was on the call, she told the woman she was handing the call over to me ""Gabriella"" was the name of the operator, her surname was something like Marabrillas...she refused to speak to me so I got my girlfriend to tell her it was OK as you would with the bank, other companies or anyone else on the planet earth, and I came back on.She wouldnt let me get a word in saying she couldnt discuss it, its on my credit card! If they cant discuss it what why have they got my card details? I think its a big deposit in anybodys understanding, its a third of the cost of the accommodation on a 2 week holiday, and its not 200, its yet another 200, I just wanted to say ""its a third of the cost.. "" I wasnt trying to discuss anything, we ended up in a farce which was what she wanted, where I am saying things and my girlfriend is repeating them to her, her attitude was appalling in and of itself. As far as i am concerned if we missed that, its their fault for not making it clear enough, it absolutely is a big deposit no two ways, but the main thing was her not allowing me to speak, I am going to complain, I suspect she was just doing it to be difficult, everyone talks to you when the account holder says its OK, and again its on my card.In customer service sometimes people just want you to listen, I genuinely hope she gets sacked, its several hours later and Im furious.

497	"            I booked an apartment accommodation for my parents and myself at 120 New Place - Drummond Road for a night. I was asked to contact the property to collect the keys. So left a message to the property a couple of days before my arrival. There was no answer so tried calling but to no avail. Just a day before arrival, i receive a message from the property ""you are a couple?"". I was quite shocked and amused by this seemingly ridiculous question. However, knowing that booking.com does not deploy credibility checks before allowing people to list their properties, i answered the question saying - no, we are family planning a day trip to London. A couple of hours later, they reply saying there is a problem with the bathroom and it wont be sorted before your accommodation date. It was absolutely shocking and unbelievable that such people exist who give lame excuses to cheat customers. How come they listed the property without even checking if it’s suitable to accomodate people. I narrated the entire story to booking.com in a couple of messages. Not getting a reply for a day, i was forced to call. After hearing me out, they said they need to contact the property before they could process a refund. No prizes for guessing, the property did not answer even their call. So, i was told to wait till the day of accommodation. If the property didn't reply by then, i would be offered choices for alternate accommodation. Ultimately, i was made to wait till the last minute. What is the purpose of listing properties with best price guarantees when there is no guarantee about your stay.

After contacting Booking.com and waiting to hear back a cleaning woman was sent to wash the dishes. She said that the owner knew about the pipe already. Daily we became aware of more problems, fridge not cooling properly, no TV remote, unusable washer and dryer and reported them through Booking.com.  None were resolved. After going to a laundromat for over 2 hours and all the unresolved complaints, I asked for partial reimbursement. Emailed twice through Booking.com and was told ""owner said no"". Sent a dispute with photos, and copies of emails asking for 1/2 day rental and the cost of laundry to be reimbursed. The Booking.com rep said ""...no compensation can be provided in this case."" And then ""Approaching property staff during your stay to address this issue was the right step. In the future, if you're unable to resolve a situation with a property, call our customer service. Our staff, who know the language and culture of the property, can help make communication easier.""  Really?! So I did everything I was suppose to do, creating stress, eating up time, spending additional money... but nothing was fixed and I still can't get even 1/10 of the total rental cost reimbursed? This is crazy. There isn't any recourse for misrepresentations? I'm relatively sure that people renting a ""home"" listing a TV, fridge, washer/dryer, and sink expect to have them working and usable during the stay. If not, how can you list them as amenities?I won't be using Booking.com again.

Hence, your credit card company cannot intervene to apply a refund to your card.

510	            1 star rating: misleading payment process, missing refund! lack of response to my complain email.sequence of events:- found a japan hotel with free cancellation for 2019 stay- was stated payment of X amount in yen will be taken and gave the impression this will be taken at the hotel rather than straight away.- In fact, on payment page it has an option that one could tick to opt to pay the hotel now!!! which of course i did not choose. Again it gave the impression that payment won't be required right away.- Cancelled it on the same day and received email confirming no charge as I cancelled in line with the free cancellation policy.- still waiting refund for more than 3 weeks. not happy...- sent in complain email 4 days ago, which was forwarded again to their customer service team, still waiting for a response.I do not like the way they do not make it clear whether payment will be taken right away or at some point in the future between the date of booking and date of arrival.  If I have to pay now they should have said complete payment at point of booking when showing the hotels on the list, not on the last page of booking, that is, if it doesn't first try to trick you in thinking immediate payment not required by giving you an option to pay the hotel now...No refund for more than 3 weeks, now have to chase and complain as I'm being hit by fx fee and charges as well.        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	negative
511	            Booking.com or the hotel estapona spa will not respond to any emails, we were due to travel to Malaga and stay at the hotel however due to circumstances outside our control we had no alternative other than to contact the hotel and inform them that we wouldn’t be able to go, the reservation desk thanked us in advance and said that we would be refunded  and as it was high season would be able to let the rooms out and that the hotel was completely booked for the next 8 weeks so they couldn’t offer any alternative dates etc . After discussing Options we said the refund would be the only solution, they suggested that we contact booking.com to arrange the refund.To date we’ve emailed booking.com customer services and also the hotel but both parties have failed to respond hoping that we give up! The amount paid was £1500 approx and although I booked through booking.com it transpires after discussing it with the credit card company and MasterCard that the payment was taken by the hotel it’s self and not booking.com, which means firstly that any t&amp;c’s relative to booking.com do not apply nor is it the responsibility of booking.com to refund as they’ve not been paid......so your contract is directly with the hotel in question! We have now got MasterCard and the hotels merchant bank investigating this complaint under the “ section 75 credit card act” for misrepresentation and they have raised a case, I’ve also got the Spanish equivalent of trading standards investigating the hotel practises too. So buyers beware booking.com are merely misleading customers and not even receiving your payment so effectively they cannot refund you!!! So you may wish to think twice when booking and paying in full as they will leave you to battle it out with hotels abroad acting under different laws....fortunately we had paid with a credit card and not debit...!!!        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	positive
512	"            I think Booking.com deserves the Nobel prize for the worst customer service ever. After being told by one of the properties on their platform, upon check-in, that the room we booked through bokig.com was not available, after having spent over 1h on the phone with booking.com, after having waited for a call back that never came, they suggested to book a place 90 mins drive away from where we were, and in another country!! 🤣🤣Ah, and they offered as a compensation (actually, ""a show of good customer service"" as they called it, can you believe it?? 🤣🤣) €25. I strongly suggest that whenever possible you book your hotels directly with the property, skipping these inefficient, customer non-oriented and heartless agents.

513	            After my recent experience with booking.com, I would not advise anybody to use this service. I have received appalling customer service from them after chasing a case for a refund for the past two months. I was unfortunately forced to cancel a trip due to a family member's critical illness and booking.com's hotel provider agreed to issue a refund. After numerous attempts at chasing the refund, advisers failed to call me back on more than 10 occasions. to add to this, I was told different information by every person I spoke to. I then escalated my claim to the senior managers, who were nothing but rude and unhelpful and refused to admit that they had ever agreed to a refund, despite the fact that I had it in writing and presented it to them. I am in disbelief that a company so well known would treat a customer so poorly. Unfortunately they closed my case and I was not able to claim back my £650.

514	            You can't trust this website. Disgusted with this company for the 2nd time they have ripped me off. I booked a hotel, and then when I went back to cancel it it was not on my bookings list, after searching 3 times it was still not there. Naturally I assumed it was not booked and therefore I didn't need to cancel it. Funnily enough the money still comes out of my account. So I called to explain that it was their websites error. I still have to pay because as a customer I can't trust what is on my bookings list. I use this website as a convenient and quick way to book therefore why should I have to contact other parties due to your fault. I cannot afford to pay for a hotel I didn't use because your website is useless. They then went on to say that it was my fault as I hadn't checked with them or called the hotel. Funnily enough I assumed that as a booking platform I could trust the website and that the whole point of using them was for ease and speedy bookings. They are now ignoring my messages.        	                1	1	Monday	booking	negative
515	            Hired a car through booking.com and paid upfront for a mid sized vehicle such a seat leon or Golf. Upon arrival was informed the vehicle i paid for is not available and they offered me a mini vehicle for the same price. I was in no mood for a long discussion and argument after a long trip and had to end up paying more to upgrade. Its shameful and dishonest business practice and I would never use these people again.        	                8	1	Monday	booking	negative

I phone dthe hotel - they wouldn't refund. I phoned booking.com - they said they can't refund if the hotel won't. I said why would I willlingly book a hotel 300 miles away that I couldn't even get to in time! So the Booking.com APP can book hotels and authorise payment that easily without me personally pressing any buttons. I have deleted the APP and won't be using booking.com again.        	                2	1	Monday	booking	positive
517	            WORST EXPERIENCE EVER ! I would like to express my dissatisfaction with Booking.com, as a loyal customer I expected more, and a high level of standard and regard towards your customers. I have always used booking.com for all of my holidays however I am now completely disgusted with the way I have been treated and will no longer be using your services or recommending it henceforth.  On the 3rd of June 2018, we had a 6 am flight arriving in Marbella Spain to celebrate my 25th birthday. The night before, I awaited details from booking.com in regards to checking in. Nothing was sent so I took it upon myself to chase it up around 3:15 pm the day before we traveled. I called booking.com to ask what was going on. The member of staff I spoke to couldn’t even care less about my situation and neither did she sound sympathetic or even apologetic about the current situation at hand. I was told my booking had been canceled and that booking.com had no contact with the apartment anymore. I asked why I wasn’t informed about this and there was no explanation given. I then asked what the solution was as I had less than 9 hours before arriving in Spain. She told me she will try and find another apartment similar to what we had previously booked. We had previously booked a two bedroom apartment, and an outdoor private pool and jacuzzi and bbq grill facilities. I received 2 options within 2-3 hours which were completely different to what we originally booked. The first option was 1hour 45 minutes away from our existing booking and in the middle of nowhere with no tourist attractions, restaurants or grocery stores in site, no outdoor pool or anything to entertain ourselves. The second option was a hotel with twin beds meaning I and my fiance would have to share a twin bed on my birthday! And we would also be in a separate space to my sister and best friend. I had already ordered for catering to the apartment which would now have to be canceled. A cake  Bbq food  Drinks  Ballons  Decoration  All of this had to be canceled as booking.com had failed to find me an alternative solution in the same location, and some of the companies would not deliver to me on the other side of town. I had lost out on all of the things I had paid for and planned for my birthday and was left with nowhere to go to when I arrived at the airport.  At 6:45 am on the 3rd of June. We all sat at the arrivals with no reservation or hotel to check into. We quickly went online to try and find a new apartment asap. Luckily we found one 1 hour 40 minutes drive from the airport. We called booking.com to ask if they could transfer the existing amount of 800.00 EUROS to this new booking as we intended to book it. At that point in time, it was the only apartment available for 4 adults that were within a reasonable price range. To our disbelief, booking.com refused to help us with transferring the funds to the new booking! We were told we would have to cuff out another 1200 EUROS to pay for our new booking. We wouldn’t believe that booking.com put us In such a terrible situation and now we were having too use the money we intended on spending celebrating my birthday to pay for a new apartment.  We were at the airport now for 2 hours 45 minutes tired, exhausted, and angry Booking.com still didn’t show any empathy towards us and just told us they would issue a refund within 3-4 working days and that was it!  We then tried to organize an airport pick up but we were told they did not provide that service at the new apartment. SA Nau adults only. With 4 adults and 4 large bags, a taxi would cost us almost 100.00 euros one way! And as we were now in a completely different location we would also be spending more money trying to get around town. We decided the smartest thing to do was rent out a car which cost us almost 600.00 Euros but worked out cheaper than ordering taxis, this was an expense we hadn't originally budgeted for as we had already sorted out airport pick up previously with the apartment.   At this point, I tried to enjoy what I could of my birthday even though everything was ruined and disorganized. I had no cake no balloons, no catering and I was just so stressed out on my birthday. To then see that booking.com had refunded us less than we originally paid! This made me absolutely fuming and even more angry and irritated. Not only had you guys ruined my birthday! Now you want to cheat me out on my own money. I sent so many emails and screenshots of payment demanding an explanation. And for two weeks booking.com claimed to not receive any of my emails, or be able to see my attached evidence.   I had the worst birthday ever. I spent way more than anticipated. I cried on my birthday as everything I had planned was ruined. I received no formal apology from booking.com and was now in a battle to get my own money back.   It is now 10 weeks since my birthday and I still have not received an apology or compensation from booking.com. I am still waiting for my refund and I am still being passed around departments explaining my situation. I have never been treated so bad by any company. I have cried over this situation, I cried on my birthday as all my plans were ruined and I had no cake! I have screamed and shouted on the phone as no one seems to understand the urgency of my matter in booking.com. It is shameful to think such a big company can make such a devastating mistake. Although there is no compensation that will bring back my birthday, I would still like this matter to be handled professionally, I would appreciate if I could be refunded urgently and compensated for this horrible experience I am going to have to remember for the rest of my life.        	                1	1	Monday	booking	negative
518	            Would not use again. I booked a room in Exeter way back in January for daughters graduation in July. When I turned up last month the hotel were not expecting me and therefore had no room for me.They said I was the 3rd person to turn up that week from Booking.Com with no booking confirmed with hotel. After 4 hours travelling I literally had nowhere to go. Eventually got through to Booking.com who found me a dingy room a cab right away that I had to pay for. No television or room service. To make matters worse they made me pay again as they said it would take 12 days to refund my original booking . The most appalling service I’ve ever experienced. They eventually refunded me my original costs plus the extra costs I subsequently incurred but they now won’t respond to my emails or phone calls regarding compensation. AVOID at all costs as apparently the hotel I originally booked said Booking.com had sent numerous people to them and taken their money beforehand , even confirming the room a week before as they did with me.  The hotel had ceased business with Booking.com months ago and said they should not have been selling rooms. Ruined my daughters graduation :( I will in future go back to using the other hotel websites.        	                6	1	Sunday	booking	negative

I felt cheated. Check direct with the hotel first would be my advice.        	                5	3	Sunday	booking	neutral

I completed the calendar to reflect availability etc.  Got two reservations almost immediately but also got an email from booking.com saying they could no longer advertise the property due to lack of availability.  I responded I have no idea what that meant as I can only show the availability I have.  Not my fault I am popular with repeat guests, plus I am listed on other sites.  It has been four weeks now and no response from them as to how we can sort this out.  Nor do I know if the bookings already made will be honored by them.  I would like to release the dates so that my other booking partners who I have worked with successfully for years can sell those nights, but am afraid that the booking.com guests will turn up and I find myself in an embarrassing situation.  Would love to hear from other property owners about their experiences.        	                1	2	Sunday	booking	positive

There has been the odd minor delay and room's being overbooked but then I have always got an upgrade in that scenario so can only praise the company and say do not be put off by the bad reviews.Also, booking.com do not take money from your card in cases of ""free cancellations,"" sometimes the hotels do but then you always get refunded should you decide to cancel. Furthermore, the people moaning about not being refunded probably didn't go for a non-refundable option (which is normally the more expensive option) and then whinge at their own mistakes.

526	            I wish I could give 0 stars. The problem I have been having with Booking has really wasted a great deal of my time and has caused a great deal of embarrassment with the people coming to stay at my house.The first problem is that the automatic description said that I let people use my kitchen. I put very clearly that people can use my kitchen if they rent the whole house but NOT the rooms. So there was obviously a glitch in the automatic system.This caused me a problem since the people coming over thought they could use the kitchen (and rightfully so). I called to complain about this, and the person first person on booking (whom I gave a decent review because I believed her) told me that the clients were mistaken because it said clearly that this was limited to the house. I looked on the French version (which is the one I use) and saw this corroborated what the person told me.I therefore told the guests that they were mistaken. I learned later that that person lied to me and that it clearly stated in the description in ALL THE OTHER LANGUAGES EXCEPT FRENCH that I would let people use the kitchen.When I called to complain various times the employees tried to say that the description wasn't misleading (on the grounds that I had put that they couldn't use the kitchen in the rooms) or put the fault on me because I put a photo of the kitchen. I never had any of this problem with Airbnb (with whom I've been for 3 years) or homeaway.comAnd the fact I had to call back 5 times for something which shouldn't have been there is inexcusable.What's even worse is that it takes around a week to change the language!Before giving a bad review of Booking I wanted to give them the chance to redeem the situation. Indeed, I know people do make mistakes, but the responsible and honorable companies are the ones who recognize these mistakes and make up for them. Irresponsible and dishonorable companies don't. We now see which category Booking falls into.        	                1	1	Friday	booking	negative

They were fully booked and they didn’t try to help us. I had to call booking several times to sort this out. Of course, they couldn’t find an alternative hotel in their system and didn’t try to properly help us. The best they did was to tell if you manage to find an alternative hotel, we will compensate you. Well, we didn’t and had to drive 3,5 hours back! How can you compensate us for that?The alternative option they offered was an hour drive away in an area which I specifically told them that I was willing to stay. I explained to the agent that we needed secure parking and that I wasn’t willing to drive an hour plus away in a not very nice area. What alternative option the agent sent to us was a hotel of a very poor quality (just to match the price) with no secure parking and in area that I told him that we didn’t want to stay.        	                1	1	Friday	booking	positive

530	            Booking.com Booking.NO…………………..Since June 2018, I have tried to contact them tried numerous time via e-mail and telephone re a potentially dangerous property that they are publicising on their website, Lux Apartments in Huddersfield. Not only do the reviews state that the smoke dectors are covered, which in itself is illegal, the information given on the page regarding parking and their being a concierge for the property is completely untrue. All this plus the condition of the apartments is reviewed as disgusting amongst other descriptions. Most of the reviews are one star with a couple being five stars. However, when you read the five star reviews they are clearly cut, pasted and edited from another site. No property goes from one star to five stars with nothing in between.I have called customer services numerous times and despite them stating that the issue will be escalated, each time I call back I am told the previous calls have not even been logged in their system, They even rub salt in the wound by sending two customer service reviews following these calls!!!! I have taken to social media to highlight Booking.com’s  complete disregard for their customers and to make potential customers aware of the pathetic level of customers service they may receive from them. I am also going to contact the press with this issue. As my main concern is the safety within the property and given the fact that families could be potentially living in this accommodation, Booking.com is clearly disregarding the safety of potential customers by endorsing this property. Should you assume there other properties that they are endorsing that are potentially dangerous?        	                2	1	Thursday	booking	negative

However it is a faceless organisation, unable or unwilling to speak to customers or to resolve their problems.I had a very awkward conversation with the manager of a hotel in Ghana who attempted to charge what I regarded as unacceptable extras.  However, when I found the information sent by booking.com, I realised that the hotel has been sent (by booking.com) something quite different from what I had booked.More recently, a booking was cancelled owing to a credit card query.  Rather than check the card when the booking was made, this was done a week in advance of the stay and we were only informed two days in advance.  So there we were, with three young kids, in a foreign country with no hotel and limited opportunity to rebook.Booking.com - I would appreciate a reply and advice on how clients should resolve such situations.        	                14	1	Wednesday	booking	positive

Customer services were incredibly rude and simply stated that it wasn't their problem and as per their T&amp;Cs, it was wholly up to us to sort out. This resulted in myself, my wife, my 60 year old father in-law and our 2 children (aged 9 and 11 months old) having to sleep rough on the streets of Spain, until 9am the following morning, when we were able to seek out alternative arrangements.To say their customer service is an absolute disgrace is an understatement!!!        	                5	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

Booking.com DO NOT act on behalf of the customer only the hotel/accommodation. I will now always book directly through the accommodation or other companies such as agoda or trivago. Whether the hotel agrees or disagrees with my complaint, given the evidence I’ve supplied in relation to it (which very clearly does not match the hotel or booking.com description) booking.com do not feel they have any responsibility to act on behalf of the customer and support them. I have held off leaving this review to allow booking.com to rectify the situation. This has not happened.        	                2	1	Wednesday	booking	positive
541	            I booked a room this summer with booking.com and when I first booked the room the money for the room was taken right off my debit card account. A day or two later the money was put back on my card and I received several text messages stating my card was invalid and to update my card info within 24 hours or I would lose my room. I did that probably 5 times..  Before our trip I noticed that my debit card had an over draft on it for $1200. I realize the booking company charged me for two rooms. I only booked ONE room..It states that to cancel a room it will charge you $900. So I think I’m doing the right thing by calling the company to try to get everything straightened out, also I didn’t want to be charged again for trying to cancel a room that I never booked in the first place. Booking.com tells me that to get a refund that they will have to get an aprroval from the third party, so I send them all the info they ask for and I stayed in touch with booking.com multiple times before and after our trip to fix this problem. Even talked to the people at the resort, which they told me that since I booked the room through booking.com that they have nothing to do with it. The woman that works for the resort also told me to never use booking.com again because they see this problem MANY times when people book their rooms with this company. After our trip I decide to go to my bank and file a dispute. Long story short booking.com is still claiming that I booked two rooms and is wanting me to pay for their mistake since no one stayed in the second room that I supposedly booked. Although, how was I suppose to cancel a room without being charged $900, I did the right thing by staying in touch with the company trying to get a handle on things. They knew before the weekend of our trip that I did not book two rooms, they had plenty of time to get things situated so that someone else could’ve booked the second room that I never wanted. I have sent screenshots of messages where they were telling me my card was invalid multiple times and also copies of my bank statements. I believe this was a glitch on booking company’s website and they’re trying to make me pay for it. I’m still dealing with this crisis, and will be taking this company to court. I don’t have an extra thousand laying around to pay for their mess. Do not book with this company!! I would give them negative stars if I could.        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	negative
542	            Waited on hold twice for 15 minutes, then talked to the representative about several questions i had. When he couldn't answer them he hung up on me. I had to wait on hold again, and AGAIN they hung up on me when I was asking questions about how to check my property id using my phone. Then I had to tell them i had a pipe burst so i couldn't accomodate the guest, and they said that I'm responsible for paying the difference to relocate them! unbelievable. Do not use booking.com, stick to airbnb and vrbo.        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	positive

544	            I booked a family room for 4 in Dover before our ferry to Calais. I received an E-mail 6 days before telling me that hotel had been overbooked and sent me a link to another hotel with a family room. Bearing in mind this was £20 more, we got there and found it had 3 beds. We were not happy to spend £90 on this as we wrre a 4. I have sent numerous e mails and not really got anywhere. Phoned this morning and spoke to someone in Thailand who I couldn't understand as there was no reception. I am still awaiting a reply.        	                1	2	Tuesday	booking	negative
545	            Have well and truly  been stitched up. I applied the filter to show hotels with breakfast included in price. I subsequently booked, WRONGLY assuming that the price included breakfast, as per my filter. This was not the case, and it only came to light, after I started to receive emails from booking.com, asking if I would like to add. Breakfast to my stay. I subsequently emailed, them, and received no reposnse. So today I telephoned. Received the usual platitudes about how sorry she was, and that the booking was not refundable, etc etc etc. Just the usual customer service spiel that you get. Not a genuine response at all.she did however agree the breakfast at this establishment was rather high. But it was beyond her control, and my only option is to pay for breakfast. I definitely will not be paying £10 ahead for breakfast, which equates to an extra £40,  when Mcdonalds is 25 yards away. I could have got a much better hotel, with spa facilities and breakfast included for an extra £20. I,ve beeen stung and taught a lesson. Booking.com, are obviously so large that they can afford to loose the odd customer. The only way, I feel I can justify being conned, is to voice my opinion on Booking.com. At every given opportunity.        	                3	1	Tuesday	booking	positive
546	            Me and my family booked a place to stay in London recommended by booking.com and guess what, it was absolutely decimated.Everything in this “spectacular penthouse” they recommended was absolutely destroyed.There were 8 of us, there was only enough room for 6 of us.We complained to booking.com and the trash penthouse later and they were all legitamate Aholes.They didn’t give a crap that we were suffering in this trash boat of a penthouse, which was more of an office space than an apartment or penthouse for that matter.The service from booking.com was terrifyingly horrible.They wouldn’t help us at all,I don’t know if it was because the majority of us were Chinese and it was an act of racism.However, I don’t believe that anybody should be treated like prisoners on their holiday.To anybody planning to use booking.com in the future, don’t unless ur dumb as FTo booking.com,F You and your terrible service,company and supporters.        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	negative
547	            My experience was overall horrible - I had to cancel my reservation and received the email that it is free of charge. It also said that if I have been charged, I should call the facility at the provided number. Given that I ended up being charged, I called Novotel who told me (quite logically) that I booked through an agent (booking.com) and should not expect them to reimburse me. I called back Booking and talked to an agent who told me that she will contact the hotel and if they still refuse she will then activate booking warranty and i will still get reimbursed. Nothing was happening for few days so i called again and stumbled upon an agent that is a disgrace! She was patronising, cinical, arrogant and treated me as an idiot - she kept on saying that the proof of charge was not provided (which it was and i received an email confirmation of the reception from it!), then she was claiming that they actually said that it was not adequate and failed to deliver where did they say that (as they didn't!) and then she kept on saying that the proof of charge is not valid without wanting to say whats not valid. She was absolutely horrible and arrogant and the connection broke so i had to call again and Mauro solved my problem within minutes. However, overall - booking tricked me and kept my money for over a week, then insulted me and treated in a very humiliating way so no - I will never recommend booking to anyone.        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

549	            I have used booking.com for a few years. Recently I have noticed they don't fine print the accommodation. We booked a room on the lido Venice. The hotel was very nice no problem.  But booking with booking.com we were not aware that we were booking a economy room this being that you were not actually in the hotel but a building away from the hotel.  If I was made aware of this on booking I would of asked for a upgraded room and happily paid the extra. As like I said the hotel was lovely.  I have no problem with economy rooms but if I see pictures of a hotel I assume I will be in the hotel.Little worried about booking with them again        	                1	3	Monday	booking	positive

I keep saying the kids could stay in the same bed with me, but hotel refused.  Hotel confirmed won't charge me but BOOKING.COM itself charged me.I sent the conversation to the booking.com but they said they won't accept this evidence!   So end up booking.com charged me? I don't wanted to cancel my booking i was told to do it.  This is not some mistake I made, so I feel very angry and not fair.Their customers services keep giving me different answer every time and end up they just said i need to contact the hotel myself.So why I need to book via the booking.com?  I could just book via hotel directly.  End up booking.com said that they won't do anything. This company is dishonest and they keep have a lot of adv. on the TV.I hope I could go on the news and tell everyone. and I am planning to to go the small claim court.        	                2	1	Monday	booking	negative

It was charged $16USD per night for adding an adult but it did not mention any of such cost when I called booking.com. It was completely not happy.

557	"            I am writing in regards to my recent experience with Booking.com. I have not previously used this service until now and will not recommend them to anyone. My experience was not positive due to what was, in my opinion, deliberate misinformation regarding the booking and cancellation policies.I entered my information in order to Reserve a room, not to pay. I read the notice stating "" you pay nothing now, pay when you check in"". Therefore, I believed i had reserved a room for tonight. However, I awoke today, on my anniversary, very sick with back and shoulder pain for which I am under Drs care, and attempted to reschedule. I was not able to. I attempted to cancel and was charged the price of the room. I will not use Booking.com in the future and will alert everyone I know about this unfortunate experience. My husband and I both attempted to contact the hotel business directly, but that individual did not speak English. We attempted to contact Booking.com without success.

558	            Made a booking through booking.com on 18th July for a one night stay on 26th/27th July near Alicante airport. Payment was made by credit card.On 25th July the hotel emailed me through booking.com to say that their lift was out of action and my room was on the 14th floor. The options offered were to continue with the booking and use the stairs &amp; receive a 10e refund, or cancel for a full refund.As I have heart failure, the stairs were not an option so I emailed straight away asking them to cancel the booking and process a full refund.I contacted booking.com but they just pointed me towards the hotel. I could not cancel via their website as the booking I had made was non refundable. There is no option to cancel a booking when the hotel has messed up and get a refund. Ten days later and I'm still waiting for my refund, and neither the hotel nor booking.com are communicating with me.I have now put my credit card company on the case to get my refund.Moral of the story? When things go wrong, don't expect any help from booking.com! They used to be ok, but then I never had this situation before. I will certainly try and deal with hotels directly in future.

When we got there we had to walk for miles - uphill - on one of the hottest days of the  year.    We couldn’t check in as we were early Altho there was no other reason why.  We just made the only cafe anywhere to be seen and got a coffee while we waited to check in.   There’s was no hotel. We were on a very deserted uni campus.  There was no one person to be seen.   I had no idea there was a hotel in the middle od the grounds.  Oh wait.  There’s wasnt.  What was sold to me as a hotel room was a university dorm room.  No tv. No drinks making facilities    No iron as promised. Nothing    It was a dorm room    I was so disgusted we checked back outback and decided to go home that night instead of the next day.    There’s were no shops. No amenities.  No eateries.  Nothing for miles. Which was the opposite of what I was told.  For £75 I expected to at least had a tv or a proper bed not a bunk    It was an absolute nightmare.    We didn’t stay.

The booking was 9 months away! You could cancel 3 hours ‘for free’ before booking but I’m still trying to get money back over £2000. Credit card company fraud department said it’s common and had thier customer service number ready for me. Read the fine print of all booking.com reservations. Avoid at all costs. Never use your debit card to book either as they would have that money out of your current account! It’s a total con. Free cancellation should mean free cancellation not hours and hours of stress and worry trying to get money back. Very disappointed in the rudenesss if staff, slow response and they never once called me back. Spent tons of money on hold trying to speak to different person every time going through the whole story.

I had to find a new hotel room at 1 in the morning. Booking.com did nothing except losing my time and money on the phone. No refund no excuses, just listening and giving you the same customer relation management pre-text. - 2nd : just booked an apartment in Riga, i had to change credit card details as i received a new card. I did it on booking.com but it seems they didnt communicate it to the hotel which tried to charge the card unsuccessfully. Ending up having my hotel cancelled today. I called booking.com this morning since i was supposed to check in at 1200 today, and they were not able to simply use my card or use another one and keep my booking. As a result they offer me to book another apartment with lower standards but more expensive, without compensation or taking it on them.

Mysterious ""virtual credit card"" only allows payment after guest has arrived. Card details are hidden.) Supposed to collect customer address but postcode often missing (and cannot then charge card). Doesn't have option for guest to tell owner they are bringing a dog (leading to issues with payments and house rules). Approval process tedious (and unnecessary as I already had 3 listed properties). Setup process seems to be repetitive (facilities tickboxes need ticking and then re-ticking). Policies setup obtuse (option to deviate from template is hidden). Entirely focused on hotels... my customers are booking a whole house but they insist on calling it a room. The property description (which the owner has no control over) is appalling ""xxx Cottage benefits from a summerhouse and a microwave"". I could go on and on...

574	            Absolutely disgusting company. A total disgrace. Stick with Expedia and save yourself the mental torture of dealing with these people. My hotel rooms were not suitable, AC was not working in either of the 2 rooms I booked, shower would not turn off and was running all night. While I accept this is not booking.coms fault the Hotel agreed they would let us check out after 1 night without charge but I would need to contact booking.com for a refund as they hold funds from the hotel for 30 days. Hotel gave me a letter to say and prove they are happy for me to be refunded. Contacted booking.com while I was still on holiday. They didnt respond so had to call when I was back. I was asked to send them a copy of my bank statement so they could verify they had charged me (seriously?) I asked the lady I spoke to on the phone I would send the statements and a letter from the hotel to prove they are happy for me to be refunded but in the interim please contact the hotel and speak to the reservations lady as she gave me her name and assured me they would approve the refund.As booking.com did not look into my case properly within 30 days they released funds to the hotel even though I raised a dispute. Then they kept fobbing me off with telling me they are trying to contact the hotel and have to wait for them to return the funds. My point was the funds should never have been sent to the hotel in the first place and that they had 30 days in which to investigate my claim. Their response was it took long because they are extremely busy. I initially contacted booking.com the day I left the hotel which is the 15th June and today the 1st of August I am still waiting for my money back. I was told near a week ago someone will contact you tomorrow to raise the refund and yet again no response. Try calling them you are left waiting for 20-30mins.

When we got to our hotel we was not on there list. On checking we found was the same hotel name but in Scotland f---ed off was an understatement  so had to travel to Scarborough to get an hotel as everywhere was booked. On contacting f---ing.com via email my return message was thank you for your email please be aware we don't respond to all of them and they where true to there word never got a reply. Also this happened to a German guy booked same hotel only to find was the one in Scotland and because they don't care. Nothing will change.

576	"            DO NOT USE Booking.com.  They did not confirm our booking with the hotel which was eventually sorted by the hotel, they had to move other guests to accommodate us. It was extremely embarrassing and we were late for a family dinner.  When I rang Booking.com to inform them of what had happened, I expected them to be apologetic but the ""customer service"" assistant was extremely rude saying that their system could not have failed.  I then wrote a complaint about the manner in which I was spoken to.  They called me at 8.45pm which I missed, a garbled message was left which sounded like an apology.  This morning I wasted another 15 minutes of my life which I won't get back, on a phone call with another quite rude member of staff who said they had sent me an email with an apology.  I have not received an email.  She again was adamant that their email system could not have failed!  Booking.com should think about upgrading their IT systems and their customer service staff.  I will never use this awful company again.        "	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	negative
577	            Awful experience through booking.com. I booked into the Platt Hall in Hendon, and where do I start- everything went wrong. Firstly, the postcode was wrong. At the site, I was hastily shown around the room, meaning I did not understand well how the key worked and had to call the reception (at that time, their phones still worked). 20 mins later, I was leaving when I got stuck in the flat- key did not work. Calling the office, the phones were shut off! I called for help out of kitchen window for 20 mins before some student fetched someone from reception. After saying 'it never happened before', I was freed, but in tears. I told them to fix their phones as I was going to call 999- he said they would, but of course didn't!! This morning I woke to find the main light wasn't working- back to the reception at 7 am as phones weren't working- I called the office line in front of the guy and he gave me a mobile number!! Again the line, 'it never happened before'. He also gave me a horrid industrial light until 'electrician comes' to change the bulb, and why don't i use the small lamp?? Because you didn't put the bulb in! This made him laugh. So all in all, you may save a few pounds using booking.com but you will give yourself a big headache. I'm never booking through booking.com and I'm definitely raising a dispute once I'm out of this dump.        	                3	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

579	            I booked accommodation via booking.com and read all the information about it on the booking.com website which omitted vital information about the pool which was the sole reason to book and use the site as I required a pool. The pool wasn’t available for long periods of the day which inconvenienced my family and lost us 24 hours of pool access. When I complained upon arrival I received generic email responses from booking.com and no resolution to the issue I raised. The accommodation was of a poor quality despite being more expensive than others locally. I was Mis-sold this accommodation and effectively had my holiday ruined by booking via booking.com with the information they provided. Do not use booking.com, they will not help or rectify their mistakes and there is no support or way to complain about what you have paid for!

Then walked around and found out there was a massvie construction site around my unit. In the booking. It said my unite was facing the pool. There was no pool. The unit waa suuround the contruction. The problem was the people started to work very early in the morning in Vietnam ( 7 Am). Anyway, i said to myself. Well i won't be inside during the day anyway. And it is noisy everywhere in Vietnam. But at 1 Am the workers still went on. We couldn't sleep. The bathroom was flooded after 2minutes shower. We had to run out quickly without having a proper shower. Then i found bugs in the room. The light buld in the bathroom didn't work when we checked in. But they changed for me right away. I contacted Booking.com to help because i moved out. I could not stay there after the 1 first night. They asked me to send them proof pictures. Today i got their email said they couldn't help me to get my refund because i booked a non refundable.        	                1	1	Thursday	booking	neutral

600	"            Until recently I had great experiences with Bookings. However Bookings recently invited me to refer friends for them and myself to receive $20 off. We were going on a family vacation so I referred both my brother and sister. Bookings sent us confirmation emails. However the hotel had no record of our reservation. Luckily the hotel had available rooms. The manager of the hotel said that if they hadn't had rooms there would be nothing they could do for us even with the booking confirmation. The manager reported that they also send a confirmation email once they receive notice from bookings. We called Bookings and they basically said ""oops our fault. But there is nothing we can do to fix it."" No kindness. And none of us received the $20 discount for a referral.  I believe the ""refer a friend"" is a complete scam.

We cannot even review the place to warn others against this scam, as apparently the review must be done during the stay.        	                4	1	Sunday	booking	negative

Even the final charge screen showed  £910 before I press the button to confirm. A few days later I noticed that my.card had been charged £936.40. Upon speaking to bank they had charged €1027 And in doing so my bank charged a transaction fee. Booking.com did not want to know and blamed the hotel which I had booked for the error and washed there hands if it.

The actual payment (in cash or card) takes place only in the hotel (here: Yangon, Myanmar).In fact - immediately after our booking confirmation - the hotel price was debited directly from the deposited credit card. In addition, a fee of 2% was charged for payment by credit card.We have complained to booking.com about both procedures. booking.com simply commented: the hotel is entitled to collect the amount at any time. And, the additional charge of 2% is stated in the ""small print"" of this hotel.A serious travel platform discloses such cost-relevant information in clear and complete form before the customer confirms the booking.

I got charged three different times for the hotel I was staying at, amounting to about 400 dollars over what I should have paid. The hotel staff was very helpful and equally confused as to why I'd be charged so much, especially since the charges were all slightly different amounts. I immediately called my bank and contested the transactions, with the hotel staff agreeing I only should have been charged once. We pieced together that the most likely culprit for the extra deductions on my account was booking.com, since the hotel itself only charged me once, yet the two extra charges also showed up as ""hotel"" on my card around the same time I checked in. If I hadn't noticed and called my bank when I did, Booking.dom would have  robbed me 388 dollars. Ya'll be careful out there.        "	                1	1	Saturday	booking	negative

637	            I have been using Booking.com for years and, as in marriage where live runs smoothly, I had no complaint as there were no problems with the hotels on their site. This time, though, there was a highly dishonest Austrian guy who rents a flat in Austria. The moment I booked, he charged my credit card, and this is an incorrect practice, as there was free cancellation for another two months, so why take the money immediately? Booking.com should not allow this to happen! Then, two days later I cancelled the reservation, and this highly fraudulent hotel owner took ONE MONTH to reimburse me the money he was so incredibly quick to charge me. The problem was that during this one full month, I had to ring six times Booking.com and their only reply was that they would contact the flat owner and ask him whether he has done the reimbursement. Also, every time I would get different information from the customer service advisors! One said I would be reimbursed by Booking.com the very next day if the flat owner did not pay, another advisor told me I would need to wait for a month! Also, when I asked to speak with a manager, twice they told me there is no manager available to talk to me. Only during my SIXTH phone call there was miraculously a manager who had the benevolence to talk to me, as the advisors were just not able to get my money back and would not commit in any way that I would get the due reimbursement. In the end, I got my money back, but it took a month, many hours on the phone and Booking.com has revealed itself as a company who only backs the hoteliers and do not give a toss about the hotel guests!!! As I said, I have used them very often, but this incidence showed me that once there is the slightest disagreement with a fraudulent hotel owner, do not expect any backing from Booking.com, they just keep saying what good hoteliers their clients are!!!

No where near as nice as previously booked but the same price.Once we got to our new stay, we found out that the previous place we had booked was actually not opened for business and had no signs of opening any time soon, yet booking.com had only gave us less than 24hours notice of this. So booking.com had lied about why we had to be relocated. So what was meant to be a nice trip turned out to be more stressful than it was worth.        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

Strangely after a couple of days the ""owner"" of the villa contacted me via Booking and asked to be called on WhatsApp. Long story short, the owner wanted me to book the villa through another website rather than Booking. This was alarming and I quickly contacted Booking telling them about the issue.Time went and after 2 weeks(!) just 4 weeks the planed trip (which is next week) booking.com sent a short message where they had canceled the booking due to ""ended collaboration with the listing"". They kindly sent me a link over ""other similar listings""... Well, first of all, everything is sold out.Secondly, none of the listings where even close to the same standard.Thirdly, 2 of my closest friends got so scared they booked another vaccation.So, I now sit with 5 tickets without any ackommodation last week in July.

She said she would ring the hotel to confirm the cancellation and I'd be refunded by booking.com, at that time she said they'd ring me back once she had confirmation. Fast forward 2 hours and I receive an email (not a phone call) saying I can't cancel as it's a non-refundable booking. This was an error on Booking.coms side and I'm now paying for it, literally.

Nevertheless I had a very frustrating experience as one of the places I had booked apparently had been double-booked from the Hotel's side, why Booking.com wanted to relocate us. I appreciate their service in finding a new spot and even wanting to refund us for the price difference, but after looking at our options, we decided to just cancel our booking (as we could still do that freely) and then go for Airbnb instead. Therefore I wanted to go in and manage our booking and cancel it totally, but what do you know? The button where you are supposed to click to cancel your booking was removed! (easy way for Booking.com to hold on to their money, but I knew my rights) I had no chance of cancelling the booking, so I had to call their customer's service, where the employee luckily was very helpfull and quick to cancel the booking, so I will give her credit for that. But I still think it is dirty business from Booking.com's side to just take away the button and thus my right to cancel the booking by myself, thus trying to force me to keep the booking? What big businesses don't do to keep their money... wow!        	                5	3	Friday	booking	neutral

The hotel even called them on my behalf to contact me to resolve the issue. This didn't happen. I called them numerous times,  still no resolution. I ended up calling the hotel again who confirmed that booking.com had cancelled my reservation earlier that day ( their own customer reps didn't realise this) l honestly have no idea how they function.

660	            I booked a room at a hostel through booking.com, but the reservation didn't go through, and I waited just in case for confirmation from my bank or an email. None arrived so I waited a bit and tried again. The reservation was successful the second time, and this time I received a message from my bank about the transaction and a confirmation email from booking.com. However, it wasn't one email I received, but two emails stating I had made two reservations, and cancelling one would incur fees. As the rooms were non-refundable I tried calling the hostel, emailing them, etc., repeatedly for a few days to call about what seemed like a technical glitch. No one answered, and what was odder was that I later found another hostel by a different name on booking.com, but with the exact same pictures of the room I had booked and the same phone number (the addresses were slightly different). I finally resorted to calling booking.com and asked them to cancel one of my reservations, as I had only made one reservation, and it was clearly some sort of error. They said they could only do that if the hostel allowed it. They emailed me back saying the hostel refused to cancel one of my 2 reservations, and that I would have to pay a cancellation fee, which was the full price of the room. On top of that, when I queried them over the bizarre coincidence of two separate properties having the same photos and same phone number, the lady on the phone said not to worry. She often saw this, and that owners of more than one property sometimes just used the same photos for different properties. I found the answer too odd to respond as I was mainly concerned with not being charged for cancelling a room I did not book. Unless the two properties happen to be identical - why would you use the same photos of one property to advertise another? Isn't that misleading if one of the properties look different, regardless of whether you owned both? Shouldn't booking.com check to make sure the property is as advertised? In either case, the last two days have been a nightmare trying to deal with not being charged for an additional reservation or even cancellation for a reservation I did not make. Reading other people's reviews on various websites, on Facebook, etc., it's awful to find out that other people have had a similar experience (getting emails that you booked twice when you didn't and being forced to pay some sort of cancellation fee for a reservation you didn't make), or unexplained, unauthorised charges made even after you've paid. I thought booking.com, being owned by the same company as agoda or priceline, would be trustworthy. You would think the company would take the feedback into consideration after all this time and try to change, but I guess it's too lucrative a business model swindling people. I remember asking the woman from booking.com over the phone if reservations made twice like this were common, as by that point I had googled them and found other people having had the same experience. She insisted no. Don't use booking.com unless you like being caught in a Kafkaesque, Catch-22 of being unable to cancel without paying for a non-refundable room you did not book.        	                1	1	Thursday	booking	neutral

I was then charged the full fee of £331 from the apartment and they called it a ""no show"" They're scam artists with hidden fees and booking.com were not helpful at all about the situation, generally choosing the side of the apartment/hotel as this is who pays them.Stay well clear.

665	            I have been a frequent user of booking.com for many years.  However, recently I have had several issues with them.  Firstly, I was charged for some unknown payments.  I had to call on numerous occasions and chase with emails.  After 3 weeks, they didn't know what the charge was for, but they finally said they would refund me.  I am still waiting for the money at the moment but hopefully will get it soon.Secondly, I was given an offer to get 20 GBP if I made a booking with a special link they sent me.  I followed the instructions exactly, but there is nothing on my account about my 20 GPB. I have again emailed and tried calling several times.  They just ignore my emails and the 'local' phone number does not work.  I therefore had to call an international number. After 15 minutes on hold, I finally got through to someone.  The operator said he would call me back immediately but never did, so I have to call again and waste even more money on international calls.  The amount of time and money I have wasted chasing money they have incorrectly charged me, I could have booked plenty more hotels.  I think I will start looking at other options for booking my hotels from now on.        	                13	2	Wednesday	booking	negative

I booked two hotels through them on the same day with the same saved credit card details and 2 weeks before I was due to travel one of my bookings got cancelled due to 'invalid credit card details'. Strangely, the other one went through fine! I was emailed at 10pm on a Saturday with notice to update my details and by 11am Monday the booking was cancelled. The hotel then put the room back up for sale for 3x the price and I was told I would have to rebook at today's rates. After 3 days of complaints booking.com told me that if I went to my bank to provide proof that the payment was never requested they would reinstate my booking or they would arrange a different property. I took the morning off work and provided proof however the booking was not reinstated and they offered me one hotel which was way below the standard of the initial room I'd booked (king suite with terrace overlooking the sea to a double room with no balcony) when I declined that offer the woman repeated the same thing to me for half an hour that I shouldn't have been offered the second one in the first place!

678	"            The website looks great,  the location is pretty and the room was comfortable.The service, however, was so bad it made me laugh...I arrived (6.30pm) to find a chap pacing up and down outside on his phone clearly not having a good day. I walked in and reception can be found with a little effort by asking the other guests where it is and then waiting for pacing man to check me in. That done he said "" I'll show you to your room, got your bag..good..this way"" and he was gone, 10 steps ahead pointing to where breakfast is held (another story) and how to use a door late at night. He turned to see what was taking me so long and why I was struggling over steps with a heavy  bag . He was walking fast ahead opened the door to the room, checked that the bathroom was still in existence and was gone. The restaurant was quite busy and pacing man was flying around the diners along with friendly waitress who was also flying around. Food was average, fish well cooked but the chowder it was served on, was not. They never asked how the food was perhaps they already knew.Perhaps breakfast will be better?Breakfast is served from 8-10am and is in an annex whilst the rest of the Inn and its staff are locked away from their guests.A querulous response from the cook after my asking if there were any papers, ""no there ain't any, do you want breakfast? "" (it's 9.15am) ""thanks I'll sit inside"", every table had been used with no attempt to clean them, mine a table for 2 had one space laid over a dirty and sticky surface. Most of the food had gone with no chance of being replenished, the yogurt was warming up nicely and the butter had melted, the cereal was soft, brown bread has to be asked for, eggs were offered and declined. The food on hot plate had seen better days and the baked beans looked like mortar. The lady in charge of her domain was clearly short staffed and came from the school of ""I'll do it later"". But wait...I am leaving the best till last. There was a small wedding party staying in the Inn and a hairdresser had set up her stall in the middle of the eating area, and proceeded to fix the hair of the bride and bride maids in front of and close to the diners. One guest asked the cook what was going on and she replied "" wedding party, you know how it is"". Really you couldn't write it. This inn is not small, surely they could have set up the hairdresser in a more appropriate spot, still it could had been worst it could have been in the kitchen. An inspector would have had a field day. At 11.30 having  just passed the breakfast ""shed"" to go to my taxi, and the tables has still not been cleared??My suggestion is book this Inn if you come in late and have to leave early and then it's fine.

679	            Booked a room for £115 only to be advised on the morning of travel that it was a mistake and should have been £342 we were then held over a barrel to pay a finally re negotiated price of £200 which we did as it was a short 1 night break and we did not want to spend the whole day trying to find new accommodation that was close to where we needed to stay and the area was very booked up due to a big event.  We have since been advised that if the price had been clearly too cheap i.e £1.15 it could have been easily identified as an error as this was not the case and there were other rooms in the vicinity which were cheaper or similar price it seemed a genuine offer.  We looked at the offer and accepted it and gave our card details at the time of booking we have been advised this makes it a legally binding contract I will be following it through further now we are back home, I will not be confident to use this company again as I do not know if the offer I accept will be genuine.        	                1	1	Sunday	booking	neutral

683	            I was looking to book accommodation for three people using their no pre-payment method. I booked one room which proved inappropriate for my family so I cancelled it well within the time period allowed. I then booked at another place which I also had to cancel as I realised it had a double bed and single bed rather than three single beds. I checked my bank account a couple of days later and saw that money had been taken for both accommodations - £3 for one and £12 for another. These were taken AFTER the bookings were cancelled.These were not pre-authorisations - they were pre-payments which I had to jump over hoops to get refunded. The fact that this happened to two separate hotels means that this has now become some sort of policy between booking.com and the hotels/b&amp;b's etc. This NEVER used to happen. Now if you book accommodation EVEN IF IT SAYS NO PRE-PAYMENT - you had better expect to pay - either a small amount, 10% OR the whole amount. Simply look at the other reviews below stating the same thing.They used to be a good company but now they could care less - the only thing they are concerned with is profit and positive reviews. I am considered a frequent traveller on their website. Not any more - not with them.        	                25	1	Friday	booking	positive

685	            Booking.com would not let me post a review on their site so putting it here.  Apparently it didn't meet their guidelines. I feel other people need to know I was ripped off.I booked a room with an airport shuttle and no cancellation allowed.  Fine. What my problem was is that after I booked a room at Park nine resort near Bangkok airport I was told I had to photo copy my credit card back and front and email it to a 3rd party who dealt with their airport shuttles. Not happy about that.  They wouldn't let me pay the driver cash either.  I had my 2 year old with me so the transport to the hotel was important.  As I was mislead !!! I requested my money back but no such luck.  It was not stated ANYWHERE you had to photo copy credit card details and email to a third party airport shuttle company otherwise I would not have booked. I stayed somewhere else and lost a nights accommodation at Park nine hotel. Who requests a photocopy of credit cards these days???   Who knows what happens to those card details later. And no.  I wouldn't trust anyone. As I said.  Booking.com would not allow me to post this.  Never using them again. I'd like my money back for the room I couldn't use and details updated or changed in regards to paying for parknines shuttle busses. It's your job to ensure details are correct on Your site.

687	            I’ve used booking.com for years and never had an issue so when I needed to organise a trip for a group of friends I didn’t think anything about using them again. How wrong could I have been!! I always make a point of choosing somewhere with free cancellation and no prepayment.  I booked an apartment in Madrid and then cancelled it the next day because I couldn’t get the flights out there . When I looked at my bank account the full amount had been taken from my account the same day I had booked it which I wasn’t expecting. Contacted booking.com and they weren’t interested and told me to contact the property directly. When I contacted the property they said payment was always taken in full and it would take 30 days to issue a refund which booking.com were fully aware of.  It’s now well over the 30 days no amount of calls or emails get a response and I’m almost £1000 out of pocket. I’m shocked and disgusted by their total lack of interest. To add insult to injury I’ve lost count of the amount of emails I receive on a daily basis asking me to refer a friend or have I thought about where I’m going for my next trip. They are seriously taking the proverbial. I will never be using them again!!        	                1	1	Thursday	booking	negative
688	            I have used Booking.com on many occasions but have never until now needed to contact them for any issues. I booked an apartment through them in France and on arrival the apartment was in an appalling condition, it had clearly been flooded which had caused the laminate floor to lift in many places and also have bits of flooring missing which was in my opinion a trip hazard.  It was also not very clean with a large stain on the sofa, broken mirror and just nothing like the photos on Booking.com. We didn’t stay in the apartment and booked a hotel. I contacted Booking.com and spoke/emailed with a number of advisors and I also contacted the apartment agent directly but they failed to respond to my emails. Booking.com have advised me that the agent will only refund two of the three night stay I had booked which I believe is unacceptable given the fact we didn’t stay there at all and because of the condition of the apartment.  Booking.com have said it is not their decision which I understand and accept but what I am unhappy about is despite providing photographic evidence of the appalling state of the floor and Booking.com knowing the agent has not responded to my complaint is still allowing the agent to advertise the property with them knowing full well any guests will be met with the conditions we were.        	                2	2	Thursday	booking	negative

They called the facility, and the manager told them that they offered me numerous rooms to change but I wasn't satisfied with the rooms and refused them. He never offered me a new room. First they told me all of the rooms were booked for the weekend, then he asked me did I want to check out of the hotel that I would find that all of the hotels are having insect problems because it I summertime and hot. Booking.com ran with ihis lies and closed my complaint within tem minutes even when I sent pictures of the dead and live bugs. They even dismissed that I had to take my son to the ER to be treated for painful infected bug bites. Would NEVER IN LIFE use them again.

693	            We recently booked three hotels through booking.com and really liked the hotels we stayed at.  We had decent prices and everything worked well.  The problem is that booking.com charged our credit card almost $200 and we don't know why.  We paid for each hotel at the hotel so we can't understand why the extra charge.  We have submitted numerous documents and each time we are told we need to submit something else.  When we tell them those documents have already been submitted, they say they don't have them.  We cannot get any answers.  After weeks of submitting and resubmitting documents, we contacted our credit card company and had to cancel our credit card.  We will not use this company again because they are not trustworthy, adding extra costs without explanation.        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	positive
694	            I have used the site for 15 years and now is the first sign that my initially favorite site is declining in its service. I have booked a hotel for 5 people and 1 day before my arrival i received notification that it is cancelled due to invalid card. My card is OK and i can prove that in the bank. Also, if there is a problem, i would assume that I receive a call, as otherwise it is not clear why the phone number is taken. Also cancellation 1 day before the arrival makes it really difficult for 5 people to find another option. This said, i can assume that some misunderstandings can happen. However booking.com can be then the guarantee of the adequate replacement and/or compensation of the losses. This is the main purpose of such sites, I suppose. However i can say that I didnt receive any financial support from booking.com and i had to find the new option myself. And I paid it with the exactly the same credit card which was declined.        	                1	3	Tuesday	booking	neutral

Sat in the reception of our 5* hotel crying only to have to wait for them to call us back offering lesser alternatives and watch other customers checking in staring at us. 4 hours later we had to call them and ABISMAL customer service rep hung up on my husband. As we were in the region and too far from home we felt forced to accept alternative unattended lesser standard B&amp;B which took a further 30 mins to get someone to come and let us in and were told we have to pay for this.

699	            RESTAURANT CLOSED FOR DINNER WITHOUT WARNING OR NOTICE This was unfortunately a really poor experience. This was meant to be our first family holiday with our 6 month old baby daughter. We booked this hotel as it says it has a restaurant. This enables us to get our baby to sleep and eat on-site.This was booked via booking.comOn arrival the hotel manager Marcelo informed us that the restaurant would only be available for breakfast and they would not be serving dinner that night. He suggested a restaurant in the local village.The next afternoon we asked again about dinner and again Marcelo told us that the restaurant isn’t open and they won’t be serving dinner. We asked what days they will open for dinner and he said they would not open at all. We decided at this point that we couldn’t stay for another 5 nights as the hotel have stated the restaurant won’t be open for dinner. This as one of the main reasons we booked this hotel. Travelling each night for dinner was a major inconvenience and disruption to our baby’s routine. We spent 2 nights in total out of the 7. I spoke to booking.com and expressly asked them not to contact the hotel as I wanted to speak with them personally first. Booking.com disregarded this instruction and contacted the hotel. The next morning Marcelo said I had to wait to speak to the ‘director’ of the hotel.After over an hour waiting, I was told the director was in reception. There was no introduction and he was clearly physically angry, and immediately stated aggressively “This is your problem” and “There is a restaurant” and “You will pay in full”. I confirmed the reason we were checking out early and requested a refund for the remaining nights was because we booked this hotel as it had a restaurant on-site and had been told on the two previous days, the restaurant wasn’t and wouldn’t be open for dinner. The director continued to angrily state “You will pay for your booking”. After half an hour I received a call from booking.com who stated that the hotel would refund 100 EUR (25% of the cost of the remaining nights). I refused this as we had been mis-sold and felt deceived. A restaurant is clearly listed in the facilities of the hotel and they publish photos and reviews about the dinner served. Some time later booking.com accepted the hotel’s fictitious explanation that dinner had to be requested 24hrs in advance for them to open the restaurant. Not once did the hotel staff, director, booking.com, hotel website, or printed signage on-site provide this instruction.  Booking.com were quick to shout their no-liability policy for accuracy of Trip Provider’s description of facilities. This completely goes against the first point of their Code of Good Practices: “We care about you”, let alone their promise that “We help you” and “We hear you”. More fiction I suppose.        	                1	1	Monday	booking	negative

704	            NEVER TRUST THE INFORMATION POSTED ON BOOKING.COM WEBSITE:Like everyone else, I went to book a hotel for my trip to Saint Petersburg with my friend wishing to have a great time and amazing experience. I was looking for a good hotel and found one that is supposed to be in the center, very well advertised, and rated as a 3 star hotel. We traveled from Prague to Saint Petersburg, there was a delay and we arrived super tired but we know that the hotel will be in the center as we checked in the information provided in Booking.com.  Once we arrived, we have not found any hotel in the area, it took us 30 min on foot and after asking many locals and staff from cafe, we were sent to a narrow street where the hotel is situated. The hotel was advertised as 3 start and with view on the river but the only view we got is a dirty wall and dark narrow street. We were advised that the reception is open but there was no one there and we were calling many times but without an answer. We had to wait like 3 hours in the street then someone came and opened for us the door. The hotel room was too small, there was no kitchen open or anything from advertised. The biggest disappointment though is the way I was treated by customer support of Booking.com, sending me to write a feedback to the hotel by myself without realizing they are the ones responsible for the content provided on the website and they should take down such scams from the list of hotels. To sum up, nothing was suitable and no one could take responsibility. Will never book there again and will never recommend it to anyone I know.        	                2	1	Monday	booking	negative

So we started again to try get in touch with them( already 10 o'clock in the evening by now) and when finally answer they just hang up saying that is nothing that they can do about it!!!        	                1	1	Sunday	booking	neutral

711	            I placed my rental property on Booking.com.  I've been with VRBO and AirBnB for 6 yrs, no issues.  Booking.com won't allow new listings to accept prepayment or deposits, so the property owner has no security of any sort.  The 1st 4 out of 5 guests who booked all screwed me.  The 1st one refused to pay security deposit or cleaning fees at check-in or he would go to a hotel instead and because I had no cash deposit it was accept his terms or lose the booking at check-in altogether, a substantial amount of money.  The second guest was a 5 day booking, a No-Show.  Because I had no money down, I then had an empty property with no financial recourse.  The 3rd was non-responsive, phone number no good, etc and no cash down; I couldn't even confirm her stay, yet my calendar was blocked from other bookings by her booking.  My 4th booking thru them was coming from overseas, booked for 2 people, was bringing 7 total people to my home.  My calendar was blocked, it took me 2 weeks to get rid of this reservation to protect my property.  They told me I couldn't refuse a reservation that was already booked and that I had to allow the guest to arrive.  I finally was able to remove the reservation and have immediately cancelled my property from their site.

717	            Many years ago I was stuck in a blizzard outside of Regan National Airport in DC.  We searched and searched for a hotel and our corporate travel was no help at all.  With the very real prospect of sleeping in our car during a Noreaster I downloaded the booking.com app onto my iPad and found a hotel one mile away.  Knowing that that one mile drive would take over an hour and that we might have to abandon our rental car and walk we wanted to confirm our booking.  I booked the hotel room and then received an email that our booking would be confirmed in a few hours.  I called Booking.com and explained our situation to the very helpful rep and that my cell phone battery was about to die.  The Rep faxed our confirmation to the hotel and then personally called them to ensure that they received it and confirm that we had a room.  She called us back 10 minutes later and gave us the name of the manager and confirmed that we were all set.  It took us over 90 minutes to drive 1 mile in the storm but we arrived at the hotel safely and bunkered down for the night.All night long we heard sirens and the next day we saw cars off the road in ditches, big rigs jackknifed on the highway and cars all up an down the highway median that had been abandoned by drivers.My own corporate travel was unable to help me as they said they could not find a room and did not seem to understand that we were in dire straights.

This was a very bad experience and i would not recommend this rental agency!!!!  Their customer service is a lie and you can not contact them.

When I phoned she told me the room had an ""infestation"" and was uninhabitable but she could arrange an apartment up a dark side-street.

I called booking.com back about 10 times (each time a different customer service representative and I had to explain myself again) and not one had gotten back to me. They gave me the runaround. Then they wrote back a few days later claiming the refund had been issued on June 2nd. I waited for a few more days still no refund. I called back again, finally, someone from China told me they hotel refuse to honor the refund again and they offer me a credit for the hotel before the end of the year. I could not believe my ears because they had written me twice about the free cancellation and the supposedly refund processed.

We were told we'd be relocated withing an hour, I have sent photos and waited. at 15:45 with having no response from booking.com I called them back and was put through someone called SAM in the Branch in Germany (Berlin). He has advised we'd be relocated soon, we were not relocated till 17:30 and wasted way too many hours of our very short trip to Rome due to the negligence of the staff. I have then sent all the info for a refund on 26th May and the member of the team at booking.com did not say it was missing anything.then on the 28th May I get an email saying please submit documents for a refund. I then called them again not much luck.To cut the VERY long story short I did not receive a refund till 14th June after many hours spent on the phone and them giving the possibility for LES ARTES to mess me around.

Luckily that my wife called the property in advance and realize that there was something wrong with the booking  (or there will be big trouble when we arrive at the property). After several calls and emails with the property and booking.com, both parties approach us with two options. First, we are advised to cancel the booking before the property charge us. Second, we have to pay extra money for the reservation that we already booked in order to stay for 2 nights. If we don't choose 2 options above and arrive at the property the next day (even if with our confirmation paper), the property staff members would not let us stay because they said something wrong with booking system.Finally, we decided to cancel the booking after a long day of meaningless calls and emails from both booking.com and the property. This trip not only costs us flight tickets and transportation, but also time. Isn't holiday supposed to be fun and relaxing?Nevertheless, booking.com call us today (5 hours of our supposed-to-check-in time) saying they will compensate us the second day staying at the property for free. We already decided that we have enough of the frustration so we just say NO.        	                3	1	Thursday	booking	negative

Immediately I called the hotel who told me booking.com manage the refunds and cancellation, so I called booking only to be told nothing can be done and this happens more often than it doesn't. They told me the hotel would make the decision. I was passed back and forth between hotel and booking ubtil I eventually elevated to a service team leader at booking. They weren't at all helpful and told me idbe expected to pay the £140 for the apps mistake. Even worse, I only had 150 in my bank and booking had tool my last bit of accommodation money for a Booking I didn't even want and couldn't attend. This meant I actually had no money for accommodation on the day I actually needed it. The hotels always advise going direct through them as they'll always beat whatever booking offers and to be frank they're such a useless organisation when it comes to conduct, ethical trading and customer service I wouldn't even bother. Spend thousands a month with booking for my modelling contracts and for the sake of £140 they've lost me completely.

We arrived eight o'clock Saturday night on the train after a ten hour journey and made our way up and down some steep hills across town to that address only to find to our horror that it was a Guesthouse and they had never heard of our property!We didn't know what to think but luckily thanks to the kindness of the proprietors of the guesthouse and the help of a local passing by we discovered that it was in fact on Mount Street not far from the railway station where we had started from!We then had to make our way back across town. This was quite upsetting and annoying and considering our ages of 68 and 71 totally unnecessary effort and quite exhausting.It was after ten when we finally found the property and due to our then low levels of strength and concentration quarter to eleven before we gained access.I think this is a disgusting and disgraceful way to treat your customers.Is there no one employed by yourselves that actually checks your information is correct!The owner of this property was quite shocked by this when informed of this completely unnecessary mix up.We require at the very least an apology from yourselves as I imagine this totally avoidable mistake being splashed all over social media would be quite detrimental to your image.DisgustedlyTo date I have received NO reply or explanation from this company.In fact when we first got to the wrong address my immediate thought was that we had been scammed!Have just found my confirmation email for the reference number and when I looked the address given is now on Mount Street but still the wrong number so it would seem they have tried to change it, not said a word and still got it wrong!We will NOT be using this company again!!        	                2	1	Wednesday	booking	negative
744	            Worst customer service ever.Booked a hotel and canceled within the free cancelation period - even received an email confirming that. Booking apparently still forwarded my personal information including FULL credit card details to the hotel, which charged me. Chasing for 6 weeks to get my money back. You would think a serious company would apologize for the mistake and right the wrong. Instead, they have been pulling my leg, giving lie after lie after lie. According to their customer service representative, hotel was not responsive so after many days of waiting booking confirmed they will refund me on behalf of the hotel. They even told me not to contact my credit card company as this would be a conflict of interest, and they will take care of it.I waited all this ridiculously long time, during which they were keep telling me that refund is being processed, or to check with my bank in case they rejected the refund (?). Today, 6 weeks after my initial call, I was told the manager of the customer relations team to whom my case was escalated does not want to talk to me. With booking.com everything works smoothly until something goes wrong - then do not expect any level of help, assistance or even empathy.Time for airbnb.        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	negative
745	            We are a small tourist accommodation provider and completely share our customers' frustration with this most useless business that has ever existed on this planet. Booking.com took over the industry, abuse its monopoly and many of us are, in a way, forced to promote our accommodation business via booking.com. The staff is clueless, perhaps they are doing their best but the middle and top management are total crooks !!. Yes - crooks !... and that's where all the problems for both sides (customers/providers) come from - the management incl. their CEO Gillian Tans ! I can go on forever - they just need to be shut down by an EU consumer watchdog, of course if they do their job properly as well.        	                6	1	Tuesday	booking	neutral
746	            I booked the Winstonia hotel in Nairobi through “booking.com”, the advert stated it was near the airport, it wasn’t it took thirty mins to get there in a taxi.The taxi driver was surprised when I asked him to take me there. When we got close the taxi driver insisted on shutting the windows and locking the doors.On arrival at the hotel I was shocked by the area, it looked nothing like the pictures on “Booking.com”. The taxi driver told me this was the worst area of Nairobi and not safe. He didn’t want to get out of the car. I went to an alternative hotel. The taxi driver said a lot of tourists had “been conned” by “booking.com”.I wrote to “Booking.com” to make them aware of how misleading the Winstonia Hotel advert was, not only they couldn’t care less they marked my booking as cancelled so I couldn’t post a review.“Booking.com” are not to be trusted, any failings on their part they’ll refuse to discuss refunds but worse prevent you writing a review.        	                1	1	Monday	booking	negative

Booked a place for 3 days in London fully paid up via Booking.com only to get there to discover that the hotel could not honour the booking and had informed Booking.com but Booking.com hadn't bothered to inform me.Nor did they refund. They had to be called for the refund and they simply advised that it will take 10 days.Instant referral to Trading Standards.

748	            Booking.com is terrible! I booked a room for our Canada day vacation. We booked the Oakwood Resort for 2 evening with our family and kid. I got the confirmation number with the email. For this vacation, I purchased all the outfits for beach. And my kid was super excited for it! Then I called the hotel today (2 weeks after I booked the hotel on Booking.com). Just wanted to double confirm if the room was been reserved. Because this was the first time I placed order on Booking.com. The hotel manager told me that there was NO ROOM for us. Their room were all booked out since 1 month ago! They’ve asked Booking.com to contact me and let me know. But NO one from Booking.com contacted me! NO ONE! If I didn’t call the hotel, then on June 27th, Booking.com will charge me the full price for a room that is not existing! Then we went there without a room! And my family and my kid would have to sleep on the beach or the road!!!!!! I was super angry and called Booking.com. They said that happened some time. And that was really unfortunate! What!? Happened some times? It means Booking.com ruined so many families’ vacation which included mine!Until I called them, I still saw the room available for Oakwood Resort! That was terrible terrible terrible!Lucky that I have a habit to double check everything before I go! If not! You can imagine!So please never ever book anything on Booking.com! Or if you would like to be in trouble! Then go ahead! Good luck!        	                1	1	Monday	booking	negative

750	            What an unscrupulous outfit!!!!!!We booked a holiday villa in Italy and was subsequently told the original price was incorrect. Then after we reached a compromise deal on the price and agreed the dates we were told that the villa was no longer available for the requested period. On the back of this confirmed booking we outlaid 3700 Euro on flights and rental car! I spent a great deal of time making phone calls and sending emails to Booking.com but to no avail. They assured me that we're entitled to a villa of equivalent standard and that they would invoice the difference in price to the property we originally booked. A week or so later we were told they couldn't guarantee that we would be able to get the additional (i.e. excess over the originally agreed price) amount we may need to pay, back!Booking.com is a disastrous company and DO NOT deserve to be in business! You have been warned, use Booking.com at your own peril!!!!        	                2	1	Sunday	booking	neutral
751	            Have used booking.com as my main hotel booking website for stays over the past few years. On Friday I went to London with a reservation that was pre paid. Only to find out booking.com had made my reservation to another hotel (that I cancelled almost a month ago) and there was no booking information / card payments on the hotel I was meant to stay at system. this led me to missing out on a concert that I paid a nice sum of money to go to (which was the whole reason why I came to London in the first place) booking.com made the hotels trynmake up for their mess. There was no communication between hotel and booking.com, led me to get highly distressed in a city I haven’t been to before a fair bit away from home and no hotel to stay at. After missing my concert due to this issue, (I would not be aloud in with a bloody suitcase and bag) and no where to stay I had to purchase a train ticket home (which cost me £70!!!!)  I had already purchased a return for the next day. The cancellation I made was a free cancellation till the 14th of June (I always pay the £10/20 extra for this just in case) again I cancelled a month before (21st May) but it can’t of been that issue due to my account saying the hotel I didn’t cancel had been paid for and was not cancelled etc and the one I cancelled was canceleed without charge. So thank you booking.com on making me waste £200+ on train tickets and my concert that I had to miss. I will be hoping to get all the money I had to waste due to their c*ck up. Thank you for ruining my trip        	                3	1	Sunday	booking	negative

754	            Had problems with Booking.com on the last two occasions. First time they mislead the price of some accommodation (forgetting to add on taxes that were applicable). They accepted no responsibility for this. Second time they cancelled accommodation the day before my stay (despite booking this 6 month’s previous) because of a double booking. They did offer to pay the difference for alternative accommodation. I sent them the necessary documentation, now they are refusing to pay because they went full bank statements and are after my sensitive data. My claim is for £29!

758	"            I used booking.com to book a hotel for 2 nights in august, not the cheapest at £345. As far as I was aware, I booked and payment would be taken at the hotel which was fine with me as finances weren't immediately available. The next day full payment was taken from my account leaving me short for the rest of the month. I looked into it and thought it was a 'hold' that would be lifted in a few days. This didn't happen. I won't go into details of my circumstances, but needed to cancel. I was then told I was unable to get any kind of refund as I booked a cheap rate (£345 for 2 nights is not cheap in my view) and no option for a refund. I was also informed that it was not a hold charge and full payment had been made. I contacted the hotel whose first response was (direct copy from email)Accommodation’s comment:“Guest had the choice when booking. Guest chose non-refundable option.” Which they deem a suitable reply for someone not receiving a refund of £345 and to just go away.The hotel haven't been particularly helpful since, they offered to change date for a supplement which isn't an option due to the circumstances. They have not shown any sympathy and only seem capable of ""computer says no"" replies.        "	                1	1	Friday	booking	negative
759	            DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE...you will lose your money. We were stuck in Iceland in a blizzard where the national police service had to rescue us. We informed the property and booking.com regarding this and they neither sent us the check-in instructions nor refund us for the room we could not get to. They would not take any responsibility and ruined our entire trip in the process. This company does not care about its customers and does not follow proper customer service procedures. Also they do not have a vetting process for the properties listed on their website.

I have contacted them several times about this &amp; each time they say they have contacted the hotel &amp; the hotel will accept half the fee, My argument all the way through is that I only RESERVED &amp; did not book, as I would never book accommodation with full amount payable if you cancel.

I reported the problem to Booking.com when i returned home asking for a refund to be told I needed to report the problems immediately, rather than waiting until i go home.It wasn't until i threatened to contact my credit card company to get a refund that they agreed to refund me 1 of the 3 days I paid for, which i still think was a little below what I should have received but better than nothing.        	                5	3	Thursday	booking	neutral

I lodged a complaint and they claimed to have called me back but I had no missed calls. I phoned again today to get a gentleman who I can only say took the attitude that the customer is always wrong and terminated our call when I did not want to listen to his excuses.

768	            Worse Hotel Site experience of all time.As a seasoned traveller I have used Booking.com and other sites Hundreds of times. Indeed my status with Booking.com is ‘Genius, Frequent traveller’   But I don’t feel like a ‘Genius’ thanks to Booking.com?I booked a hotel for seven nights and made sure it was ‘Payment upon arrival’ For £154 UK Pounds.Shocked the next day my bank showed a Staggering £322 plus was taken by the Hotel that ignored the ‘Payment upon arrival’ and pricev literally charging me over double!After expensive phone calls to Booking.com where I had to prove my innocents with bank records etc etc the hotel admitted Fault. I was informed I had given all the documents required to get my money back, but days later new demands came from Booking.com for yet more documents from my bank.On the day of our Wedding I had to call Booking.com to try and resolve this and the American lady said “Go Yet married this can’t be resolved today!” Indifferently. Upset, delayed I went with my partner to get married.After the ceremony we had to go to our bank manager to get the Hand written, signed document Booking.com now insisted to try and get our money back.In talking to my bank the customer relations man stated he and his girl friend recently used Booking.com and had a similar experience where the hotel ignored the ‘Payment upon arrival’ and took a staggering £800  from his bank, months earlier to the day of travel that left them financially short.That evening after the Wedding etc I again sent these documents from my Bank manager etc and waited for a reply. Nothing came  I had to phone them again at Booking.com at their Amsterdam offices at great expense and upset the next day.While Booking.com now say again they have all the document they require I am forced to wait days longer for the hope that I will get my Money back, Only £321 a fraction of the costs and where only £154 was only ever supposed to be taken upon arrival by the hotel. Where is the Customers protections at Booking.com ?My Whole experience with Booking.com has left my Partner and I a ruined Wedding day, out of pocket expenses, expensive Mobile phone calls charges etc, and still waiting for my wrongly taken money.We wrote to the CEO Mr Gillian Tans but as with Booking.com a reply is yet to be afforded us.

769	            I know a lot of people have a lot of negative things to say about booking.com, and having a bad experience is likely to get people to review, but I had such a good experience that I had to review.  Booking.com really made a bad situation (which wasn’t their fault) into an amazing one. I booked somewhere in Vancouver for 4 nights, really nice apartment in good location and for my budget, was so happy, but then a few days later I’d had the reservation cancelled.. the host said something about the dates not being correct, and place not available. As Vancouver was selling out fast, and that being the only decent place left within budget, I was extremely upset, now having to find a new place. So I decided to call the helpline to see if they were allowed to cancel like that, (I’d have been penalised if I’d done it) their helpline is always open, another great thing about booking.com and staff always helpful. They told me no, they weren’t aloud to and if I’d like to find another place of the same facilities, they would reimburse me any extra costs. The first recommendation was not great, a 2 star, no parking etc so I found a place very similar to original booking but was £200 more. Anyway after I stayed at the new, amazing lovely place in replacement of original, I tell booking.com that I’ve stayed (could only get refund of difference after I stayed so yes, I did have to pay the extra up front) but 2 days later, the refund is in my account, pain free no hassle, exactly what they said they’d do. I’d read small print and followed instructions like they asked (to get refund) I see most negative experiences are down to people not reading small print. Amazing. I’m so grateful, the new place was better than original and it just made the whole thing extra special knowing I’d get some money back. So thank you booking.com, I think you’re great ;)        	                7	5	Wednesday	booking	positive

To make matters worse there was no free cancelation, I would have had to pay the full amount nevertheless. Anxious and afraid I called Booking.com customer service and was met almost instantly by a representative. He was very polite, extremely professional, and was also understanding of my issue. He asked if he could put me on hold while contacting the hotel I had booked. Within a matter of minutes I was back on the phone with him and he confirmed my cancelation free of charge!

772	            Made a booking through booking.com specifically based on location, choosing an apartment walking distance to all major Nashville attractions (around 0.5 miles). The location was shown on the booking.com map and the distances were quoted in their description of the place based on the map location. When we arrived at the apartment we immediately contacted booking.com to let them know the property was in a completely different location over 2 miles away! We only had 1 day in Nashville so this completely messed up our plans. We asked to be rebooked to the right location to a hotel or apartment of similar quality as advertised, or to refund our booking as we did not receive the service we had booked for, which was centrally located accommodation. I won’t go through all the back and forth but basically their customer service was deliberately slow witted to try and dodge any responsibility and tire us out. Ultimately, we are left reporting them to external agencies for their poor behaviour and to hold them accountable.

It made me lose one day of holiday.Moreover, I recently have had many reservations with booking and it is happening to arrive at the hotel which tries to give a different price than shown on Booking. It has become common to book more than one in the city and move if negotiating is not possible.I complained to Booking and after 5 email seems nobody even try to understand the real issue and tries to tell me ""your reservation will be refunded"".

I remember how several years ago I got in similar situation in Russia when a host set status ""no show"", but on the next day after status was changed to correct one with help of booking.com support.(*) With start of summer holiday season in Batumi, Georgia almost every last property owner I've stayed in asked me to cancel booking and pay them directly. booking.com have to be aware that such booking cancellation are fake and cannot be trusted, but they do not care:on this small market booking.com is a monopolistIn this case owner's assistant Hatuna even stated that cancellation of booking is free for me though it was not!booking number 1470409647 Hotel ""Orbi Sea Tower Flat"" in city of Batumi The only ID is phone number +995 555 43 43 77 address is Khimshiashvili, 15 block A, 5th floor room 5-08        "	                3	1	Sunday	booking	negative

At this last minute especially during peak season, it was panic station trying to find alternatives. Furthermore, Booking.com's email stated that I can only file a claim AFTER my trip in which case, I would have to spend all the extra money first before they will ""consider"" my claim.Anyway, when I went onto Google review attempting to leave my review of Milth, I was shocked to see a list of other victims scammed in exactly the same way! Even though I'm annoyed but if my cancellation was due to a genuine reason, that's understandable, but it seems it's all a big scam by Milth, yet booking.com is still happy to take bookings on behalf of a ongoing scam!

Can't do it was their reply but if you pay 200 pounds for the first night somebody will let you in at 10am on the second. So they are technically telling us to sleep on the beach on the first night and check in at 10am. Even though they informed me strictly they can not change check in times. Customer services are completely useless obviously hiring employees who are used to dealing with irate customers and not giving an inch. Instead of being sensitive to customers problems.

They would request a refund I cancelled my hotel through the site.  I was then informed the hotel would not refund me and even when I called the hotel they were so so so rude and kept saying that they didn’t know what I was talking about.  Bookings called me today and said that they had lost the money and I could not even get the original booking back or change the date or anything.   Their inconsistency on the information made me incredibly upset.  When asking to speak to a manager she refused and said “my manager want speak to you, am dealing with you”. Well did was a bit peed to say the least.  I then just kept on asking to speak to her manager.  After raising her voice she said she was going to cut me off. Again and again asked to speak to her manager. I have now been on hold for 20 mins already. ( their hold music is driving me mad). Ahhhhh.        	                28	1	Friday	booking	negative

789	            I've been managing a B &amp; B for several years in the perhaps most beautiful and fascinating area of ​​Salerno and, supporting Booking.com, as a partner for the intermediation of guests and for spreading the image of my structure, through a hard and exhausting work I have achieved significant successes and satisfactions. Unfortunately, following the stay by some Argentine guests, in which among other things sheets, bedspreads and the floor of antique terracotta were stained with fruits and foods, I received a negative review with a score of 4.2 out of ten.In this review my b &amp; b has been described as a place without services, without a supermarket, without a meter and with additional costs for everything. In fact, not only have I accompanied guests  to park in free places, even though they had not announced their arrival in the car, but I helped them navigate the multitude of shops and services without demanding anything. The most absurd thing is that at the  plebiscite place, just 60 meters from the b &amp; b there is the large supermarket of the Conad and about 70 meters, in Via Vernieri the metro stop. When I called Booking.com to look for protection from a review with false and false descriptions that damaged my structure in the image, the operators told me that we need to protect the transparency of guest reviews. When I described the situation they told me that  95/100 score I dropped from that of 97/100 is already quite high. I will continue to work with this partner but with the awareness of having to take care of the image of my structure.        	                3	1	Thursday	booking	positive
790	            My fiance and I stayed in a b&amp;b in Siracusa which we booked on booking.com. We paid by cash upon arrival at the property. A couple of weeks later, I checked my credit card statement and there was a charge for £100 from a DIFFERENT b&amp;b - Camere Cavour, Ortigia - which we had simply VIEWED on booking.com before deciding to reserve the other place. I checked my email for any booking confirmation, wondering if I had clicked in error or something, but there was nothing regarding Camere Cavour, only the property we actually stayed at. After reading all the reports of fraud from Booking.com, I went directly to the bank and reported the theft, avoiding the run around from these scammers.

It was our honeymoon trip and since we had to leave to Singapore we left 2 of our large luggages at the hotel reception and due to a Visa problem we couldn't get back to the hotel but still we informed the management that we will get it back soon unfortunately it took about 2 months for us send a person there as we didn't know anyone from Malaysia but now the irresponsible management says that our luggages are been lost and the management is changed. How on earth could a foreigner trust this country and this hotel. We most of all trusted this site and over everything the hotel management doesn't reply to any of the emails and doesn't even answer the phone even if they answer the way they speak is very irresponsible. The luggage is worth 2000 ringt and is filled with most of our memories. Can anyone help us on this issue please.  And find an answer as in where our luggages are. We would be very glad if someone finds our luggages for us. Even we are helpless to file a case against the hotel but we are trying our best on it. Thanking the management of booking.

800	            My issue with Booking.com is that you cannot leave a review for a hotel you do not stay at.  In this instance the hotel confirmed my booking in November 2017 and then in May 2018 advised they had double booked me.  This has left me totally inconvenienced.As I see it, part of the experience is the smooth and professional handling of the booking.  If a hotel is unable to undertake this competently, I should be able to leave feedback to allow other potential customers to avoid such an issue.  Booking.com need to amend their policy in this respect to ensure they protect their customers and not just the establishments that pay their contributions.I do acknowledge that Booking.com have emailed with other alternative venues and an offer to refund costs incurred.  This is clearly a step in the right direction but two points.  One, the issue is one of being able to leave feedback and, secondly, I note another recent review saying that a similar offer was made but it involved considerable arguing and phone time.  If this is the case, my view is it is not worth it.  I have queried this with Booking.com and they have replied by offering me more alternatives.  In other words, not answering the question.  This seems to be a common pattern with both Booking.com and Hazelwood Country House, Adare.        	                3	1	Tuesday	booking	neutral

They sent an email cancelling one of my “confirmed” bookings, made several months before, just a few days before we were due to set off for a road trip in the Outer Hebrides. No explanation, no offer of alternative accommodation. All other stages of our trip and ferry crossings were booked, so there was no possibility of changing our itinerary. The only alternative accommodation we were able to find at this late stage was much more expensive –a cottage for six for the pair of us.  In total we are about £250 out of pocket, including a new £39 booking fee. I put it to booking.com that they should come up with some compensation.

805	            I planned and organised a suprise trip for my husband’s birthday and I was excited to treat him to some luxury in Marbella, in hope of getting a break.Upon arriving we were greeted by the heavy sound of drilling, construction works and large trucks. We originally thought the driver brought us to the wrong hotel…Needless to say we where left astounded by condition of the hotel, and we really thought our holiday was ruined from that point onwards as we had little in the way of notification of the heavy construction works.From this point it became obvious that the photos were not a true representation of the pictures on booking.com and upon checking again on the website are actually computer generated images! After researching on trust pilot this seems to be a very common issue of using computer generated images of the hotel.Me and husband tried to locate a member of staff as the builders couldn’t understand us, so we proceeded to wonder around the grounds to find a small shop like dwelling that had a desk in, which happened to be reception. Me and my wife couldn’t believe the deceit, and were both thoroughly disappointed.The large part of the day was spent waiting for call backs from the booking.com customer service agents. The first 2 agents were moderately polite however our 3rd phone call was from a lady whom immediately was aggressive with me on the phone, even though stating the photos were ‘fake’ still continued to argue we cannot cancel therefore forcing us into a contract that was misrepresentation of what we saw on the photos.By this magnitude booking.com would be breaching the ‘The Misrepresentation Act 1967’ (which exists to protect consumers from false or fraudulent claims that induce you into buying something or entering into a contract. It also allows you to claim damages.) and is also breaching the ‘Unfair Terms in Consumer Regulation 1999’.The whole controversy was stressful and cost us days of our holiday on my husbands birthday, not to mention the monetary loss from extra taxis, phone calls from abroad and being forced to rebook at an expensive hotel due to the last minute booking.It seems as if this is an issue with booking.com as a whole, as other providers use the old and current photos from the hotel in qeustion        	                3	1	Sunday	booking	negative

A week or so later I received some suggestions about properties in the area I might be interested in. Deleted the spam, then it dawned on me I might not have a booking. Checked my in box, my booking.com reservations, spam etc and there was nothing so I went air bnb and got a cheaper place in Falkirk. On the day we arrived in Falkirk the owners of the original property text and asked when we were arriving! I explained the position. They said they had emailed me, but it had bounced back. After calling Booking.com, they had the wrong email for me and their confirmations had bounced back, but since this was an automatic process they couldn’t do anything. The problem was mine as I had entered the wrong email address apparently. I have an account with them, and have used them before so how did a wrong address get through? The call centre were no help and after 35 minutes and not being allowed to talk to a supervisor I hung up. Never using them again.        	                3	1	Sunday	booking	negative

810	            I've used Booking.com previously with decent results but had big problems with a recent stay booked in Cortona, Italy.  I booked a hotel over 2 months in advance.  Less than 2 weeks prior to departure, Booking.com sent me an email saying that they couldn't honor my reservation.  I called them and told them to cancel the reservation and refund my money.  They said that wanted to make it right and offered a couple of other alternatives.  I accepted one that looked nice and got good reviews.  It was almost twice the price of the original hotel but I was told on the phone and via email that, after the stay, I should send the receipt to Booking.com and they would 'do their best' to reimburse me for the difference.  The hotel was nice and the final price was 40 euros less than listed.  Once I provided the receipt to Booking.com I got no response.  I sent another email and was denied any refund.  I called and was offered $25 USD for the 184 euro difference.  When I declined this, they said they'd call me back the next day; this never happened.  After a week, I called them back, spent over 40 minutes on the phone going over the situation and on hold before I was offered 49 euros to go away.  I'll accept this as I don't believe they'll do any more to meet their obligation but I am far from satisfied and don't plan on providing Booking.com with any more of my business.        	                1	1	Thursday	booking	positive

It might be true booking.com lists more properties but the the properties are not vetted, but some properties have a Star rating (between 1-5 stars) on them.Booked a 3 star property in Bradford in Mar/18 for 4 nights. It turned out to be a students accommodation, hosted in one of the students hall of Bradford University. Experience was not altogether bad - but the sink in the communal kitchen was blocked, and there was no toilet rolls in the bathroom, and not supplied even when requested. I accordingly left a mixed feedback, to which the host, rather than responding to my feedback at booking.com sent a message to my mobile directly ""Excuse me but where on our ad did i tell you we have house keeping? Where did you get your information that our property is student accommodation? I charged you £18 a night what did you expect?? Next time i will not accept your booking please get a better job and pay for a hotel!!!"".I subsequently asked booking.com on what basis the Star ratings of properties determined. The response was ""Please note, as a general reference, that a star rating system seek to assess Hotel quality. The criteria for the attribution of the stars may vary per country. For general reference, the properties determine and check their classification with their local tourism authorities."". Even after complaining the Star rating of the property was not reviewed despite other guests leaving feedback e.g ""Condescending, patronising, rude""..It is surprising that some professionally managed hotel are advertised as 2-Star.

816	            Love this site. I use it regularly to look for short trips, weekends away, or hotels for weddings etc. I like that it emails prompts when the prices change as often we won’t have a certain preference on where we’d like to stay so if I search a few areas and one is later better value the site notifies me. This also worked well when we stayed away this weekend as I had already booked a hotel with free cancellation and as I had been emailed that prices had gone down I cancelled the one I had reserved with no charge and booked another one cheaper.On occasion I have found some better prices on trivago but I generally prefer booking.com.I would say sometimes not all info is as clear as it could be. For instance whether breakfast is included in the price or whether it is an add on. Also one of the hotels we booked had a swimming pool and spa and we planned to use the pool with our baby.

818	"            good offering, but functionalities, BUT... applying cheap scams on listing:to get more lead traffic , when going trough tripadvisor they will show a lower price than the actual one, by ""excluding"" (hiding) a list of costs which are in no way neither optional nor variable.These costs are represented in misleading way, and you are never shown the actual total you will finally pay.If you instead go directly to Booking.com they will normally show the final price, showing that have all the information, and it's just their design decision to hide part of the price for users coming from Tripadvisor.Cheap tricks that cannot be forgiven        "	                1	3	Monday	booking	negative
819	            Booked a stay in Mexico. Hotel was nice but construction work going on right outside my window- workers literally overlooking my bedroom. I complained to the hotel at the time and booking.com were copied into this. After my stay I sought compensation for the noise and disturbance but they said I should have got it from the hotel owner while there and washed their hands of it. Their site didn’t advertise or warn of works and they didn’t care about the guest experience- just that they weren’t responsible- for anything.

820	"            DONT BE FOOLEDThe booking experience is relatively hassle free, the problems begin when you have an unexpected glitch, like the property you booked in good faith and paid good money for turns out to be a dump.The representation of some properties are completely false, for example I booked a family villa near Palma, Mallorca specifically because it was ""beach front"", the pictures shown in the ad were of a deck that allowed you to walk directly onto the beach and the description of the property stated ""right next to beach"" .........WRONG!  The property was in a grotty end of town up a mosquito infested tin pan alley no where near the beach, infact over half a mile away. If you like noisy mopeds, drunken yobs and kebab shops then this was the neighbourhood for you.  The actual apartment, well all I can say is the the cleaning product smell did a poor job of covering up the damp that is evident on most walls.  Inadequate kitchen if you wish to eat anything other than a pot noodle as well as dirty (clumps of greasy hair on floor) from whom or where I do not wish to think about.The second bedroom had bunk beds (I stopped sleeping in bunk beds when I was 12) but a cosy night was to be had with no working fan or aircon under the 15 tog duvets provided, either that or open the window and get eaten alive my the mozzies. As for the on street parking facilities mentioned totally unless you have hired a bike or skateboard, forget it! Thouroughly dissapointed at the state of the appartment and the attitude of the owners and booking.com when requesting a refund which they refused.  I litterally stayed at the property a whole 20minutes with my family whilst booking alternative accomodation elsewhere and then left.  The property put in a ""no show"" stating I didnt turn up despite me informing booking.com immediately the property was totally unsuitable prior to leaving, this allowed the property to readvertise during my original booking.  Over 10 days later Im still going back and forth with booking.com trying to recoup monies with no success,  I get a different customer service agent every time correspondance comes through and I have to go back to the begining and explain everything again which is incredibly frustrating. Booking.com have stated it is not their responsibility to refund me and the property owner is not interested.Complete dissapointment and dissatisfaction. I dont feel valued as a customer at all.        "	                7	1	Monday	booking	negative

822	            I have booked 7 or 8 times thru booking.com.  I get the impression you can say anything in your listing and they could care less.  Went to Vienna.  The apartment was in the middle of town but when we got there it was across the river, a 45 minute ride by bus and train.  I always look for a place with parking.  Many say they have parking but when you get there, they don't actually have parking, it's fend for yourself in town somewhere, the thing I'm trying to avoid.  Had to cancel due to family member getting sick.  Booking.com says one thing and the apartment owner says something different about cancellation.  I'm really going to try and find something else to book rooms but I'm sure it will be allot more work but hopefully will pay off in the long run.        	                1	2	Sunday	booking	neutral

I cancelled and went to another website and booked the same rooms in the same hotel cheaper than Bookings.com's original quote.The second time I booked and paid for a two night stay in the Dales. With bags packed on the morning I was due to leave for the hotel and email came through from bookings.com to say the rooms were cancelled as the hotel had closed. I called the hotel direct to find that it had not closed and did not have a contract with bookings.com. My weekend was ruined as all hotels in that area were now fully booked.

829	            Very honest review!!! This is a horrible, unpleasant site to book your hotel reservation!!! I need to call them back and forth just to get the booking than. Booking was confirmed in their system but when I went to holiday inn it wasn’t in their system. I reserved double bed at booking.com site but because the booking was not in the property system so they have manually do it. I ended up having a twin bed which I really hate!!! Not really good value for your money especially when you don’t get the right product and service you pay for!

They are much more expensive than hotels.com, their customer service is terrible and they don't honor their policy of refunding the difference if you find the same hotel/room at a cheaper rate.  I made the mistake of booking a hotel with booking.com in London and a few days later found it for $50 less on hotels.com and 20+ emails and 3 phone calls later, they refuse to honor their policy of price matching/refunding difference.  I kept sending them files in .pdf,.jpg,.png format and they said they couldn't open the files.  Then I asked them to cancel the reservation so I could just make the reservation through hotels.com and they refused and said if I cancelled, I would get charged the full amount.  I booked it over a month before my arrival and they still refused to cancel and refund my money so I'm stuck paying the higher rate.        	                3	1	Friday	booking	negative

They claimed to have tried phoning me - LIE as no missed calls or messages. They said it was due to technical difficulties with payments from my Credit Card. I paid for the booking IN FULL on February 4th so this was another LIE.I phoned their customer services and after a long wait spoke with Rico. He said that the Hotel was closed so everyone was being cancelled. Another LIE. While he went to sort out my refund, my wife phoned Iberostar who confirmed the Hotel was open and put her through to the Hotel. They confirmed availability and said that Booking.Com had difficulties paying them so had cancelled all their bookings.  She also advised using Expedia as they had no payment difficulties with them. We then booked the same room for the same dates.You need to be much better at LYING if you are going to do this. Its too easy to catch you out.I will never use Booking.Com again and am cancelling my account.

There is no discretion with such a horrible accommodation that lies about the nature of it's listing...but that's the whole point of the exercise: neither the accommodation or booking.com actually care about their customers' experience.... I truly hope that booking.com goes bankrupt...they are bottom feeders of the highest order. And don't even get me started on their rude, passive aggressive customer service agents who sound like they do not even want to be at work...an absolute joke of a company.

And when you then turn up to be surprised to find that you have to SHARE a toilet at a Hostel at a rate of €74 per night despite pictures that appear to show a lovely normal room......When I immediately CANCELLED (only 20 minutes after making the actual booking on the website), Booking.com still charged me a FULL nights charge - for nothing. Unfair practice possibly illegal, and I will brief the Finnish consumer ombudsman and the Advertising standards about this, so action can be taken.When trying to contact Booking.com there is NO understanding whatsoever.......so complete waste of time and money.

After 10 days, they send us an email and said that there was a mistake about the prices and hotel gave wrong prices to them. Therefore , they asked us to accept new prices which were approximately 10 times what we had paid. When we did not accept and said it was not our mistake but yours and hotels as well , they cancelled our reservation without our permission. We made whole of our plan according to this reservation and according to this prices we bought our flight tickets, we paid other hostels that we will stay before going to Berlin etc. How can it be possible that we are punished as a result of hotel and booking.com’s mistake ? I hope that they will solve our problem and fix their shame as soon as possible. We cannot understand that they call it as a mistake and just cancel it , it is not that easy. What about us ? What am I gonna suppose to do ? I have flight tickets , I arranged all my budget accordingly.

852	            This company is a joke! I am renting my home out and they charge you double the fee of any other similar sites. This would not be a problem, however when it comes to how I am protected against bad guests (damages to my property, etc.), they say they do not deal with that, and if I have any problem, I should go to the authorities. So, no guest protection whatsoever. Similarly, after setting the prices up, and when guests book the property, they pay only a portion of the booking fee, and the remaining payment should be made by the guests during their stay in cash. This is a joke. Also, it takes almost two months to pay you for each reservation (if they pay at all), which is just the most ridiculous thing. Finally, when you have to modify the booking because your property got damaged, they charge you hundreds of  pounds as a penalty. The communication with them is a nightmare, as either they do not respond at all, or respond back with a totally unrelated automated message. And this is the case even when there is a very urgent case. i have similar issues as a guest (non-paid referral fee, no response to my emails, etc.)I don't even know how a company like this still exist!

855	"            I booked an apartment for 6 of us for my birthday through booking.com. The check in wasn't until 5 pm, before check in I called the owner to where I could receive the key to the apartment, during this conversation I advised the booking was for my birthday and that there were 6 of us girls, ages of 20 - 21. We were just using it as somewhere to sleep and to get ready as we were going into the city center for celebrations. At 11pm we were sat round the table having a few drinks with the taxi arriving at 11.30 we also had a portable speaker on in the background. At around 11 the owner of the apartment barged in without announcement, not even knocking before entry, violating our personal space and also startling us. He came in shouting demanding to see our driving licenses as we were drinking (bare in mind you have to have a license to see this). We handed over our licenses anyway as we felt so intimidated. He further demands us to leave immediately even though a this point a taxi was waiting outside. He accused us of having a party? A party of 6???? With a taxi waiting outside???? It's not exactly a prime location for a party. He then pushed my friend out the door even though she was just waiting for my friend to get her belongings. As we were leaving he continues to carry this creepy persona by calling us all ""very pretty"" we all felt violated and harassed. This ruined my birthday completely, we then had to sleep in our cars that evening which is very irresponsible of the owner, we felt unsafe and were worried that he would actually come after us. Booking have not been able to help with this at all. I actually had to chase them myself a number of occasions to make a complaint, I then received an email from booking a week after complaining advising there was nothing they could do.

Contacted booking.com they admitted the money should not of been taken however Now requested back statements to show this transaction in order to “start negotiations with the hotel for a refund” why negotiate? Ye took my money without my autorisation! This issue took me 3 weeks to resolve I sent booking.com my statement never heard a word back. In the end I contacted the hotel who did refund me but left me 12 euro short. I contacted booking.com about this and again was asked for statements. Not worth the hassle for 12 euro.Plenty other hotel booking sites out there I had 2 more hotels booked with booking which I cancelled and will never use this company again        	                13	1	Monday	booking	neutral
863	            We booked an apartment through booking.com at the Colony Club Lanzarote.  When we arrived the owner meet us to show us into the apartment as soon as we walked into the complex we discover the pool was empty and having maintenance.  We was told there was no pool facilities when we book.  The owner said she didn't think it would have been a problem and we could swim in the sea.  I explain that we wanted a pool.  She rang next door to the apartments who had a vacancy we apoke with booking.com who advised they would cancel her booking and reimburse the refund back to me.  I paid the new apartments which cos another £180 pounds more which I was extremely annoyed about but we are put in a position of not really having a choice but to.pay the difference.  Since I have returned I have contact booking.com who said I need to deal direct with the owner to try and claim the difference back from her and booking.com are not responsible.  They are acting as an agent for this customer and they should have some legal obligation to the customer.

Due to the French rail strike we had to change our plans regards our one night in Paris. As it happened, this was the only hotel of the 10 where the booking was 'non-refundable'. After sending one email to Booking.com they promptly contacted the hotel to ask about a refund and a couple of days later the money was back in my account.

We had to phone customer services to get a refund who then informed us they could not refund over £20 and a manager would need to authorize the refund. Days later we got a refund for an amount that was not what we paid due to the exchange rate changing. We lost £24 because of booking.com's inability to automatically cancel and refund bookings. Their customer service team are not helpful at all. Won't be using booking.com again.        	                3	1	Sunday	booking	negative

867	"            Don't ever book with these amateurs. I booked a hotel, was severely delayed en route and requested a late check in. I travel a lot for work and hotels will ALWAYS make allowances and accommodate the needs of their guests. Instead I arrived at 1am to find the hotel completely shut, no means of entering. I was left totally stranded. When I complained to booking.com I was told ""unless the late check in is conformed and not honoured we cannot request a refund"". So basically they don't pass on the request, it is never confirmed and they are under no obligation to refund or help in any way. Convenient. So I had nowhere to stay through no fault of my own, and will pay for the pleasure. I wonder would they be so happy with this response if I were a lone woman left stranded on the street for a night?

I now have to pay 50 euros on something that I earned nothing on to add to the extortionate commissions they charge. Shame on you booking.com.

Input card details to Booking’s website without the CVV security number as instructed and was told no money would be taken from my card!  I subsequently found the same hotel cheaper on the hotels own site so cancelled the booking almost immediately.  WOW! Imagine my surprise when I found they have debited just over £1300 from my credit card!  Whilst they emailed to say they were refunding my money, it would take 7-12 days to do so  so I get caught with interest charges!.Tried calling Booking.com twice and got cut off.  Emailed through the system and got a stock response and requested a call back TWICE!  No response.  According to my credit card company, Booking.com is notorious for debiting cards without CVV number.  I have never paid for a hotel through the website, always paid on arrival so they shouldn’t have CVV number recorded anywhere at all.  Nightmare        	                3	1	Thursday	booking	positive

885	            Almost a year ago I booked a hotel through booking.com. I booked well in advance as I knew it would be a busy bank holiday weekend and Michael McIntyre was on stage at the arena (this was the reason for our trip).So, after being excited for 355 days to go and see Michael McIntyre the day finally arrived! We got to our hotel and went to check in. The hotel had no record of our booking. I booked through booking.com and had the app open on my phone showing my booking, the booking reference, what rooms I had booked etc. I also had the original email stored in my phone showing the booking was confirmed. Obviously this caused huge amounts of stress. En route to the hotel we had witnessed how busy the town was. A glorious bank holiday weekend, stags and hens filled the streets. Michael McIntyre was on at the arena. I started trawling the internet looking for another available hotel. Myself and my partner were very anxious by this point as we had travelled by train and taxi and it was now looking like we would either have to travel home and miss the show or sleep rough on the streets!The hotel manager was amazing. He really came to our rescue. He rang around several hotels searching for somewhere for us to stay. His searching paid off. Somewhere would accept us! It was double the price of my original booking but we were just glad to have a bed for the night. We accepted the rooms. (I say rooms because I had booked for us and friends, both rooms were not recorded as being booked at the hotel).The hotel manager paid for an Uber to take us to the new hotel. I had to pay upfront for both rooms and take my receipt back to the original hotel the next day and the manager reimbursed the difference. He was so helpful.Booking.com however is not contactable on weekends! I emailed them requesting to be contacted and the manager of the original hotel has tried to contact booking.com. I will be very dubious of using booking.com again and if I ever did then I would definitely be contacting the hotel to ensure the booking was received.What was supposed to be a relaxing night with friends started off with so much stress that it was hard to enjoy the weekend. So many 'what ifs' constantly running through my head. It caused a lot of upset.I cannot thank the original manager enough for his compassion and patience. His help was very much appreciated and I hope he will be reimbursed for the costs incurred to him and the business.Booking.com... Perhaps I will try a different site next time. I would definitely NOT recommend!        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	positive

My wife called whilst I was on the phone and got through straight away. The first rep said to fill in a compIaints form and get £20 refund off the hotel. It’s not the hotels fault as booking.con misrepresented them.l was eventually put through to a so called supervisor who had a disgraceful telephone manner and was extremely unhelpful.

892	            I just recently booked three hotels at booking.com for a trip through China. I received an email on April 29th, which I did not open until May 2nd, that the hotel in Shanghai where we were going to stay at on May 3rd had a facilities malfunction and the entire Hotel was going to be closed. I'm leaving the country in 16 hours and panicking. It is the Labor Day holiday in China and the original hotel was already very hard to find and book, especially since I'm traveling with my family and I need accommodations for four people.  I called booking.com, spoke to Carmen, she verified my phone number, and called me back 25 minutes later with an alternate accommodation choice. She recommended that I book quickly because it was the last one available. She also stated that this reservation was going to be more expensive than our original reservation but that booking.com would reimburse me for the difference. In 30 minutes I went from panic to essentially a free upgrade. They have since then emailed me apologizing for the inconvenience, reassuring me that they have cancelled my initial reservation without any fees, and that they will reimburse me for the extra expenses at this new hotel. I could not be any more pleased. They went above and beyond what I could have asked for.        	                1	5	Wednesday	booking	positive

It was confirmed they had received my email and after 15 minutes on the phone to them, they confirmed my booking in the other hotel. I was a little concerned I hadn't got a confirmation but had other things on my mind so never chased it up. On my partner trying to check into the hotel whilst I was racing, it was discovered I had no booking at all, resulting in a long drive home that evening after a very long day!!

900	"            While bookings may be convenient through such sites as Booking.com, any recourse isn't. Following a recent issue with a hotel, Bookimng.com had no interest whatsoever in sorting it out. Once they have processed your ""order"" do not expect any level of customer service. If you do manage to get through to them (extremely long wait times), they make little or no attempt to resolve any issues or even record deatils of the matter. You just get the standard ""nothing we can do on this occasion"" reply. Lesson learnt: book directly with the supplier, Booking.com does not make money helping to resolve issues and they don't.        "	                4	1	Tuesday	booking	neutral

Then my reservation was cancelled as no payment was made so I contacted booking.com who told me I needed to pay 50% deposit before going to which i said wasn’t fair as it said pay at property. They insisted I pay it while they investigated the case, baring in mind that I had proof that I didn’t have to pay at property. I was informed they will get back to me, they did not. So a week later I  contact them and ask to speak to a manger, the customer service representative refused to allow me to speak to a manger for 20mins and then I demeanded to speak to someone and so she forwarded it. I was told because it said in the small print I had to pay the full amount (which was mews to me!) I needed to make a payment! Im sorry but if a toy said 100% safe and the small print said 50% chance of death companies would not get away with it so why should they?        	                2	1	Tuesday	booking	neutral
902	            As I arrived at Brussels Midi on the Eurostar I received an e-mail stating that my reservation had been cancelled. I was offered an alternative hotel and told that this hotel was 10km away and that the cost of additional transportation would be met. Given that I already knew that Brussels was very busy, I accepted the alternative accommodation for myself and my 4 colleagues. At this point it turned out that the accommodation was 55km away, that the restaurant would be closed by the time I got there and that the alternative hotel was so remote that it would be impossible to get another meal that evening.The alternative hotel was actually quite pleasant, but what was very unpleasant was that it turned out that reimbursing the cost of additional transport was in fact a lie.

904	            I used to love booking.com, but in the past year I've noticed a strange thing: they don't show you bad reviews, only the good and average ones. Even if the property has a low score, you will still see only positive reviews. 2 weeks ago I stayed at the hotel in Moscow I wasn't happy about and I left an honest review, around 5.5 points. To my surprise when looking at this hotel today I've noticed that my review wasn't visible, only reviews with a score of 7.5 and higher were showing. Quite interesting... Misleading customers is not a good move, booking.com, think twice..        	                4	1	Sunday	booking	positive
905	            We canceled our reservation number 2037924116 with Booking.com for a stay at The Coral Atlantis, Nassau, on February 14th. The original booking was made on the basis of having a free cancellation policy. Despite  contacting Booking.com and the hotel direct on numerous occasions, we are still waiting for our deposit to be repaid to us months later. We have received nothing but misleading or false information from The Coral at Atlantis and are  disappointed that Book.com have not been more proactive in providing appropriate support. We have had to repeatedly state our case to Booking.com and have had to provide them with the same information over and over. Yet Booking.com have not even had the curtesy to return our many customer service phone calls as promised.        	                1	1	Sunday	booking	positive

908	            Why NOT to book thru Booking.comBooking.com sends us a guest booked for one night, one person for a dormitory bed. He arrives and he is with his 70 yr old mother. He says it’s ok because his mother sleeps with him in the same bed in the dorm. We say that is not possible and we go out of our way to give them both 2 beds in a private room in our staff house. Later a guest comes to us and tells us this guy follwed him to the bathroom and propositioned him from outside the door. We reprimand the guest. Still later another guy comes and tells us the same thing happened to him. We ask him to leave and tell him his mother can stay and that we have children staying here and we show him our child protection policy prominently displayed at our front desk. He leaves and goes to Alona village. He is brought back by the police at 4 a.m and proceeds to yell and scream and smash things, waking everyone (40 people including his mother and the children that are here) and it takes us an hour to calm him down and get his mother to take him off the property by about 5:30 a.m ...by which time other guests are ready to fight to get rid of him. As he leaves yelling and screaming he threatens to give us a 0 review score on Booking.com. We say no problem go ahead just please leave so everyone can go back to sleep. By this time we had already phoned the police again and his mother dragged him away before they came. Sure enough about 3 hours later we get a review on Booking.com and it wasn’t zero but was 2.5...the lowest review score allowed on their system. We wrote to Booking.com explaining the whole situation and they took down the comments in the review but left the score and so it affected our overall rating. This made the whole situation even worse. Booking.com was allowing this psycho to damage our reputation by allowing the review score to remain but removing the comments by which any average person reading them would have known this guy had a problem. We have asked Booking.com to remove this review in its totality, score included and they STILL refuse...this is after the above explanation to them 8 different times or more. Our position now is that Booking.com is complicit in damaging our reputation and we no longer accept any bookings with this company. We will be seeking damages accordingly and we encourage everyone in the hospitality business to be wary of the “so called Partner Support” you will recieve from Booking.com.Andy WheatleyLennon’s Place Backpacker HostelPanglao, BoholPhilippines        	                1	1	Friday	booking	negative

911	            This company is a total disgrace. I arrived at a hotel booked through them and could not stay in my booked room because of the filthy condition of it.My money was taken as soon as I arrived and then refunded when I left. Booking.com will NOT publish my review because I did not stay there. This is not my fault and others are entitled to see my review before they book. My review on The Amsterdam Hotel, Brighton is as follows:-Was due to stay in a boutique double room with balcony sea view to celebrate my wedding anniversary. After driving around Brighton for 40 minutes to find a parking space we walked a long way with our bags to get there. We were charged the full amount before even stepped into the room. When we arrived in the room my wife and I were disgusted in what we experienced. Over powering stench of strong bleach met us as we entered the room. The worst part was the bedding. The sheets were filthy with a large brown/red and yellow stains on them and also on the mattress. When we complained the man in reception he could not care less. We showed him the photo of the sheet and he told us he would just turn the mattress over!! We were then shown two other basic rooms and to our disgust the bedding was also filthy with one having a hole in the sheets. It was so unpleasant we decided that we were not comfortable in staying at this hotel and it put a real downer on our weekend after travelling over a 100 miles to get there. The staff told us that many drug addicts have been housed here paid for by the council and they have left the rooms in a terrible state and are having a ‘nightmare’. Price for this room was £154. Stay well away.        	                15	1	Wednesday	booking	negative
912	            Absolutely shocking!!! They charged us almost double the rate for a bed and breakfast than the hotel we stayed at would charged for an all inclusive package!!! When we complained, we received no response or anything!!! HORRIBLE!        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	negative
913	            I Have booked in Modern's Hotel , Paris though Booking.com  , reservation number 1782134347 PIN 9279  in 12 March 2018. The FULL price of my stay was immediately charged to my credit card and I received a confirmation and e-mail: ” Payment received thank you for your quick response.Best regards, Reception team” .On 2 April I was shocked to receive a message from Booking.com:“We can confirm that your reservation at Modern's Hotel has been cancelled. You don’t need to take further action, but if you have any queries for the property, their contact details are: +33 1 43 43 41 17.”I called Booking.com and Modern Hotel… Conclusion” Yes, a mistake was made but they would not change the online status of my booking which remained” CANCELLED” and they would not send me another confirmation. I just had go by the verbal reassurance. Given that I had prepaid the full price I had no choice but to stay in this hotel. I could not add my review for this hotel to my previous reviews in my Booking.com page because it was considered as “cancelled “although I did stay in the hotel.I really wonder how was this property licensed by the authorities in France as an “hotel” . It seems that anything could be listed by Booking.com .I stayed in the 4th floor with no lift but only a spiral stairway with 67 steps and shaky rails. Climbing to the room is a daily risk and ordeal if you carrying baggage . THERE WAS  NO TELEPHONE IN THE ROOM.The bathroom had a bad smell all the time, with uncomfortable fittings. All ceiling lamps were not working and when I complained they sent a worker who bent the reading lights to the ceiling to light the room, without replacing the ceiling lamps. The TV had only French channels and the staff barely understood English. Overall it is a dirty and poorly managed.  Its only advantage is location but there are many other hotels in the same street. Even if Modern’s hotel offers the lowest price I you would recommend that you pay a little more and book in a more appropriate hotel in the area. I think my feedback on this hotel is important for others who might make reservations in this hotel through Booking.com site. However , Booking.com regarded my reservation as cancelled and would not take my review on the hotel.        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	negative
914	            Today booking.com lost a loyal customer.I booked a hotel in Venice through booking.com for mine and my husbands first wedding anniversary many months ago. This morning I had an email stating my booking had been cancelled, much to my surprise!I firstly called the hotel to see if this was the case and tried to re book once they stated it had been cancelled. They had already sold our room. I then called Booking.com to see if they could amend their error to no avail!Over and over again I was told an email had been sent 2 days before warning me that my card was not valid. I did not receive any warning email nor is there any reason that my card would 'not be valid' there were sufficient funds and it is years off expiring. The customer service representative simply played the blame game and, to be honest, his responses were simply embarrassing! After many calls and emails back and forth Booking.com are not willing to help me in any at shape or form to get my anniversary break back on track.Now, 1 month before our trip, I have paid above the odds for a new, not as nice hotel (due to bank holiday rates/last minute booking) AND my husband has found out about the trip.I am genuinely shocked at the terrible customer service received. I have been a loyal customer in the past and will never be booking with Booking.com again.        	                2	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

916	"            Made a reservation through booking.com. 2 rooms for 3 nights. Found out just before going that the the hotel had an offer 3 nights for the price of 2. This offer had been on for some time. The hotel could not honour the deal due to Booking.com charges to them, and I could not cancel as I would have lost the deposit. Booking.com will not honour their own ""Best Price Guarantee"" so it has left me £200.00 out of pocket. I suggest all users check direct with hotels to ensure they are being offered the lowest price. The ""best price"" offered by Booking.com is not always what it seems        "	                6	1	Tuesday	booking	neutral

918	            Absymal. Booked the Demais apartments, Menorca, through booking.com  in October 2017. Because Monarch airlines went bust, neither the hotel nor booking.com would allow us to cancel our booking. Fair enough! so we elected to pay the difference and move the booking to  May 2018, no problem! but, the hotel took the entire payment a second time from our credit card. When we attempted to contact the hotel, it was nigh on impossible to get through to them!!!!! Booking.com were in the main, unresponsive and difficult to contact, but would insist that we contact the hotel.(Ho Hum!) Finally they insisted that our credit card had expired(which it hadn`t?) but we should forward them all bank/credit card statements, to prove overpayment, which we did!!!! but are still awaiting the repayment of over £400 for which Bookig.com took from our account without authorisation!        	                1	1	Monday	booking	neutral

I book an hotel that was free of charge until the 26 of june and the property has already taken from my bank account 1000 €. Booking is not providing support and they also decline their responsability as they mentionned that it should be manage directly with the property.They should at least garantee what is stated on their website. and should act as a facilitator in case of issue.Here it is not the case - they are just taking you for idiot.what a great behavior - congrats!        	                2	1	Monday	booking	positive

I’ve had 3 phones calls to the customer service team which have kept insisting it will be back within the next few days, each time it hasn’t gone back in. Off the phone to them today for them to tell me yet again that it will be back in the next week. Absolute scam, it’s disgusting how they can hold your money for so long.

921	            I’m not using Booking.com again now after booking what should have been a treat which turned into a misery.Booked to go to the Grand Arenzano through Booking.com for a special family occasion.  The hotel was expensive but it advertised a spa so I booked it on this basis.  After a few weeks of emailing the hotel to ask how I booked the spa, they eventually admitted the spa was shut for refurbishment.  Booking.com apparently had no idea of this and as the weeks went past, it transpired that even the hotel itself had no idea if or when the spa would re-open.This affects 200+ other bookings apparently, so if you’ve booked a stay there and are expecting a spa (expensive booking for a hotel without one!). I doubt Booking.com will let you know.Booking.com have been great on the phone but nothing gets resolved or progressed.  Their site did advise me, however, that prices were going up at this destination, reassuring me that I’d probably be paying more now to stay elsewhere if I cancelled this booking as my departure date nears!The Hotel very kindly agreed to cancel my booking without fees.  Thanks for nothing.The hotel takes a month to process the refund.  Booking.com take a week but need documentary proof of payment.  I’ve already waited a week to get to this point and lost count of the phone calls I’ve made to sort this out.In short, things happen but it’s what you do about them that counts and in this case it was nothing!        	                1	1	Monday	booking	positive

Promised refund as I refused to stay in a dangerous apartment. 7 weeks on, 9 emails and still no sign of the refund! Be aware if you book private apartment with them. If something goes wrong- you're on your own! Customer service is shocking, every time when in contact I have to explain my issue again and again.

I was advised someone would come with a key the next day, no one turned up. After speaking to booking.com they tried to move us to an apartment 24km away when in fact we had booked and paid for a bed detached villa.

Se per esempio spunti e togli la disponibilita' di un letto extra, la modifica ci puo' mettere una settimana per andare online o deve essere approvata dal sito per cui, nel frattempo, rischi di ricevere prenotazioni per una persona in piu che poi devi gestire da solo col cliente perche' l assistenza dopo piu di 48 ore ancora non ha risposto.Quest anno hanno messo online la possibilita' di spuntare e offrire vari servizi extra come Netflix e il WiFi portatile, ma per un limite del sito, nato a suo tempo per camere d hotel, i servizi non sono visibili all'ospite dell appartamento.Inoltre non puoi scegliere tu il testo dell annuncio ma e' il sistema automatico che lo decide, prendendo dati dai servizi spuntati o dalle distanze inserite.Per quanto riguarda il titolo poi, pensateci su bene prima di inserire l'annuncio poiche' e' impossibile cambiarlo dopo; praticamente come la descrizione.Rispetto ad altri siti moderni, i loro sito e' davvero poco flessibile.E' poi praticamente impossibile parlare con il call centre italiano in caso di bisogno.

If, for example, you tag and remove the availability of an extra bed, the change can take a week to go online or must be approved by the site, in the meantime, you risk receiving bookings for an extra person that you have to manage alone with the customer because the assistance after more than 48 hours has not yet responded.This year they have put online the possibility to check out and offer various extra services like Netflix and portable WiFi, but for a site limit, born in its time for hotel rooms, the services are not visible to the guest of the apartment.Also you can not choose the description of the advert but it is the automatic system that decides it, taking data from the services checked or the distances entered.As for the title then, think about it well before inserting the advert as it is impossible to change it later; practically like the description.Compared to other modern sites, their site is very flexible.It is then practically impossible to speak with the Italian call center in case of need.

937	"            I had used Booking.com for many years without having an issue, but my most recent experience made me never use them again. I was in Indonesia booking a hotel via their app and the internet connection was low, so I had a few connection error messages until finally my reservation gotten through. I then went on a Live Aboard in Raja Ampat, without internet connection until I got to the hotel. It's only then I found out that I got two booking confirmations and the hotel first insisted in me paying both but then agreed to have me pay just one room, as it was only me and clearly not my fault. This was the Fave Hotel in Sorong. I contacted booking.com right away via e-mail and they responded telling me they are messaging the hotel and I been told things should be fine. The hotel then went on to take money from me after I had left, without me authorizing the payment. Booking.com did only sent automated e-mails as an answer to my attempt to solve this until I finally got to call them, both people I spoke to, in Indonesia and home in England where friendly and helpful, but their e-mail customer service whom I was limited to during my travels is an absolute nightmare. I finally was offered 21 pounds from the 38 pounds double charge, which I at this point accepted as I been trying to get help for 2 weeks at that point. Basically I paid for the room I stayed in and 17 pounds for another room I never used and hadn't blocked as I only received one confirmation in my app. The transfer went quick. My advise is, if you have the option, go via hotels.com or Airbnb. Booking.com was always my ""Go To"" but this experience really showed how they do not care and will not refund you for their own glitches in their system. If you have to use booking.com make sure you call them when you have an issue as you can not reach them anywhere else.        "	                2	2	Tuesday	booking	positive

940	            They tell you the hotel is 5 miles away when in reality its in outer Mongolia. Also when trying to book as a business you can only reserve a room with the business card and then when your staff turn up and they haven't got a business card they have to jump through hoops to pay as the card is absent but will happily charge the card in your absence if you don't turn up. My advice is, use booking.com to find the hotel then google it, phone them direct and ask them to match booking.com price. works every time.        	                1	1	Monday	booking	positive

We called booking.com and they said we booked it wrong (calling the customers a liar basically) and we were made to pay an addition £2000 for the extra people. The hotel advised that was the SECOND time that week booking.com made an error of the amount of people on a booking and so they believed we did not book wrong and it was in fact booking.com's error.        	                5	1	Monday	booking	negative

Sent a message through the booking app months ago to see if I could add an extra night, still no response.Went on line 4 days ago to add the missing night and by chance happened to look at the updated reviews of this location.I was appalled to see photos of bed bug bites, mold on window casings, holes in dry wall and stories of rooms being booked by the half hour by Ladies of the night.I emailed customer service to request some help the same day, NO RESPONSE IN 4 DAYS.I am seriously considering contacting the other properties booked directly to see if I can cut booking.com out for all my other bookings.Now probably 3 weeks since my attempt to contact booking.com and the hotel still no reply.I have booked alternate hotel and will eat the 250.00 dollars.Larry        	                1	1	Sunday	booking	negative
944	"            I booked a flat in Lisbon through this outfit. When I got there, the flat was in the middle of a construction site, rainwater penetrates the front bedroom and a smell of damp permeates the flat due to shower tray not being fitted correctly, and failing to empty water. I paid over £100 per night for such a place.Google ""Thx feelslikehome.pt and booking.com"" for videos.I complained to feelslikehome.pt (who managed the flat). They offered a max 40 Euros compensation, that I refused. I filed a legal complaint with them.I complained to Lisbon tourist board and filed a legal complaintI complained to Lisbon tourist police as it was evident that the managers were well aware of the condition and were intent on continuing to rent it to the next person.I complained to booking.comAll of these parties, I complained to whilst on holiday and included photos and videos.Booking.com refused to pay me any compensation, saying that I had not complained whilst on holiday. When I pointed out that a dedicated email address had been set up with them half way through the holiday to deal with my complaint, they simply went silent. The apartment is still being advertised here despite them being fully aware of the condition that the flat is in.

We discovered that one of the bed sheets appeared to be full of stains, and booking.com caused the hotel to refund the first night. Initially, the hotel told us to get lost when we asked for new sheets and partial refund of first night.

948	            Booking.com offer a 'Price Match Guarantee' on their website, and all their emails.  I happened to find the same hotel with the same room and same everything else available 10% cheaper with Hotel Tonight.Because Hotel Tonight is a mobile app and not a website and therefore I couldn't 'send a link to the cheaper site' despite sending a screen shot, Booking.com wouldn't honour the price match.This is irritating not because of the money - it wasn't a fortune - but because by including a 'Price Match Guarantee' claim in the emails and website signage, booking.com lull a person into the security that their prices must be the best.  They evidently are not.The fact that they then renege on this promise means it doesn't cost them any cash.  It does - me being a case in point - cost them customers though. I implore you:  Try Hotel Tonight (or anyone) before booking.com.        	                1	1	Friday	booking	positive

951	"            First of all, I have been working with this compsny since 2010, I run a few properties, paid my 18% commission invoices in time. I was loyal. This February my contract was terminated, because they claim that I, being the owner of the property, wrote something discriminative towards certain guest. Well, when I asked to whom and how I was discriminative they did not give any reply.... I have no clue what have I done wrong. Maybe, this is just an assumption, I have received around 100 fraud reservations from China, 100 from North Africa, there are others. People sometimes use booking.com to get reservation confitmation for visa purposes in Europe and booking.com does not mind. When I wrote to the 101th ""client"" whether he us coming or not, maybe I have not used my ""Sir or Madame"". I do not know. My rating was 9.1 last year, clients were happy, but...  Just for future partners, not only that they charge high commission on reservstions for they crappy unannoimous services, but they also rude, discrmininative, bullying company and acts as it pleases.

953	            Firstly I'd like to say that I never had an issue with booking.com before but I've never had to speak to their customer service before. Which has been a shockingly poor and lengthy experience. I booked a room and had to pay full price on the website before my stay. Then when I went to leave, the hotel charged me again because they did not have the money from booking.com. So when I checked my bank account I saw that I had indeed been charged twice. So I called Booking.com, who said they couldn't get hold the hotel, which I managed to do immediately after getting off the phone to them. I had to send proof that there was a double charge and they'd sort it. Nearly a week later, nothing. So called back and told that they still couldn't contact the hotel but if they still couldn't they would refund me the following day themselves. Of course, nothing. I waited an extra day to give them a chance and still nothing. So again I phone, and again I explain everything, then I was kindly put on hold for 15 minutes without any explanation. So I hung up and try again. This time I ask if I can speak to someone above, but they don't have this process because Seniors won't speak to you on the phone. So basically I'm told that whatever Customer Service promise or do, theirs nothing you can do about other than if you're lucky get a nice advisor. Which I eventually did. She told me that they had all the correct information and couldn't see why it wasn't refunded and now waiting for a Senior to authorize , fingers crossed. I don't know if its incompetence, poor service or they were hoping I'd go away, but it was an awful customer service experience.        	                3	1	Thursday	booking	neutral
954	            Yesterday 11th April 2018 we arrived at our 4star hotel in Chichester early and asked if we could park  our car in their carpark, no-issue so good start. We returned at 15:20 (checking in was 3pm) and to only discover we were double booked by Booking.com who took our money on 29th &amp; informed us on the day at 13:52 by a USA call and email. As we do not pick up unknown numbers and  international numbers we didn't pick up the phone nor did we see  the email. The irony we had 2 emails and 2 calls during the week asking if we wanted to book a sauna, message or spa by the hotel so we didn't imagine this will happen. We purposely booked a hotel in the centre of town so we could walk and have a drink without having to drive any where. We were offered a hotel but the location was in the middle of nowhere so we asked for our money back and besides the damage was done and we were feeling angry and unfairly treated. We took 2 days off unpaid so we could relax as we hadn't had a holiday for over 2 years!!!They sent an email to confirm in writing of the cancellation but not confirmed money will be returned. Then we got a call from an unknown number in London and this time we took the call, it was Booking.com only to say money will be returned within 12 days - we said  not good enough as they made the mistake not us. Why did Booking.com not inform me in advance and why was this not advised through the Booking.com app, which we will now delete and as we have no intentions ever to use them again as we no longer trust them? We are absolutely disgusted how we were treated by Booking.com as they have not given us any reason why we were not chosen to keep our room booked 2 weeks prior and why we have to wait so long for our money back. The Hotel manager was very apologetic, sympathetic and accommodating on the day.        	                2	1	Thursday	booking	neutral

Received a reply to say they had received our email but never heard back from them. All in all a very poor service from both the hotel and booking.com.

958	            The WORST customer service you will come across. In case of an issue, if they have to contact the Hotel, they will make you feel as if they are doing you a favour. The website claims they are not an agent but only a listing website - that is fine but it is their responsibility to resolve in case of any dispute.I am not a marketing agent of AirBnB but I have been booking apartments with them also since the past 2-3 years and if there is any dispute, they always step in and do their best. As also confirmed by my friends.Booking.com has been losing business to AirBnB and will continue to lose if this is the state of their customer service. No one replies to any emails and every time you call, a different person will respond. There is no concept of case handling.The WORST Customer Service. I have a foot issue and I have repeatedly requested Hotel Adria to make full refund as the hotel reviews say there are lot of steps. This was never mentioned in the hotel’s listing and I only came across the accessibility issue by chance in one of the reviews after booking. I have shared my medical certificates with Booking.com but I have not been receiving proper written confirmation from the hotel or booking.com with regards to step free access.The website has confirmed that the hotel says there is step free access but Booking.com is not willing to confirm on an email that they will relocate me free of charge if there is any issue with accessibility at the time of check in. The Hotel is also not sending an email confirming in written that there is step free access.In fact, what is more audacious is that one of the representatives at Booking.com just told me rudely that the city is very hilly and I should reconsider my plans of even visiting the city if I have a foot problem. How can he say such a thing???? It is my choice where I go and what I do, I can visit the city and just go and sit at a beach - who is he to suggest such a thing?The hotel has not emailed yet and Booking.com is washing their hands off the booking.

One at the beginning of my trip, one at the end. After a long flight, we had to search for a non existent address and then find our own accommodation (thank you taxi driver). We have promptly contacted Booking.com to request a refund and confirm the other accommodation. It took Booking.com a week to come back to us (with daily emails to them) and the result was we were told, that the second accommodation was CLOSED. They have given us alterative accommodation at a similar price, but miles away from where we wanted to be! Thanks, but no thanks.

I was called by Booking.com customer service and after having provided a lot of evidenceWAS VERY QUIET AT BOOKING.COM.They no longer respond to your e-mails and so I can whistle to my Euro 780.00 !!!I think it's a scandalous behavior from booking.com.Booking.com offers accommodations and good faith book you through this site and if it is wronggoes to Booking.com and the customer is the victim of it then it gets very quiet at Booking.com.Then I'm not even talking about the costs I've made (calls to the property abroad) I've been working for months now to get my money back but in vain. But this unreliable owner of the property can still safely rent rooms through Booking.com. Totally untouched by Booking.com.Here you will get rid of the pants anyway !!So now I have to hire an expensive lawyer to call Booking.com into account        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	neutral
976	            Don’t do it to yourself. Booked a hotel 2 months in advance and the only option was to pay 2 days before arriving. 2 weeks before I’m about to leave I get a message saying my card is invalid when they tried to validate it. Bearing in mind this was Easter Sunday. Tells me to contact my bank but obviously it’s closed due to the holiday. Tells me I have 24 hours or I loose my bookingTells me to try put my card details in which I do and it says “booking confirmed”. The next day I get an email saying my booked hotel has been cancelled due to validation. Even though the website said confirmed. Couldn’t contact the hotel they hardly speak English and didn’t reply to my email. After this I phone up booking com and they tell me find a new hotel it cannot be reinstated. A way to cause panicky giving me only 24 hour is on a public holiday 2 weeks before I leave        	                1	1	Monday	booking	neutral

They offer a money back scheme if you find the same property/ dates cheaper elsewhere, I found a recent booking HALF the price on a different website so notified booking.com with all the details/ link etc as policy and had no reply, I messaged again 6 or 7 times trying to get a response but was simply ignored. It wasn't a huge amount of money, but it was just being ignored which annoyed me the most as this ""money back scheme"" obviously does not exist. I would be wary about booking a more expensive property if the customer service is this poor. I also recently booked a free cancellation property, but the money was taken from my account immediately, when I queried this I got a very flippant unprofessional reply and my issue was not dealt with.

991	"            I recently discovered as I made a cash payment for a booking held on my debit card - the hotelier had on a print out from Booking.com all my personal details: name, address, full mobile number, full debit card number, and full three digit CVC code.  I wrote to Booking.com 16/03/18 to express concern - to date I have no reply - only a generic email my email had been received.I today called company: first person I spoke with ended call after 6 minutes without helping resolve complaint, second kept interrupting as I tried express my concerns.  I will not use the company again as I cannot be assured in a trade that has a high turnover of seasonal staff, my personal and banking details are secure - in addition my stressful experience of trying to contact Booking.com, and how I have been rudely spoken to, have compounded my distrust in the company.  When you make a booking, be aware you are exposing your personal and banking details to people you do not know.  I photographed the printouts with all my details on - if I can do that in an instant, then so can anyone who has access to paperwork.  I enquired of a few proprietors while on my travels - they all reported direct access to CVC codeupdate: reading other client reviews - I have used Booking.com numerous times before without problem - some rooms have not been as in photos - but generally I was happy with company until I realised data is not secure - Booking.com have today, since I called them, written: ""We would like to assure you that your credit card details were provided to the property through our secure cryptosystem"". I again stress hotelier had a paper printout of all my personal and banking details - anyone with a camera phone could make a copy in a flash.  I have been using Booking.com with understanding only Booking.com retained personal data.  I have concrete proof this is not the case.In addition, I stopped submitting reviews a while back when a hotelier lied in their reply to an honest review I had written. I contacted Booking.com at the time 02/17 - to date no reply - no support - meanwhile a spurious reply is left online by Booking.com against my good name.I had submitted my review to inform fellow travellers: on day of check out I was told by hotelier they only accepted cash - this caused an immediate problem as we had spent all our cash, expecting payment to be taken on debit card.  My review reported this, to which hotelier replied they had given me an option to pay on debit card - which was a blatant lieBooking.com has done nothing to look into the matterI am now confident reviews do not adequetly reflect customer experience, and agree with the many disappointed reviewers on Trust Pilot that Booking.com does not do enough to check the standard of properties it lists - nor does it sincerely value customers using its booking serviceTo speak with customer services I called UK customer service: 0203 564 6725 - the call centre was in Amsterdam - one of the support staff I spoke to excused their poor communication skills by stating their English was 'not good'.

I have booked dozens of hotels  through booking.com during my extensive travels all over Britain, Australia and New Zealand, and I have never once had a problem with them. I think some people forget that they are only an agent and advertising platform,  they are not responsible for the standard of the hotel when you get there. That's what the reviews are for, so you can see what the reality of the place is rather than the blurb. I always read reviews carefully before booking and I have never found a place radically different from what they have led me to believe. I also always contribute a review. My reservation about booking.com is the amount of money they take from hotels and how difficult they have made it for smaller hotels to survive without being on it. When I have found a place I like in a town I prefer to book with them directly on future visits, but to be honest, many hotels have such terrible websites that they don't make it easy!  Booking.com makes the whole process very slick and streamlined, that's its strength.        	                31	4	Sunday	booking	neutral

When speaking to two different agents, we were advised that the cancellation insurance was only good for 24 hours after the initial purchase. By Canadian Law, this cancellation was available for free as per Canadian Corporate and consumer affairs. What a scam. Anytime we’ve traveled, we have always bought trip insurance and shame on us, assumed that Booking.com would be conforming to insurance standards.Both agents were abrasive and uniformed. Both advised me that there is no recourse and I would have to go to Booking.com to read the fine print. I did and Lord knows could not locate said “fine print”.Additionally, we logged in and via IP address assumed that we were on the Canadian page. To our dismay, we were charges in US Dollars ever though my son had purchased the EXACT SAME FLIGHT and he was charged Canadian funds.

Out of our last five bookings, four have later cancelled leaving a large hole in our calendar and, more seriously, our bank account. Also, we can only take payment on arrival as Booking.com cannot, for some reason, offer us their credit card facility.

1015	            I am writing to complain about my recent experience with booking.com. I have been a customer for many years with booking.com and I have booked without any problems in the past, I have made over 17 bookings with booking.com in numerous destinations across the world. I recently booked with booking for 9/03/2018 until Monday the 12/03/2018 to stay for my birthday in bernidom, Spain with 5 friends (5  young ladies) As usual we booked a beautiful apartment as seen in the pictures. When we arrived we was greeted by the landlord. However, little did we know it would be a holiday from hell. In the evening the weather was very windy causing the apartment to be cold, the central heating did not work, we also noticed the hot water wasn’t working, the owner of the apartment visited the property and the issue was not resolved. I contacted booking.com i regards to the health and safety issues about 5am they said that due to the timing they would need to contact the property and get back to me later on during the day. We had to sleep in our winter jackets considering we paid 507 euros. I had to use the hair dye in order to keep warm and my friends had to stay by the gas cooker to keep warm. We hadn’t showered due to the temperature of the water. The next morning, with limited sleep due to the freezing conditions, the landlord came and temporarily fixed the hot water, this only lasted for 30mins after I had a shower the hot water and heating stopped working. None of my other friend where able to get a shower. This issue was reported again to the landlord,who started laughing and mocking us saying we should deal with it, saying things like its better to shower with cold water than be homeless’ at this time we was already frustrated and I began to cry. I contacted booking.com in order to get an alternative accommodation because the current living condition was not safe and due to my past medical history of getting ill, I was scared of getting serious ill whilst I was on holiday. Booking.com stated they wouldn’t do anything about the situation. Instead, we would need to pay for another accommodation ourself, I explained We didn’t not have additional funds to cover for any additional accommodation, they said they will refund my money and it would take 7-12 working days.  This didn’t make anysense, I asked why couldn’t the money be sent to an alternative accommodation they said no. We was very sacred, thinking we was actually stranded in another country. I asked to speak to the manager on numerous occasion I was turned down. I eventually got through to the supervisor who rudely said ‘ why would I go on holiday if I do not have Money’ I explained, we had a budget and it was a planned weekend, ticket and hotels booked. All we had was spending money to eat. No one budgeted to be stranded and looking for an alternative accommodation. The booking of the apartment was then cancelled without any notification, and booking.com started to send emails to me to vacate the current property without any accommodation sorted or provided. We was very vulnerable at this stage. We had to leave as the landlord threatened to call the police. We went on the streets and We was outside without any where to go, considering we are 5 young girls. We was helpless. One of my friends had her property stolen and we was outside for hours, without any where to go. We had to sleep on the side of the road. This all happened because booking.com failed to ensure there safety of there costumers and also failed to ensure the property they advertised on their app or website is for conducive living. I am currently undergoing counselling because of the traumatic experience I encountered with booking.com. I am deleting the app and have advice others to do so. This has been the worst experience of my life, thanks to booking.com.        	                4	1	Thursday	booking	negative
1016	"            This is the second time now that booking.com has disappointed me and my family, first time the showed us a house hotel and while booking we thought we where getting a room in the beautiful house in reading, when the confirmation email came through, we where not in the house but in an Annex no where near the house, the room looked nothing like the pictures shown, the bed was a pull out bed and the room was filthy, this time i booked with them and it stated very clearly on the website that they wouldn't take the payment until arrival, however after checking my account today, they had taken the money 3 WEEKS EARLY!!!! with cancellation fees added on top if I wanted to cancel!!! With the so called ""customer service team"" doing absolutely nothing to resolve this matter!! Don't waste your time or money booking with booking.com, they will rip you off and they probably just laugh at all the recorded calls.        "	                1	1	Thursday	booking	positive
1017	            My husband and I decided to have a treat on Valentine’s Day so we booked a suite at the Clayton Hotel in Birmingham city centre. The ‘deal’ clearly stated a suite ( it even had photos of the suite-which looked gorgeous! ) and breakfast for two in the morning. Apart from the fact that booking.com then decided to bombard our email with other deals ( at least 4 or 5 messages a day ), they took the money out of our account early. It clearly stated on the site that we’d pay on arrival. Red flags should’ve gone up then but we thought ‘ ok, one less thing to bother with when we get there’. So the day arrived and we turned up at the Clayton Hotel around 7pm. Firstly, there was nowhere to park our car. The tiny hotel car park was full, apparently, so the reception staff suggested that we park in Selfridges car park which is a good 20 minute walk away from the hotel. They were not friendly or helpful to be honest. After outright refusing to use that car park we were told that we could use a pre pay car park nearby but leaving our car there would be at our own risk. With no other choice we used it. We then learned that our room was not a suite but a standard room. And there was no breakfast either. We asked the receptionist to check on the computer as we’d had a deal through booking .com but were told they couldn’t do anything for us because we didn’t book directly with them. We were fuming by this point. We had no choice but to take the standard room. For the last slap in the face, our room looked directly over the tiny hotel car park and guess what? It wasn’t full. At all. There was plenty of room and another 10 cars could’ve fit in there easily. We are angry with both the Clayton Hotel and booking.com. Surely, as an upmarket Hotel, you should have some responsibility towards your guests whether they booked directly with you or not! Word of mouth counts for a lot and I’ll have nothing good to say about the Clayton if anyone asks in the future. As for booking.com, they put these deals on line, take your money and disappear when you try to contact them. I’ve been waiting for a response for over a month now. Amazing how fast they are to take your money though. The old saying is best here. If it looks too good to be true, it normally is. Don’t use booking.com. And don’t go to the Clayton Hotel in Birmingham!!        	                2	1	Thursday	booking	positive

1019	            Booked an apartment in October through booking.com to London as part of my daughters 16th birthday/Christmas present to go to walker stalker con on the 10th to 12th March and the hotel needed to be close  to the event as i have mobility problems, But on the 23rd of December over 2 months after booking it was mass cancelled (I was told that  apartment had closed) so i phoned up booking.com straight away as I had to find another hotel quickly as it had to be close to the event and we knew that the hotels would be quickly fully booked around the even area and as we where going to be given to my daughter on Christmas day it had to be done that day, so i booked another hotel which was £100 more than the original hotel so that was an extra £287 2 days before Christmas which was an extra expense i could have done without and as no refund was given yet as they had up to 14 day to refund anyway it was not refunded  so i called up Booking.com ''again'' and they said it would be another 14-28 days before booking.com would refund it, But Booking.com assured me the they would sort the refund out and also pay the difference between the 2 hotels, But they could not pay the difference until after we had stayed at the hotel so they told me to call them up on the 13th of March and they will refund the difference. Anyway we have since been to London had a great time (a few problems with the hotel but that's another review) anyway we come back and so I called up booking.com to get the refund of the difference between the 2 hotels that they assured me they would give, but i was told that they would not be giving out any refund for the difference between the hotels and on top of that the original hotel still have not refunded the original booking, So I have had to go through my Credit Card company who are dealing with it now.I would urge anyone who is thinking of using Booking.com to think twice about it and use another place that has better reviews. I will never use Booking.com again (closed my account with them) as they just don't seem to care what happens after you have booked anything through them' they fob you off with assurances and promise you that they will sort out any problems but they have just been one big disappointment. We had a great time in London but none of it was down to booking.com as any part of that trip that Booking.com had to do with was just a disaster and just caused so much grief.Booking.com are a terrible company to deal with so think twice about using them.        	                3	1	Thursday	booking	positive
1020	            I use this service quite often to book a place to stay when I travel, as it's really convenient for me. Sometimes I have other experience than users who write reviews, but we all know that everyone has different preferences. The user experience is not always the best, but in general, booking.com works good for me and I'm sure I'll use it for finding other destinations.        	                7	4	Thursday	booking	neutral
1021	            I booked a hire car with Booking.com. We had to wait 40 minutes to be picked up. Abusive agent at pickup. No details given of the damage to the car. I had to photograph the whole car which was a wreck. When I returned it the agent checked all my photos and said any damage not photographed will be charged. I tried to contact Economy bookings but they are in Latvia and didn't want to know anything once they had my money. Avoid at all costs.        	                9	2	Wednesday	booking	negative

1023	            I have been a satisfied customer of Booking.com up until my latest and very disappointing experience. In January 2018 my web browser crashed during the verification of my credit card when ordering a hotel reservation with advance payment. The payment was charged but no reservation code was issued. My complaint was not taken serious as I could not produce a reservations number, and quite a lot of money was lost. Now in March, 9 weeks later, another fee at around the same sum was charged from my credit card, with the transaction backdated to the same date in January. Again my complaint is not leading to any immediate refund as I cannot produce a reservation number. The electronic system seems to operate outside of control. Lesson learned: If you need to use Booking.com, do not accept advance payment by any means, and never use a debet card.        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	negative
1024	            I previously gave Booking.com a very poor review because I was having problems with my booking and although I had sent a few messages through electronically, no one was responding to my inquiry, I was so cross and at that time I had lost complete faith in the organisation. Then I half heartedly tried the customer service phone line and within minutes all my concerns and problems relating to the booking were on the way to being fixed after talking with one of the very switched on staff. I have since phoned three times and each time I get through quickly and to someone who can help me immediately. Top stars to the phone staff. The only reason I have held back on the stars this time is because when I booked I honestly though that I had the possibility of a full refund, free cancellation but once the money had gone through the message said I had paid in full and could not get a refund but this may well have been me pressing the buttons too hastily.        	                4	3	Tuesday	booking	neutral
1025	            If I could rate this company as zero then I would. I originally booked an apartment in Tenerife through them for 4 nights from 20th March as I was flying out to see my sister whom I had not heard from for some time. On the 6th March I heard the devastating news that my sister who was disabled and had moved out to Tenerife in search of a better life, had been found dead in her apartment. I contacted booking.com the next morning to see if the apartment had availability for me that night as I was flying out to identify my sister’s body and deal with all the bureaucracy etc. I was extremely distressed when I spoke to them and she; the owner of the original apartment offered me another apartment and sent me details which in reality looked nothing like described on booking.com They could not offer me anything else so I agreed to it. However on our arrival at 9pm that evening we found the apartment was not even in the same resort, had only two lights working and no WiFi, let alone a pool not that we would have used it. I told the agent who let us in the circumstances and said we need WiFi so we can contact the crematorium, courts etc. He said there was nothing he could do but said he would come back with lightbulbs the next day. The apartment was so dingy and depressing that we checked out at 8am the next morning and into a hotel in Los Christianos. We left a note for the owner explaining our reason but made the mistake of not informing booking.com. In hindsight we should have but we had to be at the court in Los christianos and had so much red tape to sort out, let alone deal with our own emotions. As soon as we got back to the uk I spoke to booking.com who said they would look into it. I received an email back saying as I had not contacted them at the time there is nothing they can do and the owner of the two properties would not refund. The one we were offered was half the price of the one first booked so they gained 200 euros at my expense. It is not the money, I can try to claim from my travel insurance but it is the lack of empathy and sympathy shown to me over the phone today by Mohammed A (he would not give me his full name).Please do not give this company your money.        	                2	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

1027	            I have used Booking.com for years now and been very satisfied with their service. However, in this most recent situation I cannot comprehend the way in which Booking.com have acted and how they have handled my request for assistance. Absolutely shocking!To celebrate my wife’s 40th birthday I booked a number of rooms at a resort in Turkey on behalf of our family and friends. This was done months in advance and confirmed immediately so we all went ahead and booked our flights.A couple of days ago and purely by chance I logged into Booking.com and discovered that our hotel reservations had been cancelled weeks ago. We had not been notified of any change to our booking.When I called customer services they told me that they could not provide me with an explanation and that there was nothing they could do. They suggested I try booking again and simply hung up. I checked the hotel rates immediately and noticed that they had increased by approx 25% since I made my original booking.We now have to book at a higher rate or find new accommodation as we rapidly approach our travel dates. Otherwise we will be left with thousands of pounds worth of non-refundable flights and a handful of unhappy families.I can only assume that their systems/processes are struggling and their customer service levels have deteriorated. If that is the case then they sound like a company on the brink of failure.The only other (more sinister) explanation is that they are targeting clients with early bookings/lower rates by cancelling their bookings and forcing them to re-book at higher rates... or worse to arrive at their destination only to find out that they have no booking and very limited options.In the absence of any further explanation from Booking.com either of the two scenarios above are serious cause for concern.        	                6	1	Monday	booking	positive
1028	            I wouldn't recommend this site to my worst enemy. My experience with this booking site has been nothing but a nightmare, I made a booking on this site in January 2018 to visit Amsterdam, Netherlands, this was supposed to be a trip for my birthday in March 2018. I spent £285 on a hotel for 2 nights with my partner. Due to weather conditions in the UK we were unable to fly out to Amsterdam as our flight was cancelled, the airline then tried to re-arrange our flight for Sunday 4th March but by this point we had lost our booking for the hotel. I contacted the hotel several times explaining to them about situation at the time, all they responded with was that I couldn't change my booking dates or get a refund. The staff that I spoke to were rude and arrogant over the phone, none of them seemed interested in my situation at the time and they offered no kind of help to me. I also have a friend who has recently used booking.com in December 2017 for a stag do, he was due to stay in blackpool for the weekend with 4 other people, a week before they were due to stay there booking.com contacted them to say it had been cancelled due to the hotel supposedly closing down and still to this day nearly 4 months down the line he hasn't received a refund or any kind of compensation for the inconvenience. It is safe to say that I will never be using booking.com ever again.        	                1	1	Monday	booking	negative

1030	            I booked a smart hotel for the weekend (2 nights), paying in advance to get the best rate for the room with the breakfast included option. The web site seemed to work well and gave me a confirmation number for the booking. They then proceeded to email me constantly with this offer and that offer. However, there was one critical failure in all of this, when we arrived at the hotel, they had no record of our booking, or had received our advanced payment, or that breakfast was included. At which point I felt very embarrassed at the reception whilst they were doing their best to find out if they could accommodate us or not.I strongly suggest booking.com spend a little less time emailing their customers and more actually handling their bookings which must be the key part of their service.        	                3	1	Sunday	booking	positive
1031	            OK so we had a terrible weekend late last year booking through Booking.Com when the property we had booked was bogus, then a second we were sent to also didn't exist - in all we spent a good deal of money making the weekend work and lost a third of the time trying to sort matters out.Being a fair kind of chap we thought we would give them a second chance and booked Luxury Chelsea Apartments in Ovington Square - and guess what not there, kicking up a fuss with the contact we were given two hours later texted to go to another address (good job we had a car and a satnav) after much messing around offered another luxury apartment for the weekend at the same £600. Up 6 flights of stairs - a musty and damp climb it has to be said to be confronted with a dank smelly and disgusting place to stay. Dirty soiled mattresses propped up against the walls of all the rooms and some on the floors, rubbish strewn about - a dirty kitchen with Christmas decorations still up in March, broken mirrors on the bathroom wall where you certainly would not put an uncovered foot, a toilet that had been used beyond belief and a broken seat. filthy walls and furnishings which must have come out of the ark. Our contact was surprised we declined the offer, Booking.Com when we called were less than sympathetic and asked what was wrong with the place - why couldn't we stay, finally they agreed to cancel - but you may have to pay the cancellation fee WHAT.....off sh trotted and spoke to her boss and came back full of herself that she could waive the cancellation fee - forget the fact that our original apartment didn't exist they still expected a cancellation fee. After a long time we were offered alternate accommodation, why not try BOW or Hammersmith it's not that far away - we want to be in Chelsea we explained that's why we booked it, eventually we found a hotel but by now had lost theatre tickets had to find new parking and all the food we had taken to celebrate a special weekend in an apartment was going to spoil - forget the fact the hotel was more expensive. Anyway we bought more tickets for the next day and got on with what time we had left - which was precious little.Oh and talking to CS at Booking.CON I discover they are being very reasonable offering us a first offer of a generous £25 (not each in total) for when I pointed out that they had broken a contract with me they pointed out that I should read their T and C's on the website for it appears Booking.CON just provide a platform for people to sell their product much the same way as Ebay does so although it clearly says Travel Agent at the top of this page it appears they are not, take a look at a couple of the pics (the ones I can post here at tea times anyway) maybe I will think twice before going with them again and wasting my time and money.        	                9	1	Sunday	booking	positive

This is really annoying.- be careful with the hotel rankings: they are calibrated with the commissions paid to booking.com (i.e. higher commissions improve the ranking) which is a major conflict of interest.        	                1	1	Friday	booking	positive

They had a property that had just got certified for occupation and put us there. 3 bedrooms 2 bath, kitchen, living room and pool!!

Broken doors, cupboards dirty linens and sofa even a caterpillar on the floor with an extremely dirty swimming pool. Upon contacting booking.com they refused a refund and after much pestering I only revived £45.00 as a ""goodwill"" gesture.

I received confirmation from booking.com stating my reservation has been fully canceled and I will receive a full refund and that I did not need to contact the hotel for anything further. A few days go by and I show a charge from the hotel. I emailed booking.com asking when I should expect my refund. I didn't hear anything from them. I finally called on 3/05/18 and spoke with a rep by the name of Cindya? She was very nice and told me that the hotel is not issuing a refund because I was considered a ""now show."" I explained to her that I received an email from her company @ 6 pm stating my reservation was canceled and a refund will be issued. She spoke with the hotel and her supervisor about the matter and agreed to issue a refund to me. I sent her all of the needed information to her to get this completed. Once we are in the final steps the line is disconnected.I tried calling back but I could not get someone on the line since it takes FOREVER to speak with a rep. So I emailed the rep that I was speaking with through the chain we had going asking to send confirmation that I will be refunded. 2  more days go by and I have heard NOTHING from booking.com and the charge still remains on my account. I called again on 3/07/18 waited on hold to speak with a rep for over 20 minutes. I spoke with a different rep who did not tell me their name. I proceed to explain that I have already spoken to someone prior and they were supposed to get this handled for me. The rep went on stating I was a liar and that they would have never said or done that and continued to try to over talk me. I was fed up and requested a manager. I was put on hold for about 2 minutes and the line was disconnected again. I have yet to get a hold of someone at booking.com. I have filed a dispute with my bank about this.

I have made two bookings with them recently and once booked I have realised that the booking conditions are either crazy, ie booking in London where I had to travel for 40 mins from the property to pick up the keys, or they are not clear on the first page ie when and how the deposit will be taken. I also now find their staff unhelpful and rude. They used to be a good company to use and the staff were friendly and helpful. I won't be using them anymore.        	                8	1	Sunday	booking	neutral
1048	            Shocking company to deal with. We have a holiday apartment listed with them. The guest that booked through them stayed in our apartment for 2 nights. The card was charged and the guests stayed. The guest had apparently used a stolen credit card...we only found out when we received a chargeback from the card company.Booking.com STILL took commission on the payment even though we didn't receive the money, we paid for extra cleaning because they trashed our apartment AND they stole items from our apartment.The chargeback info was sent to Booking.com accounts department who REFUSED to refund the commission.Commission on money we DIDN'T receive.        	                17	1	Sunday	booking	negative
1049	            After using booking.com for several years without incident, I think my time of using them us over.We have just returned from India and booked several hotels with 'no credit card needed' and free cancellation. Sound good on the face if it. However by not needing (or being able) to secure your room with a credit card has caused several problems.1. Our first hotel cancelled our booking by sending me a message on booking.com saying they didn't have availability and asked me to, cancel. This was dispite receiving confirmation by booking.com. This was on the morning we were due to arrive. 2. As our original hotel cancelled at last minute I had to look that morning for available hotels. We chose one nearby, at a much higher rate, as not much else was available. When we arrived at the second hotel In the afternoon we were told they didn't have a booking for us. They denied we ever booked anything, even though I showed them the confirmation from booking.com. The eventually relocated us to a nearby hotel, but tried to charge us the same price even though the advertised prices were considerably cheaper.3. We booked a hotel through the app. I found a cheaper price online and tried to claim a refund of the difference as they say they have a price match guarantee. However they denied it was a cheaper price despite me sending them a screen shot of the offer I found. When we arrived at the hotel they also had not received our booking. So 3 different hotels, 3 times I had a confirmation from booking.com but no actual booking at the hotel.I have lost faith in the system and would look for alternatives in future.        	                2	2	Sunday	booking	neutral
1050	            I booked Wyndham hotel in Daytona thru booking.com. when I checked in to hotel I walked to my room, open the windows and saw THE WALL.... I thought it some kind of mistake. I run downstairs and ask for different room. Their answer was because I booked thru booking.com and not thru hotel website they wont change my room. I couldn't stay in this room and i checked out. Hotel staff told me that they would not refund my money that i have to ask booking.com to get involved.  When i call 1st time representative at booking.com told me that she will call to hotel and call me back. Never happened.  I called 2nd time and this time very rude representative put me on hold and then told me that she cant help and no refund will be issued.  I asked her name but she wouldn't say I asked if she can transfer me to her manager she said NO. Never would use this website again !        	                1	1	Sunday	booking	negative

1052	            I have been travelling to the USA for thirty years and have always been happy. In October last year I booked through booking.com to stay in the ARC hotel in Washington DC for March this year. Booking.com booked us into a hotel that is being rebuilt and the hotel took our money early. We had to contact the hotel to get our money back and incurred a non-sterling transaction fee for the privilege of over £10. Now, 2 weeks before we go we are told our booking is cancelled as the hotel was overbooked (not true - it was actually not ready). Booking.com then wanted to book us into a lower standard hotel where the room set up was completely wrong for us and this hotel had no option to have the type of rooms we had previously booked. When I phoned booking.com and complained the girl on the phone cut me off. This is not the first time I have had the phone cut off while I was talking to them. Apparently if they cannot deal with the problem, they simply put the phone down on you. I can only rate this company and their customer services as below sub standard.

1054	            Really disappointing. Payment taken on booking when told it would be taken on arrival to the hotel. Phoned when this happened and was told sometimes they pre-authorise the card but wouldn’t be an issue. Cancelled because of snow and refusing refund. Hotel booked was Copthorne in Plymouth who were also shocking and not forthcoming with any assistance. Wouldn’t use either in the future. Have raised complaint but still not forthcoming. Will wait and see but I would suggest don’t use booking.com to book when there are so many competitors out there.        	                3	1	Friday	booking	negative
1055	            Made a booking for a hotel in Iceland months ahead of traveling.When we arrived we were told they had been over booked and packed us off in a taxi to another hotel not of our choice and new nothing about.Having made the booking through booking.com, thought everything would be okWe had a second date booked with the same hotel for two rooms just a few days later in the week. When we arrived they were turning away others as they had also been overbooked. our booking was messed up again, they only had one room on the system. It took ages to sort out.The hotel  Icelandair Reykjavik Marina gave in at the end and found us another room. Really not happy that they can overbook and just pass you on to another cheaper hotel.

At first I contacted them on the form from my account - the reply was that they would see to it.  Two days later nothing had happened, so I called them and a call centre adviser again repeated he would look into it. Yet again nothing happened. When I phoned again, ""John"" listened to my complaint and disconnected me!!  I finally cancelled the room myself and I only hope the hotel will understand my plight and not charge me for a glitch which wasn't my fault, but was due to the inadequate software at booking.com. I have booked over 100 rooms via the site, but I will avoid using them in future. Their customer service is deplorable, as other reviewers confirm.

1057	            Recently I booked a hotel in Granada on TripAdvisor (TA). The price shown was £754.04 sterling. Unknown to me the booking was actually through the TA partnership with Booking.com (B.C.) The confirmation email from B.C revealed that I was charged 850.50 Euros. My credit card company converted this figure to £754.23 and also charged me a non sterling fee of £22.24. If I had known that I would be charged in foreign currency then I would have used the card that does not charge me exchange commission. I queried this with B.C. I was told that their Terms and Conditions (T&amp;A) state that the clients will pay in the currency of the hotel. I argued that when I inserted my credit card details the amount to be paid was in sterling on TA website. They refused to reimburse me. I then approached TA. They have investigated and refunded me the fee. I hope they will take up this issue with B.C. management. In the past I have had a nasty experience with B.C and I would never knowingly use them but I thought I was booking through TA. Whatever T&amp;A B.C may have, the customers should pay what they see on the screen. In this instance B.C policy is dishonest!        	                11	1	Friday	booking	negative

I asked about the pre authorisation process and was informed that this money had left my account and I was being charged interest from that day.How is this pay at the property, I have paid a week early as confirmed by my Bank, no matter how you dress this up, it is a con and Booking.com and Best western need to say exactly what is happening.I have booked through BOOKING.COM many times and this is the first time I have booked with Best Western and it will be the last.

They take your money then says you have to prove that you paid a deposit - they want copies of bank statements with all your private information on there.  I have sent at least seven emails to them and still they have done nothing.  Someone did phone me but was talking about a different booking and lack of his English and my accent (London) was too difficult for him to write down my landline. I asked Antonio to get a manager to call me he said NO!On top of this I have a booking in USA and when I found somewhere cheaper and sent them a screenshot they said they were cheaper because the sent me the price back in USD when I paid and sent in GBP and it was exactly the same deal which they do not disagree!  It is all well and dandy when a problem does not arise.  But I thought there was meant to be peace of mind going through this shambles of a company.

1070	            So, as a party of 2, we had to travel to Silverdale, and as it's a long drive, we decided to book a hotel through booking.com. We found a reasonably priced hotel for the night - Clayton Lodge hotel. The pictures Booking.com have on their site make the hotel appear very nice. We arrived at Clayton Lodge, and quickly realised the hotel was nothing like the pictures. The hotel is extremely run down, and should actually be shut down for health and safety concerns. The room was absolutely disgusting. The ceiling and walls were full of cracks, and there was masses of dirt and dust all over the room. The main issue with Booking.com, was the cancellation policy. Even if we decided not to stay in the hotel, we would still have to pay. On top of that, they are still allowing this hotel to show very old pictures, from when it appeared relatively nice.        	                1	1	Monday	booking	positive

We have to overbook because many travelers don't show up"". All this even though I had received a confirmation from Booking.com and an email stating that if I didn't show up they would charge my credit card half the amount due for the 4 nights!!! Had reached this destination, Yelapa (Mexico), by Water Taxi at night, and I was a woman crying on this solitary beach from 8pm to 11pm, as a few inhabitants of this lost resort explained there were no rooms available this time a year. Was totally trapped because there were no more Water Taxis to leave this village till morning. At 11:pm, decided to go banging at the various doors of the hotel  I had booked...as I simply couldn't stay out alone, without a blanket or any water all night!! A nice Canadian guest let me in, and after 2 hours of conversing and searching rooms online together, he offered for me to sleep in one of the two beds he had. I don't know what I would've done without this kind Canadian man...      Two months ago, in Santo Domingo, the room I booked was pure rubbish: All broken, bathroom flooded, no lighting, even though cost was $150 a night. After 2 nights, Booking.com assured me I could leave and that I would get a refund for $500 for the remaining nights. This never happened!! THEY STOLE MY MONEY!!! Disgusting, dishonest, unethical... I was willing to take the Santo Domingo experience as an ""error"" from Booking.com and was stupid enough to book again through them.  BY THE WAY, IN MEXICO, BOOKING.COM CANNOT BE REACHED...

Booking.com are very quick to take the money out of your account as soon as you mention 'Cancel' because to them, they lost their commission.We accepted the terms that we missed the 3 day cancellation policy and we did pay the full 2 night stay to booking.com.However, we wouldn't have emailed the hotel directly and asked why have they charged us again, a separate bill as a 'No Show' on the day of Check-In.The hotel was not informed that we cancelled through booking.com 3 days ago. The hotel apologised and refunded us back.Moral of the Story.Read the hotel's website about their Cancellation Policy.

Instead I received a text from the 'owner' of Loft Aziz directing me to an alternative flat that was owned by a friend of his. I ignored the text and found a more expensive hotel nearby. Booking.com have refused to reimburse me the difference in cost and there is also a risk that I will be charged a 'no show' fee.

1078	"            Summary: The description of some of the hotels in Booking.com is wrong and misleading. On their website, I booked a hotel which was advertised as a 4-star hotel, although it doesn't have any stars.In February 2018, I had a business trip to London. I searched for 4-star hotel in the centre. I used the 4-star  filter in Booking.com and sorted the results by ratings. The first hotel in the list was Nadler Victoria Hotel, which I booked. When I arrived at the hotel, I was very disappointed by the situation there. The Nadler Victoria hotel apparently doesn't have a restaurant or a bar or actually, anything except rooms. It is an expensive fancy hostel advertised as a 4-star hotel, which it is not. I shared my concerns with the staff working at the reception desk, and they told me that Nadler Victoria Hotel doesn't have any stars and it is not categorised with the ""stars"" system. There are no stars on the website of the hotel, but there are stars at booking.com, which I find very misleading and false advertising.I wrote to Booking.com Customer Service, and I received a reply after 10 days. The answer was a simple CS template. Later, I received another email from CS, where I was offered 25 euros refund as a compensation for my troubles. This is simply ridiculous. I paid 400 euros for two nights. I would never book this hotel if I knew that it was not a proper 4-star hotel. I was misled by the false information in Booking.com, which they did not correct even when I sent them a complaint. It seems to me that they don't care and they just want their listings to look good in Booking.com.So, I am disappointed that a hotel without any stars is listed as 4-star hotel. I am disappointed that Booking.com did not admit or fixed their mistake. I am disappointed by their compensation proposal, although I used their services (Booking.com, Rentalcars.com, Agoda.com) from at least five years, maybe more.

These bookings have been in many different countries, such as Ireland, Brazil, Holland, Senegal, England, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Spain, Kenya, Ethiopia, Ghana, Zambia, Uganda, Thailand, Seychelles, Cambodia, Vietnam and Singapore. Problems - none. Could I reach them easily by phone when I had a query or two - yes. Have they gone the extra mile - yes: I booked a Brazilian Airport Hotel on a low no-refund rate and had to cancel, but as I was chatting on the phone with them, they asked if I minded if they contacted the hotel to see if they would refund anyway. They did. In my mind, why go elsewhere?        	                7	5	Thursday	booking	neutral

The owner had withdrawn the payment (plus 10 euro). I called Booking uk service number and was told this was how it worked, nothing wrong here.

1082	            After years of using booking.com, I will never use them again. Last year, I booked an hotel at reasonable price for a stay from 27th of May to 7th of June 2018 for a business trip. 3 weeks ago, I received strange messages from the hotel owner, advising me I should cancel my reservation as the hotel was being sold. The hotel is, strangely, still advertised on the website. Contacting booking.com has been a joke and they have failed to offer a solution or show empathy for the awful situation they have put me in. I was first promised not to worry and that they were working to find a replacement accommodation locally at no extra cost and would cover the difference if needed. Then radio silence. I chased over the phone a week ago and was told, by rude callcenter agents likely based in India that since the hotel was sold, it's not in their insurance policy to help me or their concern. I requested the recorded phone calls to be audited and asked for my complaint to be escalated to management with a solution offered. They have left it so late that no accommodation is available at a festive period in small villages where the work is taking place. No response to emails and my calls are put on hold for 20 minutes while being advised I will hear back or get a call back. Today I receive a template email inviting me to book a random hotel 18 miles away with no public transport options at a higher price, no explanation and no sorry. I cannot find anything with airbnb as they left it too late for a solution. Last week I was also told on the day of a checkin that the hotel could not accommodate me but they had found me accommodation in a dodgy hotel at an opposite direction 7 miles away. I cancelled but had to wait 10 days for the refund. This company has really gone downhill. Also I would be careful with rogue customer service policies where hotels that are bankrupt or being sold are still advertised months after knowing they are being sold, it tells a lot about booking.com management and strange practices ...        	                2	1	Wednesday	booking	negative
1083	            Dear Booking.com.When can you please fix the possibility to book an accommodation with kids? Once selecting a family including kids (and age), I would expect to see rates for the entire family.Too often the hotel locally charges additional rates for kids.It's probably in the terms somewhere, but please work towards transparency.CheersAlex        	                4	3	Wednesday	booking	positive

1089	            I have used Booking.com a couple of times now and I have to say that the booking process has been fine.  Due to an unforeseen issue with the hotel for my last booking, I was due a refund for one night.  This was agreed with the hotel owner and confirmed by Booking.com.  What followed was nothing less than a debacle that has taken several hours of my time and some of the hotel owner's time to resolve.  Without going through the tedious sequence of e-mails and phone-calls required to finally get my money, suffice it to say that it has taken nearly a month and I will be very wary of using this company again.  I wonder whether I would have received a refund at all without the intervention of the hotel owner?        	                2	2	Monday	booking	positive

1091	            I was scammed by Booking.com and their fraudulent lowest-price guarantee.A few days after booking a hotel stay using Booking.com, I found the exact same room at the exact same hotel on the exact same dates for about $30 less.So I followed the process advertised on Booking.com to receive a credit for the amount they overcharged me.I even sent them a link and a screenshot showing the lower price (which I was offered using Hotel.com).After a few days, Booking.com sent me some nonsense message about how the information I sent them was invalid, and/or I wasn't eligible for any refund/credit, nor could I cancel the reservation.So due to them ripping me off for $30, I will NEVER EVER use Booking.com again. Which is their loss, because in the past I was a good customer for them (purchasing about $2,000 worth of services each year).I have found Hotels.com to be a far better option for hotel reservations.My recommendation to all is DON'T USE BOOKING.COM.

1092	            We used the booking.com online app to book a cottage for a night in France for 3 adults and 4 children. The app quoted a price based on the occupant data entered and processed the booking taking full payment. The cottage owner was incorrectly informed by the automated system that the booking was for 4 adults - even though at no point had this been stated. The cottage owner (Gites des Sablon) then tried to levy additional charges for the children on the day of the booking. We cancelled and they refused to refund 90€ of our fee. Very dissatisfied!!!

1099	"            I recently made a reservation through Booking.com and was given a price of £754 that included bed, breakfast &amp; dinner for 6 nights. It seemed very low in relation to other prices and I queried it with Booking.com. They assured me, in writing, that it had been ""double-checked"" &amp; was correct. I then went ahead &amp; booked flights, insurance, car hire. About 2 weeks later I received a message saying that the price was wrong and that I needed to pay a further £75 per night (£450 in total) to include dinner. I naturally baulked at this &amp; complained to Booking.com since they had checked &amp; verified the price earlier. I emailed them stating as error was theirs they should fund the difference.  I got no reply, even after resending the message twice. In the end I telephoned &amp; I got nowhere, just insincere apologies, and they made no effort to resolve the problem. As I was committed to travel, I grudgingly said OK, I would accept the original price as being for for bed &amp; breakfast only. Unbelievably I was then told that this wasn't possible &amp; that I would still need to pay a further £18 per night (£108 total)!  As a result &amp; in anger I cancelled the reservation completely and  I will NEVER use booking.com again. ( I managed to book an alternative hotel direct, but it has still cost me much more than I wanted to spend).Then I tried to remove/close my account with Booking.com - guess what - the option to do so did NOT work. Finally I found a website called ""Accountkiller"" and through them I believe I have managed to close it, but whilst their website now says it doesn't recognise my old log-in details, I've no way of being sure they really have cleared my details from their records. I strongly advise people NOT to book through this company. Use them by all means to find hotel details &amp; deals, but having done so, go direct to the hotel to finalise your reservation. It's a much safer option.        "	                15	1	Friday	booking	positive

He claimed a 250 euro ""cleaning fee""  even though we cleaned everything when we were not contractually obliged to!

1101	            CHEATED!I thought I had found a good holiday deal on booking.com. No it ain't. As I was booking I was informed I would make a payment on my arrival at the hotel. But to my surprise the following day Holiday inn had deducted a full amount for my holiday stay- which is in mid March 2018.  I had not budgeted for this money to be instantly deducted from my account. Instead, I wanted to pay for my hotel stay at the end of February ( after my pay day). Now my account is in an overdraft because of this. I feel cheated and I don't think I will ever use BOOKING.com again. I gave one star but if there was an option for zero stars i would have certainly chosen that. I called holiday inn to query this and spoke to Andra. She advised me to contact Booking.com and gave me the telephone number. I spoke to Victoria on 15/2/18 at 2120hrs and expressed my disgruntlement. She informed me that the room i had chosen had 2 options: prepayment and payment on arrival. That is not true at all. There was only 1 price. The email i received confirms I pay on arrival. The booking on Booking.com app confirms the same. Victoria told me there was nothing she could do and said i had chosen this. No I was actually misled and I am not happy at all. When i insisted to speak to someone more senior than her, she hung up on me. Is that good customer care?

On previous occasions we've been informed that our card has been debited to arrive at a hotel and be told we haven't paid at all.  Did we pay twice??

It comes to February and payment is taken to the tune of £1, 834.80. On calling this bunch of thieves, I am told that there is a 7% charge and taxes on top (which doesn't even calculate) and this information WAS NOT STATED WHEN I BOOKED. The fool I spoke to on their customer service line swore blind that I was told this in my confirmation email, but there is absolutely NOTHING stated about the fact there will be extra charges. Had I been told this it would have made me think twice about booking what was already an expensive stay. This company used to be ok - often no prepayment needed on most accommodations, but they have become greedier and greedier over the years and now are hiding charges from their customers and basically thieving from them. I will NEVER use them again. Plus, I resent speaking to a customer service advisor in AMERICA when I am phoning a UK number, and speaking to someone who is advising me in DOLLARS, when I paid in pound sterling, and talking about extra taxes like this is the norm.

I started what was to become a 6 week conversation with booking.com customer service bods - complete with screen shots of their 'taxes &amp; service charge included' offering - to get them to understand that was false advertising at the least and fallacious at most. The first round of replies told me that that could not happen! I thought they were kidding when I was asked to provide tham with the screen shot on the day of booking!??  Do I have that?Of course not. I suggested that someone check the current website which still shows taxes included.

1117	            I have been booking hotel places several times through booking website and two times end in horible accomodation by the hotels. Like everybody know a hotels usualy get stars, but these stars in many cases are not responding to the reality, category class, trained staff, cleaneness, condition of the hotel room,etc. So when you book a hotel room through booking website they are playing a third part role and they are not responcible for anything what hapen after you pay for this service. They provide service and are charging meanwhile so if there is a problem between the hotel administration and you the costumer this booking company dont play any legal role to help you for solving your problem in the hotel.Please look at the room and check carefully all the comments in the net and then pay for it. Dont trust in some published photos by the hotels in the booking webs and also dont over trust to the booking websites. They take money from you but dont want to be responsible if it's a problem because they dont care in what you end after you book. There is no regular control in the hotels by the local authorities neather them who give them the category stars so better to pay more and book in four or five star hotel instead of three star or lower. There is no guaranty for you as a costumer and refund system in the booking website so therefore computer said ONE star for booking dot com.We booked a hotel called hotel Carina 3 stars, Kulmgasse 22, A 1070 Wien throughout booking.com, just to try for 3 nights. It was a night mare. This was an Arabic hotel, managed by muslim staff.They was nice when we came but we see right away this hotel was not Austrian style. This was another world and the local people know this district nr.17 as the little Istanbul of Vienna. We got the key of the room nr 206, they told us in the phone the manager have upgrade us to a suite. First thing we see was a dirty carpet, bed smelling room, yellow walls, greece in the bathroom, some bacterial smell. The fan in the bathroom was blocked of bakterial dust, and is very dirty never cleaned. We took the decision to stay at least over the night and investigate the breakfast early in the morning. The worst we ever have try. Expired and old food. They called continental breakfast not at all, the coffee machine was giving 10 drops in the cup. All our clothes are smelling bed after the stay one night so then we have wash it all after we moved to a 4 stars world wide chain.We go directly to the room 206 took our personal staff and check out. They said we will get refund but we never received. We thank them and one of us thank the muslim lady outside with the hand like we do in the western country's front of the taxi driver we order by phone. The hotel said to our booking agency:The property had reached out to us to claim that you had taken photos of staff without permission, and that there was an instance of physical contact without permission.In these cases, we are unable to confirm or verify, and this is only what the property had reported to us. In this case, I would advise that you contact a legal party or law enforcement agency, as we are unable to interfere or do anything in these instances, as we are a third party.What the Hotel claim that we had taken photos of staff without permission, and that there was an instance of physical contact without permission. We took photo when we check out, physical contact without permission.What?: we thank them for the understanding with a hand. Later we found out no refund honest not at all ! This is not Austrian style, rather then muslim style.hotel Carina have your rule clear we don't know your culture and are not interesting even - we are not muslim we respect you and exist the same from you this is Austria not islam.The reception arabic staff point to us that two mens cannot sleep in one bed therefore they gave us a suit 3 beds.This thinking is only in the Muslim world. We were in Austria(Europe) We don't recommend this hotel to any European, Asian or Western Citizens.

1123	"            I made a reservation to stay at the Days INN Donegal, PA hotel. I looked for almost 2 hours at hotels around the Greensburg-Donegal PA area before happening on Booking.Com. I went through the search for Donegal and settled on the Days INN. The reason...the website clearly stated that all reservations were cancelable until Feb 11, at the earliest. I KNOW I didn't select a non cancelable reservation because I knew my travel plans could very well change and I might not be in Donegal the night I was supposed to be. Sure enough, my plans changed, and I will not be in Donegal on Feb 13 to use the hotel. I went to cancel and found out it's a non cancelable reservation. I have been in contact with Booking.com several times trying to get this issue resolved. I have been on their website and seen that they still have rooms available for the night I was supposed to be there and they are all free cancellations. But, mine isn't? I have been in touch with the hotel and the manager is ""out of the country"" and the person I'm talking to at the hotel apparently has no power to right a wrong, or the stomach, to do cancel the reservation.I don't know which it is. What I do know is what type of reservation I thought I was making...a free cancellation reservation.Booking.com should be ashamed of themselves. There is obviously an error here, and they are doing nothing to help a customer. Conversely, they are doing everything they can to bilk me out of $72. It's really not the money. I couldn't care less about $72. I don't like being taken advantage of, and I don't like a dishonest website. My opinion is Booking.com is both.        "	                1	1	Saturday	booking	negative

So we booked it( ofcourse with no refunds) when er arrived at the hotel, the hotel looked like a ""ruin"" (an really ugly building that looked like it was about to fall down). We gave it a shot. The room was maybe 8-10m2, with some really nasty bedsheets, and pillows. The bathroom had fungus in the top corner of the room.(no way!!) It was ofcourse aVery moist room we had. No wonder why it had fungus in it... As i Can see, booking.com should have payed the whole f****** thing! But they didnt, the hotel wouldnt Pay anything. I think i got 15% back from booking.com(Should have Been 100% with a payed room somewhere Else) instead i got 15% and alot of wasted time!! Never ever again!

1134	"            DO NOT MAKE PAYMENTS TO BOOKING.COM! Any technical errors that occur on their website even though it is not your fault, will cost you all of your money! There are fundamental issues within their system.Absolutely scandalous behaviour from booking.com and they're customer service team!On the 1st February I pre-paid £550 for 2 ApartHotels in the city centre of Manchester for Friday 9th February. There was a free cancellation period of 7 days before check in date on the booking.On the 4th February at around 4:00AM I logged on to their site keeping in mind that I had already passed the free cancellation period. I went on to Manage My Bookings page and I saw two key options along with a couple of others. The key options were;Option 1: Cancel room (red writing - full cancellation fee/no refund)Option 2: Request free cancellation  At 04:28AM I pressed option 2 and I am so glad I took a screenshot of the prompt on my phone which is also time stamped.The message under request free cancellation is as follows;""It can take up to 48 hours for the property to respond to your request to waive cancellation fees. It's up to the their discretion to waive fees and until then, your booking is still valid.""I did this twice for each of my apartments keeping in mind that I just wanted to see if the property would waiver the fees, otherwise I would keep my booking.(If I really wanted to cancel why wouldn't I click option 1?)However, at 4:28AM and 4:29AM I received emails from booking.com telling me my booking has been modified and cancelled, the second email said, you have been successfully cancelled for £550.I immediately called the customer service team to ask why it had been cancelled and told the rep that I requested a free cancellation. An email was then sent by the rep to the property owner asking if I could have a refund or booking back in which I had a reply 4 hours later to tell me I couldn't have neither.I then spoke with a senior customer service rep, who escalated the issue to the IT department advising that she had spoke to the IT team and there is a possibility of a bug and they would have to investigate.I received an email today and here is a snippet: ""I checked the cancellation of this guest and the cancellation was made from the guest's IP and via Manage booking page. It does not look like any technical error on the website. The cancellation automation worked fine for me and no errors detected when I tried to test this.I can only assume the guest clicked the wrong option after choosing 'Can I cancel for less?' the guest might have clicked the wrong button and selected to cancel instead of sending a waiver request to the property.I will attach a screenshot of options to your ticket as paste bin does not work at the moment.""First of all, the option isn't even called 'Can I cancel for less?' Even their paste bin doesn't work, and at the same time they're not taking responsibility of the technical error that I experienced. I called them immediately after it happened and they couldn't do anything. How can a giant global company behave in such a way? How can I go from having Paid £550 for 2 apartments in my name to no apartments in my name and no refund within seconds? It just doesn't make sense, this is not right!The senior customer service team reps were so unhelpful I called once more to query the IT investigation as I didn't think it was a fair judgement on their part. The senior member called Mikaa told me she could escalate the issue if she wanted to but refused to do so as she didn't think it was necessary and she will be cutting the phone and will not be helping me any further for a refund.

1135	"            I am so disappointed about my experience  with booking that  I don`t even know where to start. I  made a reservation on 23rd of January for 3rd of February as I was going to travel to the Peak district. There were mixed messages about the payment at the time of the booking, so I thought to double check with booking when I have completed the reservation. I called booking an adviser told me he is not sure, so he will double check and ring me next day, which didn`t happen. I have then received an email from the hotel on 2nd of February at about 5pm stating that booking.com have booked 6 rooms and hotel only had 5 rooms left... so I had to stay on hold for over 10 minutes to booking, I have then got cut off and had to stay on hold for another 15 minutes to get thru to someone who told me there are no notes on the system about the issue, the 2nd adviser then called the hotel and told me that indeed I will need to choose a different hotel. I have spend another 30 minutes to find hotel that I am happy with, had to do the second booking myself ???? So I wasn`t very happy that I had to go thru all that I spend over an hour the night before I was going to travel. An adviser told there is not a lot that can be done, all I was told was "" I would have been frustrated, if I was you"" I though  I had enough and I wouldn`t even bother arguing and logging a complaint. Went to my strip check in the hotel, all good, went to check out to reception, handed the key, the receptions told me  we don`t have to pay to them, as the payment gets sorted thru booking. Left the hotel, got an email 1 hr later stating: ****** Hall Country House Hotel informed us that during your stay (reservation 13117319**) their policies were not respected. You left the property without paying and you owe them a total of ** GBP. Please make this payment immediately.If you have any questions about these charges, please contact the property directly at +44 1298 *****All the best,--Nikki D.Booking.com Customer Service Team""I honestly could not believe I have got this disgraceful email. I called booking was on hold for over 10 minutes again, although their  message says the waiting time is less then 5 minutes...I can`t really understand what is the point of this message, when it`s clearly not true. Anyway, got thru an adviser that didn`t even apologise out  of courtesy at the beginning of the call, he called the hotel and came back to me stating apparently they don`t have my CCV  code...I am not how is that they don`t have it as this is a mandatory field  when you make the booking. Anyway I don`t quite get how is that they don`t have my CCV code, the same as I didn`t respect the policy of the hotel....and left without paying. I have then rang the hotel, who confirmed to me all they said to booking is that they need my updated bank details, as I already have left the hotel. I have told the adviser that I want to make an official complaint and I was promised I will receive an email regarding that, which again surprise, surprise didn`t happen, as I didn`t receive no email. I believe that as a booking agent who charge fees and it`s there to manage customer expectation, booking.com should take full responsibility when there is a problem, instead of referring the problem m back to the hotel, when clearly the hotel didn`t do anything wrong, It was booking.com website that allowed customers more rooms that there were available, It was booking.com that don`t follow up on the bookings, bookings.com representatives that don`t do follow ups with the customers, booking.com customer service sending emails with disgraceful  content,as they clearly could`t understand what the issue is and why the hotel couldn`t proceed the payment.I think the above description speaks better then any comments I can make. All I can say is that I will really try to avoid booking.com in future and try to book my stay with the hotel direct.        "	                4	1	Monday	booking	positive

A few weeks later when reviewing my booking again, i noticed that the apartment was no longer registered on booking.com but my booking was still on my account. A quick search shown that a new property called WHS Cozy Lofts, Haarlem was available with the same rooms available. So i had a booking advising i had 3 apartments but this company was letting out the same 3 apartments under a slightly diffrent name.

I pre-paid for the reservation in full, as the hotel required me to do so in order to confirm the booking.  On 17 January the hotel cancelled the reservation without explanation (Booking.com said it was because of ""over booking"") and I have still, almost three weeks later, not received a refund of the monies which I pre-paid.  I have contacted both the hotel and Booking.com about this several times and have received no response at all from the former and the latter is now simply ignoring my e-mails - and not letting my leave a negative review for the property on their site in order to warn other customers that this is a potential ""scam"" hotel that is taking money and not honouring bookings.  I am so upset and frustrated by this experience as it has left me without accommodation and quite a bit of money and Booking.com doesn't seem to be prepared to help me in any way to get it back.  I am also really shocked that they are still allowing the hotel to advertise on their site - I think they should be threatening to remove its listing unless the monies are refunded in order to protect other customers from going through the same experience.   I can't recommend anyone to book through them - as it seems to me that if anything does go wrong with your reservation they won't be prepared to help you at all.  They also seem happy to go on listing potentially ""bogus"" hotels that don't honour their reservations.I would also warn anyone against booking the Shang Ke She Youth Homestay on any website (although I think it is only advertised on Booking.com) as, from my experience, it seems like it may be a bogus/fake hotel.  Certainly they have not responded to any of my e-mails and have failed to provided me with any refund.        "	                2	1	Friday	booking	negative
1140	"            Just booked an apartment with Booking.com. First of all, the most stressful hotel booking experience ever, with text in red and green showing up everywhere I clicked saying ""1 room left!"" - ""Hurry, this accommodation is not normally available!"" - ""Sorry, this hotel is fully booked, just missed out!"" (Why are you telling me about hotels that I can't book?)So with my heart rate already raised, I 'panic-found' an apartment that I would like to book. Total price in big green number: €510. ""ONLY 1 ROOM LEFT AT THIS PRICE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, BOOK THIS SECOND OR YOU'LL NEVER GET THIS CHANCE EVER AGAIN AND YOUR HOLIDAY WILL BE RUINED AND ALL YOUR FRIENDS WILL HATE YOU AND YOU'LL DIE ALONE!""I contacted the rest of the group travelling and after much hassle (they are in 4 different time zones), finally got the okay to book it. Went back in, started the non-refundable reservation process and there in the small print was a €160 cleaning fee, a €120 linen fee (wth is a linen fee anyway? Are Peruvian virgins weaving this linen especially for me?) and a tourist fee of €36.So the price that they advertised was 40% lower than the real price!!!! And when was the first time that they had the real figure of €817 written on the screen? When I had already paid the reservation. Of course.I don't know if they think we all fell off a vegetable truck yesterday, but there's absolutely no way that this false advertising would be considered acceptable by any customer, small print or no small print. That's a huge discrepancy. And how on earth do they allow their sellers to charge a cleaning fee that is almost half the cost of the actual accommodation fee? What do they think I'm going to be doing in that apartment??Anyway, wrote them an email. No reply. Sent a report to the CMA and Advertising Standards Authority.

1141	"            I have recently used booking.com to book an apartment in Brighton to stay at green diamond apartments for a 21st birthday! Before arriving communication with the agent Alex was very good seemed pleasant. Even stayed on the phone to help us get to the apartment as we were trying to find it for nearly an hour. When arriving outside to meet the person who was giving us the key first impressions were not good as you would expect the person to be wearing smart casual clothes which this person was not. We were then told when entering the apartment that the previous people staying there had stolen the balcony keys so this was unaccessible which we indeed paid extra for. Once that person had left we looked to make sure everything else was in order when noticing the electric oven top was cracked and u could see the electrics. WiFi was also unaccessible as owner had bill outstanding. While having a cigarette downstairs as building is no smoking three homeless guys forced open the door downstairs with not much force at all and proceeded towards the lift then went in. When telling the guys who we were with they decided to go and investigate what was going on. They came back down with the three homeless guys who were injecting themselves with heroin on the 4th floor stairwell which is the floor we were staying on. If they had of accidently set a fire we would of had no where to go as balcony was unaccessible. When calling the agent Alex about this he said quote ""what can I do"" I can see about a partial refund he then said he would call us the morning after this occurred which he did not follow through with and when calling him said he was ill and that he was going to send an email that second to see about the refund and would make sure he would give us a call before we checked out at 11:00 am the following day. 11:05 the following day and no call had come through so I decided to give Alex a call myself as I had to the entire time we were there when he answered he proceeded to tell me he was in a meeting which I was angry about as we were waiting for his call all morning he then said the amount of refund they would give would be 10% I did not agree and told him this was unacceptable due to no balcony, no WiFi, broken cooker and drug addicts breaking in. It's not right! I asked for an email to complain further and he put the phone down. I called back instantly and the phone rang and rang and rang! No communication. He tried to call back an hour later! But I refused to speak to such a rude human being!!! Never again will me or any of the group I went with be staying there again! Or using booking. Com as they are clearly not aware of what the apartment actually looks like or in tails.        "	                1	1	Friday	booking	negative

I have tried to complain to booking.com (who make their complaints department quite difficult to find in their website!) and I sent  a lengthy message explaining the experience, including having in vain to sort things out on the telephone and having come across incompetent and rude personnel.  Today I received an answer requesting details and addressing me as someone else!  I will be going all the way to their CEO if necessary, but as a company it is completely untrustworthy.   Just like Airbnb! Bad Customer Services, means no interest in going through them again.  One can find hotels (on their website!) and then write or call the hoteldirectly ( they orefer it too of course!).   The only reason to go through Booking.com is the expectation that there will be good customer support in the case of a problem, but this is annihilated as a reason to go with Booking.com as in our case, the owner was very helpful and Booking.com deceitful.        	                4	1	Friday	booking	negative

Apparently she made a mistake with the price but lied to us that apartment was still under renovation and wouldn't be available for dates we booked it. After we contacted booking.com she agreed to rent it for the original price but she sent to booking.com false information about invalid card details , my husband went to his bank and confirmed the card details were absolutely fine and the owner of Apartamento Crochet shouldn't have any problem with taking deposit but  she found another excuse not to rent us this apartment by sending  false information to booking.com. Apartamento Crochet has been cancelled without our permission even though my husband's debit card was still valid. I think that's disgusting. We asked booking.com to help us to find another apartment in similar price around Faro. We have never received any reply, despite trying to contact them many times, our messages were totally ignored. We are frequently traveling around the Europe, always used booking.com , never had any problems until we have this issue and booking.com did nothing to help us. We have already booked flights tickets to Faro just after we found Apartamento Crochet so we still need a place to stay in Faro and the only thing we asked for was to help us to find something similar in a similar price because we can't exceed our budget.

They do not answer to my messages.I have already paid and I have sent booking - customer service and email but I did not received any answer.The check in is in less than 12 hours, please find me another place.        	                5	1	Thursday	booking	positive
1150	"            Don't use this company. It is that simple. Absolute shocker of a company. Avoid them as you would bubonic plague. Just like with other ""booking sites"", if anything goes wrong, and I mean anything, they will tell you ""sorry but by law we are just the booking company and not liable for anything that goes wrong."" So you are on your own. They get a cut, they advertise the hotels, they exist simply because they help you book with hotels, but if anything goes wrong with the booking, guess who is off the hook? Yup. booking.com has absolutely no liability and won't help you. Added to that, you can get cheaper accommodation by writing to the hotel directly and bargaining! Or just go to airbnb!I am in the process of working with some MEPs to get this changed. No company in the EU should be allowed to take people's money for an advertised product and then have no liability if anything goes wrong. There are advertising laws against this and booking.com is breaking them daily!        "	                3	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

1154	            Their price guarantee is a con trick. Booked a private apartment on their web site for May knowing it was cheaper on HomeAway. Poor reviews of HomeAway put me off booking with them direct. So booked with Bookings.com believing that they would 'price match' and having used them before. Put in a price match claim showing the same lower price for both the  week before and after. They replied, as they cannot check the actual week on HomeAway (of course they cannot as they have booked it for me), they cannot price match. So their 'price match' guarantee is meaningless for anything other than a hotel that is not fully booked for exactly the dates you have booked.        	                4	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

1156	            I've used Booking.com multiple times and it's a rather good service. The main problem appears when I try to contact the place I booked and check if they even heard about Booking.com or not so I can be sure about the service that will be provided. It varies from country to country, sometimes the booking cancels just because the owners of the place don't really care about orders from booking.com and they used it for additional bookings but they didn't really match it with the real availability at the time. I suggest Booking.com pay more attention to communication with their partners but it's overall 4 star, in my opinion        	                3	4	Tuesday	booking	neutral
1157	            Worst company ever!! Booked an apartment for 4 people in London. Bin bags outside the building, junk under the stairs coming out of the cupboard. The person never handed us the keys so he was just walking in and out as he pleases, duvets on the floor so he asked us to wait outside while they clean. When we got in the apartment, it didn’t look like the images, weird smell, a bed in the kitchen next to the stove, faeces in the toilet and broken stuff. We complained to the apartment owner/worker and booking.com customer service. Customer service woman was rude and did not let me explain a word. The owner kicked us out. Asked my friends to make a quick decision so he could put the place back on the market. On the phone over an hour with customer service with no help. All she could do was tell us to go back to the place, in which the apartment worker didn’t open the door for us. We were stranded and had to spend more money to book another hotel (using hotels site). Tried to review the place but the booking changed to cancelled. Lesson learnt... Never using this company again. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMERS!!        	                2	1	Monday	booking	negative

In the bottom of webpage is signed extra charges in small font. In my case it was the cleaning. The apartment cost is 65 euro a day and cleaning almost the same. 50 euro. It is not included in price you see before the confirmation. It is hidden from the customer. In case you chose the most interesting deal it is not refundable.

1166	            We've used Booking.com recently to book a weeks accommodation in Austria. The price we have ended up paying is not the same as what we booked. We were shown a price throughout all stages of the booking process which was in pounds - on the search listing, on the hotel page and on the booking page. The confirmation has then come through in euros and the money that has come out of our account is nowhere near what was on the website. Not only that but we've also received a sizeable credit card charge for the transaction. This is an underhand practice by Booking.com - using one price to get you interested and then billing another one (no doubt they'll have covered themselves in the small print). If the pound amount isn't valid, then don't show it on the site. I'll never use them again.        	                5	1	Friday	booking	positive

Didn’t even help me to found an other place with a discount for the inconvenience. Ridiculous. Instead your employe was talking about your commission that you will lose if I have less. Where is your customer happiness ? You lose me as a client for sure. I canceled all my trip with you accept the one in feb-March. And after my trip I’m going to cancel my account.

1168	            Thank you for your reply to my Trustpilot review of 10th January 2018 Booking.com.  Why are you able to reply to me on Trustpilot and yet you haven't responded to the 4 terrible reviews I returned to you by email and why hasn't one of your Directors replied to my email??? Also, when I made the booking, the website didn't make clear a choice for 1,2,3,4,5,+ occupants despite me clearly inputting that I was travelling with 2 adults and 3 children? Guess what you've changed the accommodation occupancy website choices for that apartment since my complaint.  You haven't addressed that you initially verbally asked me to pay 4 times more for my holiday which is an extra £2,400 when you telephoned me on 31st December 2017?  We were travelling very early on 2nd January 2018. You could hear how upset I was at the news and yet I still had to ring and ring you on 31st during a family New Year dinner and in the end we were arguing over 27 euros on 1st January because I challenged you?  Why didn't you answer voicemails promptly? Why won't you put through complaints to a senior member of staff when it was clear my complaint wasn't resolved?? Why were you still adamant that I had to pay 56 euros at the apartment and then send my receipt to you on return for a 27 euro refund?  Why would you put your reputation at risk for 27 euros?? It's clear from the Trustpilot reviews that I have read since my holiday that your customer service is appalling.  Why doesn't that bother you? It's clear from your response to my Trustpilot review that you are not professional about customer service.

1171	            We booked a hotel with booking.com in Bangkok for an overnight stay before flying home. The hotel was £55 so for Thailand not a cheap hotel. On checking in the room was vile, dirty, run down, barely fit for a rat to live in. We went to reception and advised them we where going to leave and they informed us they could not refund we had to contact booking.com. So on our return to England that is what I did, I sent them photographs of the rooms state and explained the situation. 7 Days later they have advised they cannot refund me as I should have 'picked a better hotel' their words. The difference between the photos on their site and the reality is shocking. I will NEVER use booking.com again for personal or business use, and I strongly advise you avoid them at all costs. Customer services are rude and unhelpful. Luckily on this occasion I have only lost £55 and we managed to find somewhere suitable for our family that night.

With only a few weeks to go we received a bland email stating they were cancelling the booking and apologised for the inconvenience. We have only been able to find similar accommodation for over double the price, plainly because it’s very close to our travel date. I contacted Booking.com with the reasonable expectation they would cover at least some of the additional cost, but got a ‘couldn’t care less’ attitude from their representative. When I asked him if he considered what they had done was reasonable he said ‘it doesn’t matter what I say’. Customer relations epic fail....... I’m still waiting for a supervisor to call me back, and am not holding my breath 😶*Update*I don’t have Twitter, so my travel companion contacted Booking.com as requested. They are ‘not able’ to cover the difference in price. Why? Are they skint? Perhaps a more accurate terminology would be they are unwilling. Quite a different meaning between the two. We got an obviously stock, cut and paste, and frankly lame, reply to our Twitter DM. It seems to me that Booking.com want to be seen to be keen to resolve an issue (hence their reply to my initial review) but when it comes down to it they really don’t care one iota. A case of them being too big to care about individuals. I will, whenever possible, avoid Booking.com as a matter of principle whenever possible in the future, even if it ends up costing me more.

1190	            Dear Booking.Com,A week ago you contacted me to say that a change of ownership had caused a cancellation of my reservation. A shame since this was the Christmas present for my grandparents who were thrilled about the booked accommodation. Booking.com, however, informed me that I would get the money refunded within one day. I therefore swiftly booked a new hotel. Although you were quick to inform me about the cancellation, you now refuse to reply to my e-mails asking questions about why I still have NOT received my refund! This is not a small amount and the least you could do is to reply to my e-mail. I am truly afraid to ever use Booking.com after this experience, and hope I will get my money back asap!

1196	            I booked a room at the Astor Hotel in Athens on Bookings.com and almost immediately felt uneasy so I tried to cancel the next day.  I was told my reservation could not be canceled so I accepted that.  I arrived at the hotel and was informed the room as represented on the website did not have a view or a balcony but I could pay more to upgrade.  Although unhappy, I accepted that as well.  I asked to see both the room I reserved and an upgraded room with a view.  The hotel refused to show me anything until I filled out the registration. That was my first red flag.The room I was assigned was small, dark and dirty with only one small window with frosted glass.  I asked about it and the hotel employee opened the window to reveal a concrete wall.  I told him I would not stay in that room but was not offered any other choices except to upgrade and pay more money.  I decided not to see the higher priced room because the one they showed me was $245.00 US for two nights and I didn’t  want to pay more to stay in a dirty hotel.  I snapped a picture of the room and  window.Back in the equally dirty lobby I called Bookings.com and customer service tried to intervene on my behalf without success.  A room at the same price with a real window was never mentioned or offered.  I was in the lobby of the hotel for 45 minutes talking to bookings and looking for another hotel. In that time I was never offered a key or any solutions.  It was only as I was leaving to find another hotel that the manager who had been watching this unfold, attempted to talk to me and justify the room with the frosted window and concrete wall view.  After returning home, I disputed the charge with my bank and provided photographs of the room that was advertised on Bookings.com which was light filled with big windows and the room I was assigned with no proper window.  I was informed I would have to wait 90 days for a decision.I went to the Bookings.com website and attempted to write a review of the Astor Hotel but was not able to.  I contacted Bookings and they said the hotel marked me as a No Show and therefore I was not allowed to post a review and there was nothing they could do about it.  This, even though I called them while I was at the hotel , had paid for the room and registered. The hotel obviously knew how to work their system which is clearly designed to benefit hotels and censor  bad reviews. The best they could do was a $50.00 credit.Today I received a decision from Visa that the dispute was decided in favor of the hotel.  In the documents, there are conflicting statements by the hotel.  One with a reference date of October 3, 2017 (the day the reservation was made) that I was offered a different room at a higher price (True) and one dated October 20, 2017 that I wanted to be upgraded free of charge and when offered an alternative room to other rooms free of charge I refused. The October 20, statement is completely false. They also failed to mention the room only had one small, frosted glass window looking out to a concrete wall.  Still, Bookings wrote a letter in support of the hotel even though my entire experience was documented with them including photos that clearly show the room the hotel gave me had absolutely no resemblance to the room advertised on their website.   The definition of fraud is, “ deceit, trickery; specifically : intentional perversion of truth in order to induce another to part with something of value or to surrender a legal right.”  That sums up how I feel about my  experience with Bookings.com and the Astor Hotel in Athens Greece.  Never again.UPDATE 1/26/17: Bookings.com replied to this post on 1/12/17 asking me to direct message them.  I added an update per the Trustpilot guidelines asking for their contact information.  Bookings.com has not replied.  It appears they have a pattern of not following through.  So those nice responses you see on other complaints? It would be interesting to know if they didn't follow through on those either.UPDATE 1/14/17: Bookings.com, please provide me with an email address or contact name to send the requested information to.  All attempts to resolve this through normal customer service channels has been futile.  Thank you.        	                1	1	Friday	booking	negative

1198	            I have been using Booking.com since 2011, and qualify as a genius or frequent traveller as I have made over 70 bookings;  and up until the last 6 months I would have rated their service highly. Sadly, like many of the reviewers, their service has changed and twice in recent past I have been charged for bookings that were 'pay at property' options (the only way I ever book), and on both occasions it has been hassle to get the money refunded.  So two strikes and you are out, as far as I am concerned, so when this recent charge is refunded, I will stop using Booking.com, and advise others to think very carefully before using this service.It needs to be understood that the suppliers of the hotel services input their information and terms into the Booking.com system, however,  it can't be that 'one size fits all', as a consequence the Terms of Booking vary, and if you  don't read carefully the booking form pages then  you can end up with an immediate charge or pre authorisation you don't expect and only find out after confirmation - a matter I have taken up with Booking.com more than once in recent months - including writing to their CEO Gillian Tans.This is what has happened to me twice in recent months, the last time being December; yet I read the detail very carefully, and I only ever book using the option of 'pay at the property'  and I have  still been charged immediately.  The refund, needless to say takes forever, with form filling, and the customer service staff of course  implying  that it is my fault, and I made the mistake...which I haven't in either case.Booking.com does not check their suppliers details in their website, nor their terms of business, I doubt that the people in customer service even understand them.  The booking form us customers see doesn't necessarily reflect what will happen in practice. So in my view the Booking.com system is no longer fit for purpose.I used to recommend it to my friends (without the incentive they offer) however have now stopped, and I wouldn't recommend anyone use it.  Booking.com can no longer be trusted as far as I am concerned.IN REPLY TO THE BOOKING.COM RESPONSE, who seemed to have missed the point, it is still stressful because it is still a current problem.  If you had read my details I always review the hotels I stay in...I have given a lot of feedback, this however does not prevent monies being taken when it should not be taken. Either you have an option to Pay at the Property or you don't.  If your system does work on some and not others then you need to do something about the programming.  At the time of the recent incident I had booked 6 other hotels all in the same period of time, so why do 6 work on my option and 1 doesn't!Additionally I won't be reviewing this particular hotel that has given me a problem because I cancelled the booking and we don't get to review cancelled bookings...hence the problem with the refund, which still has not been repaid!So asking me to give feedback is a bit pointless...I have provided feedback here...will Booking.com take any notice - I doubt it.        	                7	2	Wednesday	booking	negative
1199	            Horrible customer service!! If I could give 0 stars I would. I booked a stay with them, and their confirmation states if you find a better rate with a competitor to fill out a claim online and they will refund the difference. It has to be the exact same room and terms. The day after I booked I found the price cheaper on booking.com AND Priceline. I filled out the claim as told and gave a link to the exact site, the confirmation email I received said they would get back to me in a few days. A week later I filled out a request for customer service (after checking priceline link was still working and still cheaper price). 10 days after my initial claim I received an email that the link I send it is not valid so they will not refund any money.  I went back and forth a few times and in the end only got an email saying due to their volume of emails it's best to call them to make sure it's handled. That's all great, but your site specifically said to file the claim online!!!!!        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	positive

On the second night he deliberately  locked us out (left his key in the lock) , we heard yellling and screaming from him, with crying children running around. On the third nght he threw us out without notice and refused to giive us our money back, because he lied to Booking.com and said the appartment was for 5 when it was only for 4 people .

The hotel was ready to refund the unused nights but then said because we booked through booking.com we had to contact them for a refund. I could find no way to contact them, no phone#, no email, their ""contact us"" page did not allow any contact. Virtually zero customer service.

1204	            I have been using Booking for years and I haven't had any problems...until now. They've sent a code to share with my friends in order to receive £15 each. Sounds like a good deal so I shared it with my friend and we booked a place together using the link provided by Booking.com but surprise, surprise they said that the link was never used and they refused to give us the money previously offered. I got in touch with its Customer Services and they are useless. They replied to my emails requesting information that it was already given and after more than 10 days (they say it takes 24h) waiting for a response I never got it. I had to call Customer Services and a very pretentious man denied me my right to complaint. Finally he agreed to raise a complaint and straight away he told me that it was a waste of time as they won't do anything about it...Very nice Booking... I won't use it again and I won't recommend it to anyone.Did I mention how pretentious and arrogant they are? I had to bookings coming up in January and it felt so good to cancel both of them and to delete the app.        	                5	1	Wednesday	booking	negative
1205	            Further to my last review... Booking.com have no complaints process.  The so called customer service department simply dismiss you.  There is nothing you can do about it.  Utterly shocking!!I showed them screen shots of were I was mislead and they simply referred me to contradictory terms and conditions.  Terms and conditions say I could be charged at any time on the card provided and yet on the main booking process it say the card is a ‘holding card’ and I can change the details.This is my honeymoon I had booked and all this has placed a sour taste.        	                61	1	Wednesday	booking	negative
1206	            Booked an apartment in central London and paid in full 4 months in advance.With just 7 weeks to go Booking.com contacted me to say the booking was cancelled.  No explanation.  No details about how it would be refunded.In reality the property is still available but has quadrupled their prices for the long weekend we were staying, and has simply decided to cash in on higher demand closer to the time!I phoned Booking.com and they weren't interested.  They promised to look into it and then just emailed me to say I had to provide them with proof of the payment being taken by the property before they would do anything about a refund.As for the property cancelling at short notice and not honouring the booking, Booking.com are not interested.  They will take NO action on the property.  Why?  Because it is the property who is paying them NOT guests.  So they are not interested in addressing the guests issues.They are NOT a booking agency, they take no responsibility and even unlike other platforms such as eBay or Amazon do police their advertisers or take any action against them for unreasonable behaviour.  And of course I can't leave feedback for the property who has treated me badly, because we didn't stay there!We're now left to find another property at short notice and it will cost us double what we paid originally to stay anywhere in London on those dates.        	                3	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

1208	            Avoid, avoid, avoid.  I used to use booking.com for all my holidays - until now !!  I booked a one night trip to York and received no confirmation or indication the booking had been accepted. I booked again, received one confirmation so as far as I was concerned I had one booking until 2 days before I went. I had mistakenly booked it twice because I did not receive the confirmation.  Up-shot is they charged me twice through no fault of my own.  I complained and they came back after over a week saying it was my fault.  Have a look on Tripadvisor there are lots of people who have been charged twice.  I will never use again        	                2	1	Monday	booking	negative
1209	            Some of the worst conduct and customer service I've ever come across.  I have used booking.com for numerous holidays and have not had any serious issues in the past, but when I have had a problem with a property, booking.com refuses to help.  In fact, they have just flat out ignored all contact and censored my review.  Now, I am out of pocket and have been totally ignored by the property and by booking.com.   I would avoid at all costs - if you are unlucky enough to find yourself in a position with a property that treats you unfairly, booking.com will not assist you at all and will ignore you completely.  Additionally, the reviews of properties are censored and screened so the public is not truly seeing fair and honest opinions of paying customers.        	                3	1	Monday	booking	negative

1211	            Do not touch Booking.Com. They conned me out of my holiday. I booked a family holiday at a good price seven months in advance and paid upfront. A week before we were due to leave I received an email from them saying that the cost had tripled ! Either I would have to pay the increase or they were going to cancel. I wrote back and tried to argue that you cannot just do that to people and instead of talking about it they just cancelled everything.They messed with our heads and ruined a family holiday with a few taps of a keyboard. NEVER NEVER trust Booking.Com. I have since discovered that they have treated many others in the same way. Booking.Com cannot be trusted. Do not give them money. Do not book through them. Above all do not trust them. In my experience they are cheats, liars and con artists. A thoroughly disgusting company that treats clients like dirt. Customers mean absolutely nothing to this company. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED by someone who did not heed the warnings of others. AVOID AT ALL COSTS OR YOU WILL PAY A HEAVY PRICE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. A nasty business that operates in a dirty low down fashion and treats customers with utter contempt. They care nothing for anyone but themselves. No honour, no trust, no integrity.Treat Booking.

1212	            Booking .com is wonderful when you take care of the following things :1. Check reviews of the place you will stay at2. Read full profile where you will stay3.

Then I wrote them and asked to try process payment again. They didn't reply to me, I just received email from their robot with instruction to wait contacting with me... It didn't happen. After some time I received message that my booking was cancelled. However I saw that there was not repeated attempt to process payment. They just cancelled my booking. I wasn't able to re-book the same property type because it already wasn't available. I called to their custom service and I heard strange reasons from them. When I asked why my email was ignored, they answered that was because of storm and they couldn't read emails...

The last straw for me was refusing to issue a refund when two 2 rooms were accidentally reserved despite me requesting one, truly appalling.  Simply use another comparison site or book directly with the hotel, they will always match or beat the booking.com price anyway.        	                5	1	Saturday	booking	negative

1216	"            Terrible. I hope anyone looking to use booking.com check out their reviews and feedback before using their website. I had the worst experience with a hotel using them. I emailed them explaining my experience and told them I have pictures etc as proof. They never bothered to get back in touch with me. Worse still, they wouldn't even give me the opportunity to write feedback or review the hotel I stayed with. It showed up as ""no show"" although I have proof of payment that I had stayed there 5 days.The thing is if there are just one or two bad reviews, you could be cynical, but booking.com have hundreds if not thousands of bad reviews, and thats something else altogether. DO NOT USE.====This bit is written after the booking.com reply. I gave your support team over a week to contact me. I reached out to them  to give them an opportunity to deal with the situation. The staff at the hotel lied to my face. I wasn't expecting a high quality of service from the hotel, I was expecting the very basics like a room that is ready and clean. If there is a fault you accept the fault and you apologise and you try and rectify it. The hotel staff just refuse to accept a problems when there was one. And thats just the tip of the iceberg. I only write reviews when I am extremely angry or happy. As a business owner I hate writing negative reviews because I know running a business is not easy. But one of the staff was rude aggressive, and there is never a need for this.        "	                7	1	Friday	booking	negative

When i looked back after i had chosen a few, I realised that one wasn't free to cancel, it was 27th December when i booked so obviously no one was at work at booking.com and all i could do was go through the app and send messages saying what had happened and how it was the searches fault and to please cancel.After a few days i got a reply on the messenger on the app which seems automated, you can't even reply you just have to keep clicking options until it lets you write something. After numerous messages they said they contacted the place and they said that they could not cancel it. No one replied saying they were sorry for the app being the reason for this, no one has said sorry at all. I kept replying to the app and it kept saying that they would contact the place but with the same reply about how there was no cancellation available.The money has since come out of my account, so two studios for 4 people which isnt cheap, and over xmas and new year which is the worst time for money to come out!

Certainly for myself it wasn’t a price issue or I would of used a premier inn or travel lodge. I clicked on the link after finding the perfect hotel that had been recommended by my boss, and proceeded to complete my booking.

1226	            I booked an apartment through them in August for an October stay for five. They then contacted me at the beginning of October to inform me the apartment listing was now closed and I could no longer stay there, but they offered to find another property for me, and explained they would pay the extra within reasonable limits. A hotel was sought and three double rooms were booked. They informed me to submit the invoices once I had stayed there, and they would then reimburse the difference. Now nearly three months later, they are arguing with him with regard to the amount. They now say that they will take the cleaning costs into account that I would have paid at the original apartment booking, and will only pay the remaining amount after the cleaning costs are deducted? words cannot explain my frustration at their penny pinching and misrepresentation in this matter. Never again will I book with them.        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	negative
1227	            Have used many times - their key USP I think is the 'results on one page' with great filters for 'parking', 'included breakfast' or 'free wi-fi' (all essentials!) plus an often useful 'free' cancellation policy.  This makes it be quite flexible which is really great when planning a trip with many stops. However 'free cancellation' can mean paying more when booking initially mind to get this option...The only other caveat is that they can take a fair commission from hoteliers so you may get a better deal by going direct.  They make great use of cookies too - so expect follow ups to prompt you to book after a tentative search!        	                18	4	Wednesday	booking	positive
1228	            Booking.com are absolutely useless when you have a problem with accommodation.  I and my family with grandchildren were left high and dry and out of pocket.   Accommodation was not as described and not safe on arrival! The owner took 50% payment 2weeks before arrival and then demanded we pay remaining 50% despite the accommodation being unsuitable and not as described.   Booking.com had no effective policy in place to protect me.  Just an expensive call and told to work it out with owner of accommodation. Useless!   It was Booking.com that had allowed the mis selling of this accommodation to be on THEIR website! I was left high and dry and separated from my family because we couldn’t afford for all to go elsewhere. I had to pay for safe and clean accommodation for grandchildren. Booking.com are simply commission grabbing middle business.  Useless! I will use Agoda from now on who simply ask for evidence of poor accommodation and refund your account.    Hence all accommodation owners are acceptable and honest!        	                2	1	Wednesday	booking	negative
1229	"            I used booking.com in several occasions without problems including Rome, London, Corfu, Metsovo. There are many alternative websites out there but you should beware. Choosing a good accommodation and especially a value for money depends on preferences and is not a simple task.In general it is a good suggestion to AVOID accommodations with lower than 10 reviews and lower than 8 rating. The more the reviews and comments, the better. You also have to read and balance the comments and especially replies.Pictures are usually misleading and are used like potato chip commercials. You always get less than what they advertise you!Moreover check carefully the cancellation policy and the local taxes paid on arrival. There are too many variations and you do not want surprises.On the other hand with booking.com you may be a good guide in order to find and contact the ""perfect"" accommodation directly. Then a better offer is possible but beware: In many cases and especially during low season the staff treats and handles booking.com customers better. Because of the reviews!As a verdict, I feel satisfied with the service.        "	                2	4	Wednesday	booking	positive

1231	"            I booked a non-existent room in Gran Canaria! Obvioucly we did not find this out until actually trying to reach the accommodation, when the owner told us he had a ""better"" place for us to stay...21 miles away from where we had booked.  Following significant problems I complained and then was told I should have checked the reviews after I had booked. Booking.com basically said it was my fault for not regularly checking comments (none of which were made prior to the booking). In addition, the low ratings that had been posted (shortly before our trip) were in Spanish and also suggested similar problems. So Booking.com is great for potential fraudsters to post non-existent rooms and tehn swap them for crumby accom when you have reached your destination. I will never use them again.

1236	"            THE KEY ISSUES ARE: INFORMATION PROVIDED ON BOOKING.COM's SITE IS DECEIVING AND THE BOOKING PROCESS IS VERY TRICKY.The first step I took was to book the hotel for one night and great that it offers free cancellation so that I have time to plan my trip. Then, I thought to myself that it is better to book one more night on the safe side so I changed the date to the 20th instead of 19th. After I received the confirmation email from Booking.com to my email, then I saw texts which clearly state that there is a cost to cancel the booking and ""Changing the dates of your stay is not possible."" I also read that the hotel is undergoing constructions works! Furthermore, under the Call-to-Action button ""I'll reserve"", the texts actually blink and I didn't see the words ""confirmation is immediate"".If you really have to use Booking.com, be VERY CAREFUL of hidden texts. I do not understand why Booking.com has to make it so complicated. One can tell the intention/motive. There is no case number after you spoke to customer service; thus no confidence of whether the details are recorded properly nor your complaint will be handled properly.The next thing from Booking.com will be some standard reply to customer's complaint as you can see in other posts.

I used my credit card to make the payment and the site told me that I can pay using my original local currency. Then I already received a confirmation email, telling me that no way to cancel the booking. I printed it out 2 copies of the confirmation email. Upon arrival at the hell/hotel, the RUDE manager told me to MAKE PAYMENT !!!!! I really surprised. I thought the manager did not understand me as he spoke not good English. Immediately showed him a confirmation email, he said this is not payment but reserving!!! and I MUST pay to get the room. This means I pay with a new exchange rate plus the credit card issuer will charge me extra for using foreign currency. After long argument with that RUDE manager, I decided to refuse the hotel and search for the new one.When I returned home, I contacted the CS but show a good careless.

Unfortunately on 16th afternoon my husband was hospitalized for a medical emergency and we were asked to not travel. Upon his discharge a couple of days later, we called to cancel all our bookings. EVERY SINGLE HOTEL and FLIGHT reimbursed us for life threatening emergency OTHER THAN THE RESERVATION for Harbor Grand Kowloon through booking.com!When we called the hotel, they asked us to call booking.com and submit an exception. We did that. The initial call was very courteous and the person asked us to send medical paperwork- which we did. We then received a standard email from booking.com claiming that Grand Kowloon denied our claim.At this point - I am extremely disappointed with booking.com and the hotel.They will take your money (&gt;$1000 for us)and don’t really give a crap even if you die. POOR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND ABSOLUTELY  INCONSIDERATE. Stay elsewhere if you are traveling from the US to HK and don't use booking.com.

It could not have been more clearer that Booking.com had our money in their account because BOOKING.COM was in captial letters  at the top of the receipt and unde that the amount that had gone into their bank account from my boyfriend’s account.This was their reply:Hi there and thanks for your message. In order for a proof of charge to be valid, it must  include ALL of the following: • Cardholder’s name • Bank logo • Last 4 digits of the credit card number• Merchant name (who the charge is from)• Transaction date, amount and currency We'd suggest to contact your bank and once you have your statement, email it to: customer serviceWithout the right criteria, our customer service won't be able to chase that up for you with the hotel.Regardless that they had the evidence 5ey still came back saying it wasn’t enough and requested the above information.I replied saying that this was proof enough and that i was disgusted that they had not even acknowledged how they had spoilt my birthday weekend and my marriage proposal - not even a mention of any of that.To this l got the following reply:Hi there, this inbox will now transition from social care support to a chatbot for new bookings. Our Customer Service team is available to help 24/7  - you can reach them on a link they gave me.and straight after l got this from them:Hi there, you have just received a notification that this inbox will switch to a Chatbot.

As part of our Christmas present from our families we booked an expensive hotel for one week through booking.com as it looked amazing and we thought we would have a microwave and toaster in our room so we could still eat cheap. We turned up, and the hotel had so many problems!! Building work going on, unprofessional staff sitting outside the ‘reception’ smoking and on their phones, a couple of monkeys caged up crying out constantly!!! And a awful disgusting smell coming from our bathroom which made it unbearable to use! The food was expensive but it was awful too which mean we would be expensive to get taxis every day to eat lunch and dinner.  Breakfast was included but you only had 2 options to choose from and it was absolutely ridiculous how they could of called it a breakfast. Booking.com falsely advertised on their website and I have contacted them 5 times with no reply.  At first they responded twice in one day and asked for photo evidence, and then as soon as I replied with full information I haven’t heard from them since! I have never had a problem before, but this has totally put me off using them again, I am gutted as it was £500 for a week nd we left after 2 days as I couldn’t bare to be there and then having to pay out for another hotel on top!

1261	            I have been using booking.com for years now, I would say it has been a smooth experience so far. But 90% of my bookings are done with the free cancellation option,  just in case, unless there is a big gap in price with the no cancel option charge.Their website is very good,  their android app could be improved a bit. It happened more than once when there were a few clarifications to be made (in relation to the hoteliers) and booking.com staff did those on my behalf...My only advice,  if I could give to booking.com,  would be to set a protocol on what kind of hotel photos are shown in the hotel description:  some are misleading (too good to be true) like showing the room from an angle where it looks much bigger than it really is, showing beautiful landscape  photos of the local city  which also tricks the customer into thinking/relating this to the venue etc...UPDATE:  some bookings provide a 'Free Cancellation' but sometimes this option is only until the following day! So you have to read carefully the details of the reservation to see Until When do you have the option to  cancel a booking...        	                16	5	Tuesday	booking	positive
1262	            I booked a serviced apartment at No1. Hagley Road in Birmingham through booking.com for two executive guests staying on business.  The apartment was let by Birmingham Serviced Apartments via Booking.com.  On arrival the apartment was dirty and in poor state of repair.  We liaised directly with the property but were offered only an alternative equally dirty apartment.  I then complained to Booking.com for a refund with full photographic evidence and have been told that my claim for a refund will not be upheld as the property say the apartment was clean.  The photographic evidence clearly shows pubic hair in the bed and the bathroom, ground on dirty food in the microwave, blood stains on the tiles and decoration around the apartment in poor condition.  Booking.com have not really attempted to resolve this issue with the property and I am now left with a large bill and dissatisfied business guests.

1263	            I made a reservation at Nature Lodge Finca Los Caballos back in September 17th and it had a FREE CANCELLATION. I cancelled by October 9th. To my surprised I realized in November that I was charged on Sept 17th, so I contacted booking and sent a claim. They got back and asked me for proof; I sent it and they asked me for more detailed information from the bank. I went back to the bank and got what they asked for and finally Booking.com said the hotel was going to process my refund! I has been almost another month and still nothing, every time I call they got me waiting on the line…a week and a half ago, they told me to wait until they contacted the lodge. Then, they said that they were not answering that they had to try again and that they will get back to me. They never did, so I called again today. The representative asked me to wait on the line because the resolving period was over their regular period to solve cases and she had to escalated it. Then she ask a few questions and finally she said that Booking.com was going to pay my money back and invoice the hotel, but that I needed to resend the back statement caused it looked like a receipt. I payed with my dad’s credit card and he resides in Costa Rica; unfortunately, their bank statements are not as nice as the ones in the states, so when you ask the bank for a bank statement that is the best proof they give. After telling this to the representative, I had to was again and this time to tell me that it was ok, but that I needed to send a better picture. I couldn’t believe it.Unfortunately, taking another picture is not as easy as it sounds. My dad is an old man and getting him to work with technology is a challenge. And okay ultimately I can do it, but it is just unbelievable how hard it has become to recover my money. Not only they made an unauthorized charge to my card because that is not what the agreement was, but they also got to acknowledge at some point that the lodge admitted the charge was made and that a refund was going to take place and even with that instead of offering me a solution, they just keep making excuses and making my experience more frustrating.        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	positive

When I called Booking.com Customer Services asking for a correct address they said the couldn’t give it to me!I have spent the past 2 weeks trying to get Booking.com to take action about a Fraudulent Advert and received no help from them whatsoever!Gary Risley        	                9	1	Monday	booking	positive
1265	            You can get the same price by calling the hotel, by quoting the price you find in booking.com homepage. Normally it works ok booking through the homepage, but if there is a problem with your booking or if you need to get things changed it is al to cumbersome to communicate via booking.com. If you don't believe it works with the process for booking above try yourselves. Booking.com don't add any value to the booking process-        	                8	2	Monday	booking	negative
1266	            I have used booking.com for many years now and I find them very good.  I have had only one issue, when I booked a hotel in the Virgin Islands and they took a pre-payment out on my card.  This was when the pound plunged against the dollar.  I cancelled the booking, but the hotel beat me to it.  Booking.com customer care were very helpful and I got my money back.  Other than that, my experience has always been a good one.  I can cancel bookings without issue.  I now have genius status, after 5 stays, but I think the genius reward program is not very good.  They offer either 10% discount, but usually only for the cheapest rooms.  They also offer free welcome drink, even when it is an all inclusive hotel.  That is kind of funny.  I have made use of the early/ late check in/out rewards, which are very handy.  I will continue to use them.  Its has really good information about the hotels.  Always read the reviews before booking.  I like that you can cancel for free up until the day before the booking, in most cases.  They do price match, but you have to let them know about the cheaper price within 24 hrs of booking.  They are a great company, so 5 stars from me.        	                6	5	Sunday	booking	positive

1269	            HiFurther to my review on trust pilot about booking .com, I had sent all the pictures to booking.com on November 5th. So why should I send it again?  I had written my reviews about this hotel in booking.com but you didn’t publish, stating I didn’t stay in this hotel. But booking.com is well aware that they have charged me without even staying there. Even though I didn’t stay there but charged the money for not staying in the hotel, then obviously I have the right to review this hotel, because I didn’t want someone else also going through the same problem.I had called your customer care dept today to discuss this, but your customer people are not interested  in this matter and disconnected the phone. This has happened many times to me while talking just disconnecting the phone. This is not the good customer service.SO BOOKING.COM SHOULD PUBLISH MY REVIEW WITH THE PICTURES. OTHERWISE I WILL BE GOING FOR LEGAL ACTIONS. ALSO FOR EVERYONE “AVOIDE BOOKING.COM THEY WON’T HELP YOU IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE HOTEL”.        	                11	1	Saturday	booking	neutral

Anyway kept checking the bank nothing rang the bank nothing received, rang booking .com back they told me it was refunded Friday morning 01.00 and will be 10-12 days CS were so unhelpful would not transfer me to a supervisor and basically said tuff they can't do anything .I'm devastated  just before Christmas and now getting charged OD fees too        	                2	1	Saturday	booking	negative

1272	            Really upset with booking.com. Booked hotel in May 2018 which was a non refundable room so knew I would pay for it at some point. However, was not aware of when it would be taken. No warning that it would be taken in november. No invoice or receipt, just found about it when I checked bank. The hotel has been so unhelpful too as I appealed for them to cancel the booking due to marital breakdown but they wouldn't even consider it. This was before any money was taken. I am now a single parent of 3 children and £130 out of pocket before Christmas. Never ever use this company.        	                1	1	Friday	booking	negative

1274	            The website is unbelievably flaky. It shows different rates to different people, and the policies are very questionable.

1276	            I have used booking.com over 10 times booking for family/friends but now I'm hesitant after my last experience.It's been months now and my friend did not receive the $40 off $80 that they offered on their own website. They also make you jump through massive hoops for price matching. I provided screenshots of the prices, the room types, hotel name, and website and they still asked for more information. I'm not sure what else more I could have given them so I just gave up. What they could have simply verified themselves after all the information provided. They try to inconvenience you as much as possible to not provide the price match. Probably won't use the website again, unless there is another promotion and again it's a 50/50 chance they will actually provide you with itEdit: After this review and reply I contacted booking.com and they completely ignored my emails.

1278	            I booked a hotel thru booking in NYC to take my family.  Upon getting to the hotel, I was told the reservation had been canceled by Booking.com.  After I had received several emails from booking.com confirming my travel.  The hotel was booked and my family was in NYC with no hotel.  To their credit, booking did find us a similar hotel, and covered the difference of $80 in price.  However, they did not offer to help find us a way to the new hotel, or to cover that cost.  After dealing with the whole situation all night, we basically lot a night of our vacation.  I appreciate them covering the difference in the cost of the hotel, but I feel they should have stepped up more and offered a little more due to a wasted night of vacation and the trouble it caused my family.

1285	"            Booked a car at Copenhagen airport.  Info on Booking.com states 'Inside terminal 2'.  Tried to change time by 4 hours due to flight time change by Ryanair.  According to Bookings.com this can only be done through the 'provider'.  According to the Provider, this could only be done through Booking.com.  Went round that loop a few times (having to wait at least 48 hours each time for replies) before I got bored and cancelled the booking.Stupidly, I decided to re-book another car wit Booking.com at the new time.  The website still stated ""inside Terminal 2"".  This was important to me as we were travelling with a toddler and all the luggage that involves arriving at 8pm.On arrival, we followed the booking.com directions to the car hire desk, only to be told that all car hire was moved ""off site"" 10 months ago.  We were directed through Terminal 3, across a car park, round a building, across a dual carriageway where we waited for 45 minutes in sub-zero temperature before the courtesy bus arrived to take us approx 1km from the airport.I have complained to Booking.com who said they will investigate with the provider and get back to me.

The other issue I had was that Booking.com don't tell you there are three standards of double room - the lowest, which wouldn't have worked, came out at £110 for two nights inc. breakfast.        	                7	2	Sunday	booking	positive
1288	            This company have too many hidden costs at the time of booking. If a property adds fees such as cleaning then it should add it to the final price. All properties have their own policies so nothing is straight forward. I also used the recommend a friend scheme for a £15 reward. My friend booked, paid and completed their stay and guess what I received! £0 that's right, I nor my friend received an award. It's a total scam to increase sales. I will be forwarding a complaint onto the Financial Ombudsmen reporting Booking.com for this.

Even though I have screenshots of my booking showing pay at hotel. The same deal is available in their website. The customer service is shocking. I will never use again, and successfully cancelled 2 trips I booked with them for next year. Stay away at all costs. They are great until you actually need help. At which point they don’t care and are not helpful. I don’t care if it’s up to the hotel to agree a refund. You organised my booking.

1291	            I advise everyone to not use booking.com, worst experience ever!! My birthday weekend was ruined, their cancellation policies suck! I lost the entire amount of money I had paid for the stay because of an accidental cancel, not only were they not able to re-book it for me, they would not even refund, meaning I would have to pay another 250 for the place! I should have listen to the reviews telling me to not use this. So please listen to my review and use airbnb, which I used to book my next stay and it is so amazing, cancellations are fair and back and forth private messagings with the place you are staying at makes it even easier for all your questions to be answered within less than an hour, or even in 10 minutes. Great communication, the prices are fair aswell.  I am a student I don't have money to waste, I am happy to say I will not be using booking.com again ever! Also their help line was not great at all, I called them about my issue and they said they could not do anything and that they would email me any details they get but haven't even heard from them since!

1293	            On the whole I have had a reasonable experience but the site simply does not tell you properly about deposits charged to your credit card for hotels with a free cancellation policy. Furthermore with exchange rates and foreign currency fees you are never going to get the promised full refund. Again booking.com doesn't explain this at all. So you end up paying for a hotel with a 'free' cancellation policy. Whats more booking.com never answers messages sent to them which is distinctly shoddy. In response to booking.com's reply below - the charges are NOT properly displayed and in my experience booking.com NEVER answers messages sent to them. Furthermore if the hotel doesn't refund your deposit booking.com fobs you with telling you to contact the hotel (i.e. make an expensive international  call) when its actually booking.com's responsibility as agent.        	                5	3	Wednesday	booking	positive
1294	            I reserved a holiday which was advertised as nothing to pay now and pay at the hotel directly.  Clicking on the fine print didn't advise of any charges to be made.  It wasn't until I got the confirmation email that I was advised I had been charged 50% of the bill.  This was a refundable holiday which I cancelled as soon as I read the email after my husband found out his card was charged a few days later.  It's been like pulling teeth to get a confirmation of the refund which they have told me for over a week had been processed only to find when I pushed for proof that it had only been done today.  I wish I had read the reviews here before using them and made the mistake of trusting a well known brand.

Since then I have reserved rooms again. Only to find out my credit card was charged for the first Room. When contacting them it took them 15 min to Evan find the original reservation, then denying the cancellation, asking who I spoke with. As a Christian person guess learned don't trust people. Several people have shared similar experiences. Lesson learned...book direct.

1301	            I used Booking.com for at least a decade on dozens of occasions and it was always great. Until this year. The hotel rates are not transparant anymore, with often taxes not included. All their focus is on money grabbing, both from guests and hotels. Their website has become a mess, with lots of useless 'information', just trying to seduce you to book with them. Customer satisfaction is not their first priority anymore. Prices are almost always the highest from all hotel websites, despite the (fake) lowest rate guarantee. And finally their assortment of hotels is going down rapidly, with many hotels not being available, assumingly because their commission for the hotel is insanely high. All in all; they have become very arrogant after their initial success.        	                3	2	Monday	booking	positive

1307	"            I'd say to avoid Booking.com like the plague, but at least with the plague you'd get results.I have used many online services before, some good, some bad...but booking.com takes inadequacy to the next level. From start to finish, their incompetence has been unparalleled and their apathy for customers clear.There are a plethora of issues with booking.com, so I'll attempt to break down each and every one of the faults into shorter paragraphs to make the reading easier for you (a courtesy they did not provide me).1. The initial bookingBooking.com's website layout seems to defy logic. You can search for a hotel within 2 miles of the city center, and find yourself looking at hotels some 20 miles away and regularly checking google maps for addresses. Even then, when you try and filter based on ratings/reviews, they'll find a way to sneak other hotels into the lists.2. The purchaseWe use a credit card for purchases to provide an extra level of safety when making large transactions online. This is all that this card is used for and the sum is always replenished. Therefore, it came as a shock when our payment was rejected 3 times initially by booking.com, for customer services to inform me that ""they were experiencing issues"". Eventually, we managed to make this payment, but was that the end? What do you think?One week before we were due to go on our long-awaited holiday, we get a standard email from booking stating our reservation had been cancelled due to a failed payment. Of course, we fixed the situation once more (apparently booking.com tried to move some money between accounts and we fell foul of this). Then, once more, the same issue happened 2 days before we flew out. This didn't exactly put our minds at ease. Booking.com's response this time? That we pay on site at the hotel itself. Talk about relaxing and calming!3. The day of travelSo, you're packed, passport in hand and heading to the airport. What drama could happen now?How about the hotel calls you (on behalf of booking.com, because they didn't want to call) to inform you that ""a pipe had burst in your room"", a likely story. So, the hotel decides to place you into a 'sister hotel' down the road, and this is all above board with booking. The new hotel, which we had not or could not see on the booking.com website or read reviews about was ""a much better hotel"" according to staff, despite the room appearing to be downgraded. A hotel who's address is ""next to a post office"", I kid you not. That's fun to tell a taxi driver at the airport.Well, our flight lands at 3am local time, so there isn't much we could do about this situation apart from grin and bear it.We get to the hotel, and we enquire about the downgraded room. The reception staff brush this off and simply state ""this is the best room we have available"".I'm on holiday, it is 3am, I've spent 12 hours travelling. I just want to sleep, so we pay for the room and that's that. The next morning, after noticing that the room lacked even the basic facilities (an iron, sealed windows, a non-smoking room?) and the view was that of a construction site (where building work starts at 7am), I complained again to the front desk who once more brushed it off. The hotel itself was a lower standard than the original hotel (despite the same 4-star rating) and obviously wasn't the most welcoming of places. But I'll save the hotel review for another place.So, I set about and try to make the most of a bad situation; I am trying to enjoy this holiday after-all.4. HomecomingNow this is where booking.com lost all credibility; yes, at this point, I still thought they were somewhat competent.We get back home, and check the credit card statement. We'd been massively overcharged with the hotel. Now, I know that I am protected on this through a contract with booking.com, so I set about the task of getting the difference refunded.The first call happens, they have a look and the call center staff need me to tell this story 4 times. Apparently, they can't figure out that there is a difference in price on the first 3 occasions.Eventually, we get there and they say they will investigate and call me back.I got an email from them. One standard email, asking for the bank details showing the cost we paid. Duly sent.3 days go by, and I hear nothing, so I call again. Oh, they got my email, but were doing some ""calculations"" to work it out. Surely this is New Hotel Cost - Old Hotel Cost = Difference? But, we go through the story again, and once more, I am promised a call back. I didn't get that.We get an email instead, the next day, with a paltry amount on it. No explanation, just a basic email asking me to accept. So, I call again and wait an hour for them to come up with the calculation and reasoning. 10% charge here, tax fee there...I accept the calculation because quite frankly, it is tiresome.5. Booking.com skirt around the rulesSo, you're probably wondering right now, why I gave a 1 star rating? Yes, they messed up my payment, hotel, charged a wrong amount and the customer service was reliant on my own persistence. But does that entail this scathing review, a 1 star rating, and the like?Well, we still have the issue of the hotel quality.When I booked the hotel, I paid extra for a higher standard of room, which I did not receive. So, I went to booking.com to see what could be done in this regard. They said they'd check with the hotel for me. Better to have the big company fighting your battle than one individual? Wrong.The hotel, as expected, brushed off this complaint. The manager at the original hotel had no knowledge of my complaint and both hotels refused to explain themselves for the room downgrade, or the hotel change. Booking just took this in their stride and informed me that the hotel would not compensate me for the issue THEY caused; no point trying with them anymore. Luckily, booking said they'd conduct a 'thorough' investigation to see what they could do. 20 minutes later, I get another standard email from booking stating that there was nothing they could do. The hotel had refused compensation, and that was that. Booking are not responsible for the hotels, booking are not responsible for room quality etc. etc. ad infinitum.Their advice? Take it up with the hotel itself, a hotel which had already refused to budge and is based half way around the world.So, this leads me to the conclusion that booking.com do not care about customers. After all, they get paid by the hotels and not by us, why should they care? Their customer service is a joke, although the staff actually laugh at you on the phone, refuse to hand you to management when requested and make promises they obviously don't keep. They'd rather send you a standard email to avoid any contact with you, and act so unprofessional that you start questioning your own sanity when you do call them.They leak your information to hotels who can state they're acting on behalf of booking.com, move you into a worse hotel, with a worse room, and not bother with any complaints. This is all above board apparently.If you try and go to booking.com to complain, they put their fingers in their ears, hum loudly and explain there is nothing they can do. You'd be better of spending your time screaming into the wind.Thanks booking.com, you ruined my holiday, caused me a lot of stress following my holiday, and have certainly lost a customer.Tl;DR: If you want a good holiday, in the hotel/room you booked and want some sense of security, go elsewhere.In response to booking.com's reply:It is clear you haven't read the full review. My issue largely relies with the lack of consideration customer service shows. You took no action against a hotel which has not only made false claims, pretended to speak on behalf of booking and moved guests around as if they were pawns in some chess game, but have instead aimed to distance yourself. The least you could have done is shown to take some action, but you'd rather keep a hotel with shady practices on your website in order to trick more 'customers' than show at least the slightest empathy and remorse for my situation.

1308	            My company had booked a hotel room in London for an anerversiry trip with my girl friend. The day before we should leave I got an SMS stating that the credit card had not been accepted and should be updated. Our travel office updated the credit card and I watched as no error message was presented on the web page.While in flight for London my phone received another SMS with the same text. The hotel also tried to call shortly after, but being at 10.000 miles I was unable to receive the message.When arriving at the hotel at around 10pm, we were told that the booking had been canceled due to the credit card issue and the hotel was full.Well, thanks! Here we tried to do everything correct and it failed anyway! It seems that booking.com did not check if they could use the credit card when we submitted it. They just kept the numbers lying around for 4 weeks and did not check them until the last minute. When updating them no check was performed on the website. This is very basic and every tiny webshop have figured out how to do this.There have been a lot of money on the Master Card the whole time, we are pretty sure every number is entered correctly - both times. We still don't know what was wrong.The story ended good, because the Hotel paied a taxi to another hotel and gave us free breakfast. But that was not thanks to booking.com.        	                8	1	Thursday	booking	positive

1311	"            I had a very bad experience with them just now, I had firmly booked a place months ago for a christmas holiday and now I just got a nonchalant email saying ""oh sorry, we had an issue and sorry the place is no longer available"" which we had firmly reserved. We had an email the week prior that WE can't get out from now on and are liable for all the fees from the date onwards. This clearly doesn't apply to them - the company who couldn't care less about peoples' valuable annual leave and money for a holiday. They then said they would find us a replacement, but all is booked. They got us nothing comparable and in any case we would have had to pay more for something we didn't really like.  You also have to pay upfront if this happens and try claim back which is not ideal. Our initial booking price was half as much as they wanted to charge us now - where are we supposed to get this money from suddenly. It is appalling and I would give it no star or one star barring the customer service people I dealt with on the phone. Everyone was lovely and tried to help. They are to be congratulated at how good they are with their customers despite their constraints. However, we still didn't get a booking which is the main problem...

I'm beyond upset, and am sending proof to my bank for a chargeback. Tried to contact Booking.com, and have just been guided to a messenger bot!!        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	positive

I've booked 2 trips through this site in the past 3 months and both times I had terrible issues. Booking.com had the wrong check-in information for the first hotel which caused me to find another hotel on my first night in another country (France), at a place I don't speak the native language. The 2nd hotel I booked for a place in Italy, I paid for a place with personal shower and 2 beds. I got a room with shared communal shower and 1 large bed. In addition, my flight got delayed and I arrived at the hotel 2 hours later than expected. When I realized the flight would be delayed, I called the hotel right away and left them a message that I'd be 2 hours late. I arrived to the hotel to find no one at the front desk, everything closed. I called Booking.com for help (after searching for at least 15 minutes on their website for their international help number), only to find the worker tell me that for this specific hotel, late arrivals are not accepted. I asked where on their site does it display this information? The worker told me ""Only Booking.com staff have this information. It isn't shared with the public."" I was so outraged and confused as to why they would keep this information from their customers. Booking.com helps you find cheap hotels but I would not expect a pleasant trip.

1326	            This was terrible user experience. Booking.com showed €265 was the room rate. The hotel then used an exorbitant exchange rate to convert it into their local currency of 85,104 (why didn't Booking.com display the amount in local currency to begin with!!??) to charge me €273.75. Now I've wasted 3 days emailing and calling back and forth with both you and the hotel. For me this is about transparency - you showed one amount and charged another amount and the reason you and the hotel gave are not sufficient because why would they display a lower EUR amount than in their local currency. It doesn't make any sense at all. Plus if you look at the exchange rate during those days, it was only between 311 to 313. The difference is minimal and normally I would just forget it but it just goes to show what a terrible user experience this is and I would not book with either this hotel nor your website again.        	                3	1	Tuesday	booking	negative
1327	            I have no way of responding to their response so here's my follow up.Booking.com may have a secure server but that means nothing considering they give your credit card information directly to the hosts (who, by the way, are not vetted. Pretty much anyone can list their property on booking.com). I phoned booking.com after getting an email from them saying that if I didn't provide them with a current credit card, my booking was not guaranteed. I called them because it was unclear to me whether or not my booking was incomplete and ergo I would not be charged a cancellation fee, or if it was viewed as a cancellation. If it was the latter I was going to try to see if the hotel would accept cash as if I was going to be charged for a booking I may as well use it. I called and was assured that my booking was not complete and I would not be charged if I didn't provide them with a current credit card. I knew I had funds arriving to that card later that night, but after the 3 hour deadline was given to me by booking.com.I was clearly told I did not have to do anything, my booking would not be completed and I would not be charged. I have a phone log of when and who I called.So thinking I had no way to fullfull that booking I found a hotel that accepted cash. I also had a funny feeling and REMOVED my card from booking.com's website. The next day I found out, oops too late! Even though I removed my card from their site BEFORE the money arrived on my card, they had ALREADY given my 'secure' credit card information for an incomplete booking to the hotel who then decided to charge me for both nights anyway. OF COURSE if booking.com said I would be charged anyway I would have contacted the hotel to see if I could make alternate payment arraingements instead of paying for two hotels.Well booking.com accepted they told me this when I called, but after promising to call me back to let me know so I could at least stay the second night at the hotel I was already charged for, simply sent an email at some random time later saying the hotel refused to give my money back and that's that.So, don't believe their lies in the response. Do NOT trust them with your credit card and if they deny they give your 'secure' credit card information to third parties they are also lying.My bank will reverse the charges for this obvious scam but it ruined our whole time in Barcelona as we're on a budget. So eat a duck, Booking.com, I'm not wasting any more time being lied to by your representatives and am writing this from the AirBnB I am staying at.

1331	            To start with an honest remark: Booking.com has many good hotels. The problem is that it has become sloppy towards there clients and business partners. In a few years ago, a real person would deal with problems as they occurred until it was solved. Nowadays, the company works with call center employees who cannot follow up on a problem personally. There is no one to take responsibility. The whole operation is now geared towards making as much money as fast as possible, excepting that here and there there will be disappointed customers. The pas three weeks we have met so many problems with no help from Booking.com whatsoever, that I'm done with them. I am prepared to pay more for better service. In future, I will use Booking.com only to find fine hotels and then book directly or through a competitor.

1333	            I have used booking .com a few times with no problems and found some great value rooms too.However, it only takes one bad experience to change my opinion permanently.  I hate being ripped off, as I'm guessing most people do.Recently I used booking.com to book the Best Western Skylane Hotel near Gatwick Airport in the UK.I booked a  triple room with 8 days free parking, for an incredible price of £91.  So good I told all my friends.BUT!!!  On arrival at the hotel, we were met by a foreign guy manning the night desk, who could hardly speak a word of English.  He was extremely difficult to understand and he found it difficult to understand me.  I got the impression he was trying to charge me extra for the parking, but no amount of trying to explain to him worked.  I left it until the following day, when I spoke to a young woman, who also told me that I needed to pay extra for the parking.  I was furious and so in the end logged into booking.com and showed her the exact same deal for the following night.  She refused to back down and said that booking.com had made a mistake.My attempts to contact booking.com have met with absolutely zero response over the last month, so to prevent others from making the same mistake, I am now writing a review of my experiences at this dreadful hotel in as many places as possible.No one rips me off and gets away with it.  You've been warned.  Be very careful when using booking.com.  If it looks like a good deal, you may get your fingers burned later.        	                10	1	Sunday	booking	negative

1345	            PRICE AND FRIENDLY STAFF.My family and I stayed twice last October 2017.  Captain Alex and team were extremely accommodating, friendly and  helpful.  They made us feel welcomed and treated us like a member of their families.  Very clean big room and loved our breakfast. They have helped us organised our tour with discounts, how good was that !I highly recommend Dad's Bayview to anyone who is planning to make a trip to PPS, very much worth every cent.  Massive thank you guys. Alexes, I will certainly be in touch.  Cheers mate.  Remy-  Melbourne        	                1	5	Monday	booking	positive
1346	            Had an awful experience booking through this company - my original apartment was misrepresented, and then when I changed I found out too late that my cancellation had not gone through. I was charged the full amount for 5 nights stay even though the apartment could have been resold.Booking.com made no effort to try and assist me - both the apartment company and booking.com passed me between each other, neither accepting responsibility.I understand that I might have had to pay for the first night - but they charged me the whole lot (over £500!) and clearly had no interest in trying to resolve or help with the issue.        	                6	1	Monday	booking	positive

You state in your terms and conditions that no details are passed on at all, You state that the 3rd party would be dealing with the payments but you gave my personal information which is against the law and you lied about doing.If you read this and go ahead with giving Booking.com your personal details then like me you will have money stolen from your account i have tried to warn you but its up to you..Never again Booking.com your are THIEVES AND LIARS.........        	                5	1	Monday	booking	negative

NO they just ignore you and when they finally get back give you a short, sharp reply and basically saying nothing to do with your complaint.  Utterly disgusting service, I'm appalled!! Say they are available 24/7, another LIE!!! 4 days it's taken for a reply and nothing! Over 20 emails and phone calls and basically ignoring me. Even on my other review asking me to go to Facebook to message them they took 2 days to reply!! I cannot believe they operate this way. I will be telling everyone I know and come in contact with to avoid them. Incompetent, lazy, pathetic, clueless company. If you're reading this review DO NOT USE THEM!

1350	"            I have been using booking.com for quite some time, I will never be using again we booked the Danelis in Crete through them, now we know it wasn't going to be the Ritz but we did expect to get what was sold to us, what we got was no hot water and having to wash with bowls of hot water boiled from a kettle, beds with a mattress no thicker than 4"" uncomfortable to say the least, it was meant to be self catering no toaster as stated and only one knob on the 2 ring hob, it said there was satellite tv hahaha what a joke an old heavy backed portable tv with 4 channels only 1 watchable was bbc news Yay!! A shower cubicle that was disgusting and a toilet seat that wasn't on properly, we got told if we got sun cream on the sheets/towels we had to pay 10 euro for new ones, had to ask for towels to be changed on day 3 as they were wet through we complained every day to no avail on the 4th day it was too much so it was either go home or find somewhere else to stay which we did and 400 euros later, owner of the hotel wasn't there for us to check out so was phoned to which he said leave keys at reception never asked for an explanation, since coming home I have complained to booking.com who don't seem to give a dam and has taken the hotels side of events. Disappointed to say the least their customer service skills are shocking I was never able to speak to a manager, oh they offered me 25 euro as compensation what an insult when it already has cost me 420euro and an extra 400 plus I have received today my phone bill for all the calls to them and then putting me on hold for god knows how long which is £86 Not happy, you need to sort this booking.com it's a disgrace.

1351	            Long time a fateful costumer of Booking.com but just realised how terrible under appreciated costumers are when things goes wrong. We have booked a London 3*hotel and choosed a specific room type for our need. On our arrivals the room was unavailable and they placed us (couple in their 60s) in a mouldy-dump and dirty basement room with no heating. We stayed one night as we arrived at 1am but because they refused to give us different room we forced to go to another hotel same 3* similar price, strangely similar rating but like a 5* after a hostel how we felt. I have sent a complain letter to Booking.com as they sold a room type what was not available and there was no information or warning about the basement room in a unacceptable condition. I honestly believed that Booking.com would willing to help us to get money back but they not just refused but the whole tone of the reply letter from the costumer care was shocking. Booking.com selling a product and they should have a responsible attitude towards the costumers alike eBay /Amazon or any other website which selling a product. I think legal action and proper investigation will be placed soon as this is a unacceptable and clearly a unresponsive company attitude. As I see other reviews of Booking.com 2* out of 5* I wouldn’t be surprised if there will be a big scandal and legal action will happen in the near future. From now on we are going to liaise directly with the hotels as we just found out that you as a paying costumer have more rights if thinks goas bad. Anyway now they even cheaper as Booking.com charging hotels big big money!        	                3	1	Friday	booking	negative

1353	            For over 20 years I have been making reservations for hotels online. I made a reservation for two rooms at Ramada hotel w/booking.com in October. This reservation was a gift for my mom’s 60th bday. When my family arrived to the hotel they had to wait two hrs for the rooms because the hotel didn’t match the number of guest as I originally made the reservation for. Although I was correct. I placed this special order very carefully. After contacting, calling back&amp;fourth to booking.com to correct that so my family could finally get their rooms, booking.com representative told me that I need to pay $100 extra. The representative promised me that it will come out of my credit card because it was a gift from me and I did not want my mom to pay.  I agreed only because my family was still waiting at the lobby. When my family checked out the hotel charged my mom specifically extra $180. I was extremely upset. I have been contacting Booking.com for over 3 wks by now, literally  calling them on daily basis. Each time I had to speak to a different representative at booking.com who promise to resolve this issue and call me back. No one ever did. No one called me back. I finally called yesterday and a new representative(of course!) simply told me that there is nothing Booking.com can do. For over 3 wks I have been fighting this issue, stopping work in order to talk to someone from booking.com, and after all this they didn’t even try to help me. Extremely rude. I’m never going to book a hotel at Booking.com. I’m absolutely disappointed! They ruined my mom’s bday by charging her by surprise extra money. And chose to ignore me completely when it was time to try&amp;help me.        	                1	1	Thursday	booking	neutral
1354	            One star is too generous. Mislead into booking a room which appeared to be book now and pay at property to have money taken from my account. Quickly found this not only be one charge but two in error. Trying to get a refund for the double charge was very difficult, having to prove the charges along with numerous other requirements only to find I would then need to wait further for the hotel to respond. All in all took two weeks and at the end of the month left me with no money with two unexpected payments leaving my account. Very dissatisfied with the response from booking.com and had to chase countless amounts of times and waste a significant amount of time calling them every time.I may have just been unfortunate but regardless lu feel mislead, mistreated and uncompensated for what turned out to be a stressful ordeal for something I have never had issues with elsewhere.Will never use booking.com or IBIS hotels again        	                3	1	Thursday	booking	negative

1357	"            Oh My goodness. Booking.com are indeed a big fat booking con! Please do not make a mistake by using them, and I only hope that most of you read reviews before doing so!!!Its a shame as they never used to be so so so bad at..well everything!2 times in a row they took money/or allowed a hotel to take money from my account without my permission or knowledge. They had done the same to my sister 3 weeks prior unfortunately I only found this out afterwards. The first time, I thought it was probably my error, maybe I had overlooked a tiny section of writing somewhere. So the second time I was extra careful. For both occasions the T&amp;C's stated no payment was due until the date I arrive, however there is a fee up to 48 hrs before arrival if I cancelled. On both occasions I contacted booking.com for assistance to obtain my refund and to subsequently cancel the bookings as I felt so disgusted with the use of my bank card. And alas, they would not help me. I was met time after time with standardized automatic responses.I still haven't received my refund for the latest theft, and I have had to take this to the fraud department with my bank who are taking this further. The second time I checked all terms and conditions very very carefully before booking, and it didn't state anywhere, that any type of payment would be taken or held. And I tested it again by beginning a ""fake"" reservation just to be 100% sure and nothing came up to advise my card would be used to take any type of payment now. But, they did! In fact they took more than 50% of the final stay price!! However, once I initiated the complaint I was directed to a link which conveniently then had a section of Q's and A's - not included in initial booking before submitting my card info. Who is going to charge my credit card, and when?No prepayment is required for your booking.The property has the right to verify your credit card, and may hold an amount temporarily or until after check-out. This process depends on the property you book with, so it's best to contact them for any charging queries.I am really disappointed and let down by this service. Booking.com used to be a good service, cheaper rates and stuck to the terms clearly stated. Now, they provide no customer service at all, allow your entire banking information to be forwarded directly to hotels without your permission. I will not be using them again.

Booking.com asked for proof that the money had been taken by the hotel I booked and proof of what had been paid at the alternative accommodation but despite providing this information, booking.com has still not refunded my money.

1361	            Be careful They state no charges on credit cards and no hidden fees I booked a hotel for myself and eight others then I cancelled the hotel on the free cancellation fee. I got charged a international bank fee a large amount even though I paid in sterling. The reciet conformation was in sterling but they change it to euro then you get Bank charges. Not happy at all so be aware of this as really it should state cost of euro then cost in sterling then Bank charge. I would not use this company again. Then when they refund you you don’t get back full amount as the exchange rate they say had changed. Very disappointed so be aware of there traps.I now have got got a refund of exchange rate difference but not on the bank chargesI’m sorry but I spoke to your department today the 7th November and the girl I spoke to even admitted I was right in what I said but she couldn’t help me. I even asked to speak to a manager and was told I could not speak to one as she had already spoke to him. I believe during that conversation I had asked to speak to the manager 3 times and the reply was no. If you would like to call me that is fine and I’ll discuss it with you. I have accepted the refund of exchange rate12 euro but still disappointed of the calls today. In my eyes it is miss leading it should be made more aware.

1363	            Booked Lough Erne Resort through trip advisor, looked like it was free cancellation until the 15th December. When I read the  property description it looked slightly different to the details that I had read about previously. Phoned the hotel number only to discover it was a third party operator and that the cottage I had booked does not even belong to the Lough Erne Resort. Booking .com site says that my cancellation charges are the entire cost which is nearly £800 despite the booking only being made an hour ago and the trade description totally  misleading. It does not state anywhere that this property is not part of the Lough Erne Resort - I think trip advisor is also at fault for forwarding booking for Lough ‘Erne Resort to booking.com when it is not the same property.

1365	"            Absolutely shocking experience with booking.com.Had to cancel my trip abroad (with plenty notice) as my mother was diagnosed with aggressive bowel cancer and I needed to stay at home to care for her after surgery. Unfortunately her surgery was scheduled for the first day of my trip, so I had no option but to cancel.Anyway, I notified booking.com of this well in advance (just over 1 month) via email to see what they could do. They refused to cancel the booking with a refund, which I felt was a little heartless considering everything going on, but understood that this was the terms of the booking (it was classed as ""non-refundable""). However, booking.com did agree that if the hotel could re-let the rooms for the dates I was staying then I wouldn't be charged. Perfect you'd think - over a month in a popular tourist destination, they'll re-let them no problem!Here's where the trouble begins....Due to a total and utter failure &amp; breakdown of communication on booking.com's part, the hotel were never informed to cancel the rooms and re-let them. I even specifically have it in writing from booking.com that this had happened, and yet it never did.Only 3 days before I go, when I call to ask if they've been re-let, they tell me ""You didn't give us permission to cancel the booking"", DESPITE ME HAVING IT IN WRITING OTHERWISE! They consistently tried to tell me on the phone that this was my fault, even though the email they sent specifically says the hotel will try to re-book them. In the end the hotel only had 3 days to re-let the room, which was obviously never going to happen at such short notice. Booking.com are refusing to take any responsibility for this and instead insist it is my fault - despite having written evidence that they didn't do what they said they would.The room wasn't re-let and now I'm left almost £400 out of pocket. Just what I didn't need after having to leave work to care for my seriously ill mother.I've never been so frustrated, disappointed or upset with how a company has handled an issue before. No empathy, no understanding, a total refusal to accept blame (despite written evidence) and trying to tell me it's my fault. Avoid at all costs, I would never, ever go anywhere near them again.**UPDATE**: Customer Service rep got back to me via email, claiming that they had ""informed me of the re-booking confusion immediately after finding out"" - this is FALSE. I only found out when I called myself to see what the progress was, and they told me nothing had been done.Let's wait and see what other lies they try and come up with to pass the blame around more.

1367	"            I have re-rated this review to three stars as an excellent representative from the Genius team was able to sort the situation out. In general, Booking.com provides a reasonable service, however this particular experience - although eventually resolved completely - was a little bit sour.I was looking for a last-minute 2 night stay in Leeds, UK, and ended up being presented (at the very top of my list) with an 'apartment' style of accomodation that had been heavily discounted (70%) from its ""standard"" price. The cost seemed reasonable and completely in line with a number of other hotels and accomodation in the area for that time. I went through the entire booking process only to find that the eventual cost ended up to be two and a half times what was quoted on the initial ""Price for 2 nights"" page as the accomodation had added a very, very hefty nightly service charge (equivalent to more than the rate that I had been quoted for each night of accomodation) AND a cleaning fee. I only discovered this AFTER payment was taken. As it turns out, the accomodation hadn't correctly added the service charges in to the Booking.com system and hence the price ended up being way, way different to that which was originally quoted.Although this was resolved, this is meant to be a comparison site. Having a price listed for accomodation and then failing to quote the entire cost of the property makes it far more difficult to do a like-for-like cost comparison.

1368	            AVOID AVOID AVOID!!! I booked a room in July  at the Ibis hotel in Manchester for me and a friend for 1 night for the Utd game in January. Before I booked it clearly stated FREE cancellation and payment not due until arrival, all good. In October I booked a second room for another friend who decided to join us under the exact same terms as the first booking. 1 month on and utd postpone the match by 2 days, I tried to move the booking but no rooms were available at the Ibis Hotel. Knowing that I had FREE cancellation I booked and paid for a travelodge and attempted to cancel my original booking. The first room booking cancelled no problem but the second wanted to charge me £89 (the cost of the room) to cancel so I phoned ibis and they told me that I had to cancel via booking.com and he also told me that it's company policy to cancel for FREE. I then phoned booking.com, explained the situation, she put me on hold to phone ibis, came back to me and said the hotel have strict policies and will charge me £89 to cancel, I tell her that I have an email confirming FREE cancellation but she just says the word NO, I continue to fight my case but all I get from her is 1 word... No, over and over, at this point I'm starting to loose my s**t so I hang up and go to the bank. Whilst at the bank I discover that the £89 has already been taken from my account the day before I even mentioned the word cancel so I've now paid for the room already without even knowing and they still want to charge me a further £89 to cancel a room that I've already paid for without my permission against the T&amp;Cs that I agreed to. I then check my emails and find the confirmation booking of the second room which states that I will be charged £89 to cancel and the money for the room (£89) will be collected at any time. This is NOT what the site says, it CLEARLY states FREE CANCELLATION before you book yet once they confirmed the booking it was already too late, but I didn't know about the charges until I attempted to cancel because I received confirmation of first booking confirming FREE cancellation and thought it would be the same for second booking. This is at the least False advertising, they are tricking people into thinking that they are getting a service that they are not. Do not test me booking.com and ibis, I WILL take you to court!!!Reply to booking.com: I'm not an idiot! I did check before I booked and it clearly stated FREE CANCELLATION.

1373	            STAY AWAY from booking.com. This company is out to take advantage of anyone foolish enough to book a hotel room through their service.The company provides truly horrendous customer service. I have put a lot of time at this point into trying to get a small  refund of a cancellation fee.  The  last time I spoke to booking.com's customer service agent, he hung on me -- unreasonable and rude conduct. without a doubt.The dispute arises from after booking with them, I quickly realized (within 15 minutes) that the reservation would not work for me and  called booking.com to cancel.  I was assured I would get a refund for the cancellation fee if I submitted proof that the fee had been charged to my credit care. When the charge moved from Pending to Charged,  I submitted the proof,  but it wasn't enough because the scan of my online bank  didn't include the bank logo .In addition,  I did not see information when I booked about cancellation fees. INstead, the webpage emphasized that the charge would not appear until check-in. Only after the booking was confirmed was information about cancellation fees appear in a noticaeable way.

1376	            I'm a fairly regular traveller and have used Booking.com a number of times alongside several other well-known booking sites. What I started noticing on a recent trip away was that although Booking.com often offered lower prices than some other sites we ended up paying much more through hidden charges. These included things like cleaning fees that weren't notified until after point of sale to resort fees and suchlike. We had a particularly bad experience with them in Boston MA, after which I will definitely not use them again. The customer service on both sides (the accommodation and Booking.com) was absolutely appalling, I ended up paying twice as much as advertised for the accommodation, with both Booking.com and the owners treating me like I was the bad guy right from square one. A horrible experience and one I won't be repeating.        	                11	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

1378	            Booked almost a year in advance for a marathon weekend. Telephone call from Booking.com a few days before to say they had to cancel our stay but not to worry, they’d found some alternatives which they’d email to us. I noted they only rang coincidentally just after payment had been taken and I had just emailed an enquiry. A few hours later we received an email which simply had a link to the French version of booking.com. No alternatives at all, just a link to search which at such short notice yielded nothing but places 3 times the price and miles away. I emailed to ask if it was the an error that they sent the wrong link but no reply. I emailed again and eventually got a reply to say no, there’s no alternative and they’ll do nothing at all to help. So, we lost the entry fee and missed the marathon.        	                3	2	Tuesday	booking	negative

My story is very long, but I will try to give you some idea how awful  their customer service is and  how deceitful booking.com is. My family arrived in  Washington DC after a long drive from Toronto and did not find anyone at the property where we were supposed to stay for the night. After several hours, stranded  , with two very upset kids ,we had a help from a complete stranger. They did not let us know about the cancellation on time(from a guy in charge of the property  who could not be reached.....long story, but highly unprofessional behaviour)    and we ended up in another apartment, much more expensive, and significantly far away  from our original place. There were other problems during our trip but I will try to keep this short. I contacted their customer service numerous time and so far EIGHT different people sent me useless and deceiving emails, just trying to make me give up trying to get some justice and appology . They promised at least to refund us the difference in price between those apartments but it seems they are lying and I will get nothing except an almost ruined trip and valuable experience - NEVER book a trip with booking.com.I have no wish to send booking.com any messages on any type of a messenger. If booking.com cannot find my confirmation number and code (my first and last name are clearly stated here),they have no honest intention to give me any refunds. Ask around ,booking.com, EIGHT different people from customer service contected me and practically asked for almost the same things again and again, and again.

Searched one bed for less than a minute and found a small white bug that resembled a bed bug and then another larger darker bug. Stopped searching after that and left immediately. Took several hours and at nearly double the price to find another hotel for the night. Requested a refund for the difference, which was denied. Booking.com also said we needed bites examined by a doctor and provide a medical certificate. Did not stay at the original place booked by booking.com, but they will not provide any refund whatsoever. Booking.com claims the pictures and videos provided are not bed bugs and that they are ""sorry the room does not meet our expectations"", implying most people would be happy to stay in rooms with beds infested with bugs.

1387	            #booking.com Bear with me - this might take a while, but it's worth a read for anyone planning to book through booking.comI recently had a booking with an apartment via booking.com. I like to plan ahead so said apartment was booked months in advance with free cancellation until 14 days before arrival.13 days before arrival (a day after my free cancellation period ended) I was sent a link by the apartment to a long list of terms and conditions to electronically sign, that would have imposed additional potential charges if I had agreed to them. At the same time, they tried and failed to take payment from my card. I was not satisifed about effectively being forced to sign an agreement I was not happy with or risk forfeiting my accommodation rate. I had used booking.com for a reason - I consider it safe, secure and easy. I complained to booking.com. They agreed that this wasn't fair and concluded the terms and conditions proposed conflicted with those of the original contract formed with them.In short - booking.com offered a relocation, for which booking.com refunded me the difference no problem. They also assured me and sent confirmation that the original booking had been cancelled free of charge. However in the meantime said apartment, having not been able to take payment, proceeded to send me a debt collection letter with threat of legal action after 14 days if I didn't pay up. I complained to booking.com again and after a couple of days of back and forth they decided to escalate the issue to their 'partner behaviour department'. I was told this team are the best and highest level of complaints handling - they'd sort it. Marvellous. Two days passed and we hadn't heard anything. We call back - oh no that department usually takes a week. Right - assurances offered that we'd have a resolution today. Ok. We sit tight, getting close to that 14 day deadline but sounded like our complaint was with the right people finally.This morning I receive an e-mail from a booking.com customer service executive. She's decided this has gone on long enough (no kidding) and is going to remove us from the situation. We're going to be sent a link that refunds us for the amount the property are chasing us for so we can pay them off and stop any potential legal action in its tracks. Booking.com will then resolve any issues they have with the apartment without my involvement. Amazing, someone with a bit of sense and it seems to reflect what I had started to suspect - that I've been caught in the middle of some misunderstanding between the apartment and booking.com.One catch though, the amount offered doesn't match that stated on the debt collection letter (looks like the apartment may have considered the refundable deposit forfeit perhaps). No problem, I'm asked to send a copy of said letter so they can arrange for the correct amount to be refunded. That was 9am this morning. Silence. A couple of phonecalls from me mid afternoon to ask where the link has got to (I want to settle the matter and get to the weekend before that debt collection deadline looms early next week). I get a call at 4pm from a US colleague, she doesn't agree this is the best way to go. I lose it - this has been going on for three weeks now, I have an e-mail confirming the resolution and now someone's decided booking.com aren't going to proceed with that sensible action? Booking.com get another call from us - we're put through to the US. Everyone in the UK has gone home by 16.20 - but we're assured e-mails have been sent to the right people and it'll be Monday before someone gets back to us. Unbelievable. In summary, booking.com are pretty useless when it comes to protecting their customers if something goes wrong. The ludicrous thing is I've lost count of how many times they've said they will refund me if the property manages to take payment from my card. So why is this so hard to deal with?Lots of phonecalls, numerous times repeating ourselves and talking through customer service reps what's happened (who have a history of all this on a screen in front of them anyway), three weeks of mucking about with this is total (the last week and a half worrying about debt collection), an e-mail from me basically saying my wife is taking over the calls as I'm finding it too stressful to deal with (didn't seem to get much of a reaction) and completely fed up with a company that I have in the past been all to happy to recommend to friends and family (not anymore)I await a resolution on Monday but don't hold out much hope, will post updates here if possible.

1388	            Having used this site on a number of occasions successfully, I was confident that if I ever had an issue with a booking that it would be professionally dealt with. How wrong I was !In Oct 2017 I booked and paid in full for what was advertised as a triple room in a Belfast property. The booking was for myself but as I knew there might be others in my travel group looking for accommodation, I specifically went for the triple thinking I could add guests later once the travel groups accommodation requirements were known.Later I added another guest to the booking online in the manage your booking section. However I then received an email from booking.com saying the triple room was for a maximum of one guest, even though they confirmed it was a triple room. I managed to contact the property who also confirmed it was a triple room but that only one guest could occupy it. They could offer no reason why but said it was the policy of booking .com.I then contacted booking .com customer services who said the insistence on single occupancy was the property's decision, that If I had listed 2 guests when I first made the booking it probably would have been ok!!They would not entertain the idea that advertising a triple room that turns out to be for single occupancy is gross misrepresentation, refused to waive a cancellation fee and point blank refused a refund.In short they would not accept any responsibility for advertising a room which was totally misleading. Never never again will I use these cowboys.        	                2	1	Friday	booking	negative

Today I was looking at my bank account and found that a day after I booked my Luton hotel, someone had used my card details to book a hotel in Amsterdam.  Now the bank has had to cancel my card and issue a new one to avoid this person using my details again.  So this is the second American company, I have learned cannot be trusted with my money.In reply to Booking.com:  After my bank details being used, do you really think I will entrust you with a copy of my bank page and my email address as well. Sorry trust was broken.   My bank informed me that my booking was made on the 5th October, and the fraudulent one was made on the 7th October at about 23h30 but only appeared on my account on the 9th October.

1396	            We are staying in a Villa in Croatia advertised as 4 stars with lots of amenities.After we arrived we discovered the the Villa is in fact 2 stars.  I raised this with Booking.com who said the whole complex is 4 stars but our villa is 2 stars, what?!The invoice sent said to pay with cash on arrival in Euros.  We changed the amount needed into Euros, only for the hotel to refuse to accept Euros.  So we then had to change the Euros to Kuna, leaving us slightly short because of the conversation fees.  We tried to pay what we had in cash and the rest in card, but the hotel refused, saying it all had to be paid in cash or on card.  This means we now have to change our money back to sterling again and pay it back into the bank, losing yet more in the conversion.  I raised this with Booking.com, who said the small print said the property could charge in the local currency.  Why send a bill in Euros then?All the advertised facilities at the hotel and nearby are closed, leaving nothing to do, nowhere to eat or to buy supplies.  The pool at the hotel (our reason for choosing this one) is just above freezing making it completely unusable.  I raised this with Booking.com, who said this is perfectly normal because the Croatian season finished in September.

The following day late in the afternoon I was told I did not confirm this and was told to leave since someone else has made a reservation and it doesn't matter what evidence I have. I contacted booking.com the cs girl- Toni lied that I didn't confirm the request. She was so rude that she does not fit to be working in cs role. They offered me a lousy 10 Euros for being kicked out and left in heavy pouring rain which I decline to accept.When I forwarded the communication to the cs- Toni. Then she said its a private agreement and there's nothing booking.com can do about it and I will have to take it up with the people that kicked me out of the accomodation into the rain.I was a long term customer of booking.com and I urge you to avoid them at all cost.

1403	            We visited San Francisco. I wanted a good hotel to round off our visit to the US. At no time prior to arrival, including when we booked on booking.com, was there any reference to  the (expensive) hotel in Nob Hill being under renovation with very limited facilities. Neither could I find mention of this on the hotel website. There was no restaurant and the bar, which closed at 9.45pm, was located in the makeshift breakfast room on the 6th floor. Frankly we felt that the hotel was highly overpriced (even for San Francisco) for what was in practice essentially a budget hotel. In fact in the course of our 3 week visit to the US we stayed in many hotels for a fraction of the price which offered much better value.  We notice now that the (glowing) reviews for this hotel on booking.com all seem to be at least two months old. Still no mention of the renovation.

1404	            We recently spent 2 weeks in the USA using 4 hotels all booked through Booking.com. All 4 hotels took full payment immediately upon booking via booking.com...Or at least I thought they had. It turns out one of the hotels where we stayed for 5 nights actually took payment for the first 2 and last 2 nights and not the middle night. Now that seems a little odd to me. We were given no indication whatsoever that this had been the case. The hotel didn't mention it upon arrival or leaving. This may be the hotels fault for taking payment in this way, however booking.com's handling of my complaint was farcical to say the least.Phoned them up initially and I could tell the girl wanted me off the phone as quickly as possible. No interest in helping me, just directed me to a clunky and poorly thought out complaints form on their website.I began the complaint process as I felt I was mislead into my payment for the hotel and leaving me ~£180 down on money I had budgeted for my holiday.After starting the complaint process it took around 4 weeks of going backward and forward, hassle and general time wasting to get a response basically washing their hands of me.The complaint was obviously passed between many different handlers at their end and in the end I felt like they didn't even know what they were responding to!Booking.com - I advise you make the hotel payments more clear.For example, when I booked it wasn't obvious I would be charged immediately by the hotels.Also, if some hotels take full payment, and some only partial - advise the customer how much they will be charged!!It's left a very bitter taste for me and I won't be using Booking.com in the future!        	                15	1	Saturday	booking	negative

I just want my money back for a booking you cancelled why is it so difficult to get sorted????? Any one going on holiday I’d say go else where and avoid booking.com like the Black Death!        	                1	1	Thursday	booking	negative

1410	"            Do not travel and rely on Booking.com! Especially when you are booking ""last minute""! They are not informing you about that your reservation was cancelled and providing you with wrong information!The hotel  Appart’City Genève – Gaillard sends their guests away, even if they want to pay for the room and there is still a place to sleep!!!!!Yesterday I've made a reservation for my parents through Booking.com at hotel Appart’City Genève – Gaillard in France. They wanted to stay overnight at some hotel, because they were traveling by car for the whole day and they still had a very long journey ahead of them.Right after I submitted the reservation I got notification from Booking.com that the credit card we inserted was declined - so I corrected the details of the credit card and right after I received email from Booking that the card is okay and they are contacting the property.Not much longer time later we have received an email from the property Appart’City Genève – Gaillard - with a CONFIRMATION OF OUR RESERVATION - that everything is okay and they are expecting them to arrive. They also sent my parents a text message with further details about the reservation.However when my parents arrived to the hotel in the middle of the night, ready to pick up their keys- they were SENT AWAY BY SOMEONE FROM THE HOTEL STAFF! The reason for this was that the card was not accepted and they canceled the reservation!!!!Then I checked my email and I saw an email from booking.com that was sent just 2 hours before the check-in(!!!) that the reservation was canceled! How is this a great an excellent service from both the property Appart’City Genève – Gaillard and Booking.com when they LEAVE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT in a foreign country without internet connection WITHOUT ACCOMMODATION!?!! This is absolutely unacceptable attitude! Noone informed us about the cancellation! Do you think that people who are on the travels are able to check their emails frequently!??! Do you think that everyone owns a smartphone with data? Do you think that sending an email about cancellation only 2 hours before the check-in is good service? Noone called us - especially the property!!! This caused them searching for different accommodation in the middle of the night, after 12hours long car drive! Never booking with Booking.com and especially with  Appart’City Genève – Gaillard again.        "	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	positive
1411	            My view of this company is of a scam I recently booked a hotel for llandudno for May 2018 it stated free cancellation and pay at venue but the hotel took 310.00 straight away did not even know until bank in formed me I had no money to pay bills. This holiday is seven months away only a fool would pay upfront anything could happen .then hotel when asked said it was their policy to take whole amount .asking bank to raise visa dispute and also get legal advice as I would  never have booked a property on these  terms avoid this firm        	                15	1	Tuesday	booking	negative
1412	            The app sent updates to my hotel saying I would be arriving late 2 days after I had arrived, they also missed off the parking space and extra bed. I emailed to complain and despite having a reference number have received nothing in 14 days, not even a reply to my chaser email. Appalling customer service.Also, we very wary of their star ratings on hotel, all is not what it seems, especially in Asia, I’ve stayed in a 3 star hotel that was dirty and didn’t have a non smoking room or double bed despite me booking one. Disgraceful. Booking.com are happy to take their commission and leave you to it. Won’t be using them again.        	                12	1	Monday	booking	negative

My booking was authorised ror a cancelation up untill the 16th of october come the 14th the booking has now CHANGED to a non-refundable booking and  I can not get my money back. Out if pocket by £80 which is no small amount for a venue that is not worth that price. I booked the venue on the basis should I need to cancel I could so I know full-well what I read at the time of booking.

1416	            I became a Booking.com Property Scout Reward member by reviewing properties and submitting detailed reviews with pix (thus generating usable content for booking.com).  For few of the reviews, Booking.com paid out the $25 reward.  So far so good.In the meantime, whenever I was making the Booking.com reservation, a pop-up bar at the browser bottom would encourage me to make bookings over $50 and collect property scout $25 reward.  It never laid out ANY other condition.I then made 3 bookings: each over $50 so I can collect those rewards.  The booking numbers were: 1419656785, 2055820349, and 1554628744.  I then stayed at the first of the booking.  I noticed I didn’t receive any email from Booking.com advising me to collect the $25 reward so I emailed Booking.com customer service with the question on these three bookings.Suddenly I received an email notifying that they will cancel the third booking (the one which was one week away) and then they did.In the meantime, I stayed at the second booing.  I have asked them several times what happened with $25 reward and advised of the situation.  The only response I have received twice is that the user email has been rewarded.No sorry from them, no admittance of wrong-doing that they were entrapping the customers by advising them to collect $25 reward and not publishing the condition that you can collect only one reward.  Thus, they perpetrated a fraud on the unsuspecting public.  I am referring them to Mass Dept. of Consumer Affairs and US Dept. of Consumer Affairs so they can be prohibited from business in Mass and US (like they have been in Turkey).In the meantime, I have also voted with my feet and stopped using them since last one month and am now using their competitors.        	                6	1	Friday	booking	positive

1418	            The worst call centre ever! They have no audit trail of calls/emails and even if they did, they purposefully act ignorant. I had to explain my problem to eight different people, none of whom could provide me a satisfactory answer or took responsibility of the fact that their company was at fault. They don't give you a call reference number. I called them 8 times over a period of 3 days and half the time the person on the other end had no clue about the issue I was talking about, they had no way to check the history/records of past calls and complaints. Now, to the actual defect  on their website which shows contradictory information to users. Even if the 'free cancellation' time has passed at the hotel location, the booking.com indicator shows up as GREEN and says that you can cancel for free based on the fact that in your timezone the time is behind the hotel location. When I told them that I needed to speak to their IT help desk or complaints department they said there is none and cut the call saying we cannot help. One of the guys told me to cancel my credit card and said call another time when someone else answers. Truly awful. Their supervisors never come on the call even if I ask for them. The agents have either been strictly instructed to never to accept a mistake no matter what or have no understanding of how a website works (I would expect a company whose main operating model is via their website to have technically trained staff at the very least answering calls). Not sure how such big companies can act so irresponsibly. I think the UK govt and others should ban such sites as they operate very unethically. It would be very easy for a regulator to verify and reproduce the defect I have pointed out above, they can even try calling customer support to reproduce the same trail of hell I and I'm sure many others have gone through. I have given up but the Governing authorities can penalise the owners for this irregularity and for all the mental harassment customers must face. At least the ex chequer can benefit from this.        	                2	1	Thursday	booking	negative
1419	"            I recently made a booking via booking.com for a 2 night hotel stay. I specifically chose the free cancellation option because my partner and i's plans were up in the air. When attempting to cancel, I experienced some technical difficulties but after a few minutes, just in time, i was told it had been cancelled only to have now been charged a late payment fee of almost £100 by the hotel for a ""no show"". I called booking.com immediately who claimed there are sometimes technical issues when booking using smartphones/tablets but are refusing to take responsibility for their mistake and issue me with a refund. After speaking to both the hotel and booking.com for over an hour, I burst into tears at the realisation that I am now without money for groceries and a bill that needs paying and will on top of that be charged a fee by my bank for being overdrawn. After looking online I've realised this is a common complaint of booking.com as many users have experienced issues with the free cancellation offer not allowing them to cancel within the period of time given and then charging cancellation fees, i just wish I had known this beforehand. My advice to anyone thinking of signing up would be to be very careful, if not to just steer clear altogether.        "	                2	1	Thursday	booking	negative
1420	            I've used Booking for many years and it keeps going down in experience. Booking is now onboarding everything from hotels, bed-breakfast, hostels, to private homes, share rooms (just like Airbnb). However, Airbnb has more quality control. Booking pretty much does not care if the host treats you like crap, ignores your call, messages, makes you wait outside in the rain as they cannot communicate properly the check in time. If the host does not attend to your needs such as broken door, no hot water etc. Booking leaves you at mercy of these hosts that under false pretenses get your money (photos of the place that don't exist etc.).        	                1	1	Thursday	booking	neutral
1421	"            This webservice treats badly holiday home owners. One has no information on the guests - no reviews on the way they treated other properties by previous home owners like on airbnb or homeaway. And gives you no right to cancel a reservation. Even if you suspect that future guests might misbehave or damage your property you have no right to cancel. They tell you when you call them - we do not interfere in relationship between an hotelier and guests, if things get out of hand just call the police. Pointless to explain to them that holiday home is not a hotel and cannot afford a security guard. Very unfair and biased towards travellers with zero concern for home owners.Reply to my review from booking.com is simply not true. When submitting a review guests are asked among other things to rate Staff so they rate their Host. It's part of their ""stay"" experience. And I already described the response one gets when calling booking.com in case of trouble.        "	                3	1	Thursday	booking	negative
1422	            I used the booking.com site on Thursday night to purchase a hotel/room in Manhattan for October 27 to October 28 at Splendid Apartment in Times Square for a total of $455. I paid with my credit card and I booked the hotel. About an hour after I booked the hotel I received a email from booking.com stating my credit card is invalid and that it could not be processed however my booking was still valid and they suggested I contact my card provider. I went to the website and re added my card information. Then again another hour passed and I received the same email and did the process again with reentering my card information but this time I scanned it to make sure none of the information was incorrectly entered. I also emailed the email I was given with the credit card issue. I emailed them October 5 at 11.06 PM after I entered in the credit card information for the second time. I stated that I booked a from through booking.com, and received a email stating my credit card was invalid. I updated it and received another email however everything was correct so I asked what else i can do to fix the issue. They emailed me back stating they tried to charge the card twice and it was declined. they will try one more time however their merchant transaction provider will only let them charge three times. So I know the card has money on it so when they told me it was declined I first called my bank and asked what was going on. I told them what they apartments stated and asked how I could fix this issue. My bank told me on their part nothing was declined and that no transaction of that amount by that provider even tried to take out money. They said nothing is pending so they have no idea why the apartment stated it was declined because their is enough funds, and they accept international transactions. So I called the apartments on Friday morning October 6, and asked to speak with someone about this issue. I told them what my bank stated and confirmed over the phone the card information. The hotel personal told me they were going to call me back within the hour after they speak to their financial department and we might need to try a new card. I waited for a call back for about three hours until I contacted the hotel again. They told me they apologize that they got busy because everyone was checking in and out and they were going to contact me soon. I waited till the next day to then receive an email on October 7 at 530PM stating my reservation was canceled. Now I am extremely upset I contacted the hotel and they were extremely rude refusing to help me stating it was a Saturday night and to call back on Monday, which for one is extremely unprofessional as they stated they were going to contact me back to get the issue fixed and then decided to cancel without my permission. Now I am not sure what to do, if they would have contacted me back like they promised they were going to I would have provided them with another card even though the first one should have worked. Without warning they canceled my booking now I am out of luck at a place to stay for that date. The hotel staff that was rude on Saturday night stated they have nothing to do with this website and that they have no fault.  Now if that was the case they should not offer their services on your website. Please help me correct this ASAP, we have a trip planned for that date and this hotel was specifically picked for it location and price. I am currently very upset and do plan on contacting other sources if this issue is not fixed. I am not happy with how the hotel handled this situation especially because I was patient waiting for them to contact me when I was told my the hotel staff my room is saved and the issue will be fixed.        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	positive

They tried to charge about £400 concerning one night!  I called the hotel and was told that they only asked for an authorisation but the so called authorisation consists of the £400 being blocked. They first said that the money would go back to my account immediately but then, talking to a manager, he said that it would take two weeks. I felt as if I was loaning money, by force, to the hotel. The hotel said that they don't consider this authorisation to be a payment. But the money leaves my account.  Booking.com and that hotel can play with words as much as they want but the matter of fact is that they are just being dishonest. They say no ""pre payment needed"" and then they try to take money from my card?  What kind of service is that? If they are going to ask for this sort of prepayment, then say so.

1427	            My experience is rather recent and its still on going. I made a booking on the 1st October 2017  which showed up as free cancellation and after cancelling a few minutes later it says the fee for cancellation is the total amount i paid which is £505. Now the booking is for december 17 for a relative.I have been trying for the past week to get in touch bookings.com and i got differing opinions from their staff over the phone; i rang this morning an was told i was sent an email last night (which i never got) and that i have to speak with the property owner to broker an agreement myself.I have  rang the property and no one has answered, now i am left with the option of going there myself.I will update my review once its sorted or closed.So, today the 13th Oct 2017, i went to the property and i meet a guy who welcomes people to the property and he was very welcoming and he rang the owner who answered his call once ( as suppose to Bookings and myself not been able to get hold of him), after speaking with him he in turn referred me back to Bookings.com and he hung up (wasn't very helpful), so i rang Bookings and i was told to stay on the line whilst they ring him, he didnt answer again, so i was told he will be sent an email to ask if he can make a 'partial refund'; to be honest at this point i do not mind 5 - 10% off the £505 i paid. But come to think of it, the booking was for 2 months away.I expect both the property owner and Bookings to do right by people....this is purely messing a customer about.In response to the response to this review, i am not calling your customer service at all.I will wait a few more days and see what the response is.        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	positive

Getting back my money is a No brainer as i paid with Paypal and i Will dispute iT Anyway. But the extra promise companesation never arrived and when i called there always Nothing mentioned about iT. WoW just So you know when using booking.com..there is a risk involved. Quality of what they offer or promise cant be trusted anymore. Or if you do, do iT at Your own peril.        	                2	1	Wednesday	booking	negative
1439	            I have been charged £212 for a booking that I cancelled via telephone. The hotel are claiming that I didn't cancel so therefore I am charged for not showing up.Booking.com have offered me no help and have sent me one email saying I won't receive a refund. I am disgusted and I cannot afford this kind of mistake, I did what I needed to do so how is this ok? This is fraud ion a grand scale.        	                2	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

They continually bombard you with generic, impersonal and useless emails that don't help when your half way round the world and stranded. They are toothless tigers when put on the spot, the final straw for me was the email I received that didn't have my correct name or correct gender.        	                2	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

1445	            I love booking.com as they have really good choice of hotels. I have managed to get the room I have booked on every occasion. I find the service rather reliable, have been using it for nearly 10 years. Furthermore, it servers like hotel library.There may some times, when its rather difficult to search for the right hotel, when you bombarded with pop up windows or sold out hotels are listed in between listings. A few times I had an issue, such as booking room with a balcony in a hotel, where there are no balconies. On the other occasion it was the price. If you choose hotel currency and you come to the hotel they may tell you that they except only local currency which doesn't match with your destination currency. In the end they would charge you at inflated exchange rate. This was nearly always hotels flows.However, booking is one of the best travel agents I ever used. I would not ever hesitate to use this service.Many hoteliers also love it, as there are simple rules and no third  parties        	                6	5	Sunday	booking	positive

1448	            I was using booking com for 6 years. It was mostly ok, and I was always choosing booking com. Until today.Around month ago I booked 5 hotels for my Italian trip for 3 people. Somehow there was a mistake and one of the hotels was booked for 1 person. With a price which actually suits for 3-people-room! When I contacted booking com a month ago, they told me that they can see, it is not my mistake since I have booked several hotels and all for 3 people. They contacted host, he or she refused to cancel with no fee, and booking com did not notify me. I wrote them yesterday, and they claim that it is my fault!!So be aware: technical errors are rare, but they can happen to anyone. And if it will happen to you, booking com wont help you. It does not matter if you are loyal customer. They simply don't care about customers anymore.UPDATE: a week ago I contacted the host of the hotel. Turned out that the room has 3 places, and I need to pay 40 euro per day to use what was claimed from the beginning. Additional 40 euros in cash! I wrote booking com regarding that. One week later I got email from booking com telling me that they cannot do anything and it is still my fault. Five minutes later the owner of hotel wrote me telling that booking com contacted him and told him what I wrote in my last email. Booking com did not do anything to protect me as a client, but protected a person who cheated on me! Amazing!!!

1449	            Earlier this year I had booked a home to use for the purpose of filming. The property provider was fully informed of this and I had spoken with him over the phone to explain what I was looking for and what the film would entail. He stated that he was happy with this; this was 6 weeks before the scheduled date. I called to confirm 2 weeks before the scheduled date and the provider was still on aboard with the project. With less than 12 hours before my check-in time I received an email from Booking.com stating that my booking had been cancelled. I was shocked when I received this email around 11pm (it was sent at 6:30pm) – as it meant that I could not rebook anywhere else as most places were closed for business. I contacted booking.com the following morning and explained my situation and the urgency for them to provide another place (I had a film crew and cast that were expecting a venue to at film at in less than 6 hours). The agent himself was shocked by my experience and stated that a cancellation could not be processed unless both parties agreed to it; he stated that my response had not been sent, thus the cancellation should not have been permitted. He tried to reach the property provider, but could not; he also couldn't reach the agent that over rode the system to permit the cancellation - as the person was away. His friendly assistance, although futile, is the reason why I have given this company 2 stars instead of a much deserved 1 star; he attempted to find another venue - but due to short notice, he was unable to and was extremely apologetic about this.A few days after the scheduled date of my stay, I was sent an email asking for my views on the service I received. I was extremely vocal about it and asked to be kept informed about the outcome of my comments; this was in April, we are now reaching the end of September, and until now, I have received nothing!I am thankful that this was not a situation where I travelled to another country, and upon arrival have nowhere to stay.

Within 24 hours the hotel had pre authorised my card taking over £1256 pounds out of my account even thought it states clearly nothing to pay until you reach the hotel its in the policies set on your confirmation booking sheet. Tried to phone and email booking.com but takes for ever to get threw and then finally it was explained that the hotel is allowed to do this but it does not say that on booking clearly states no money will be charged and and I was given the brush off. Some 7 days later the money went back into my account. Now 8 days before I travel they want to pre authorise the same card again telling me the old authorisation has expired what a load of rubbish.They have my card details and it states that if I cancel 2 days before a certain amount will be taken, and if on the day the full amount . I don't have a problem with this as I intend to travel and not cancel. Spoke to booking.com for over an hour and also emailed the hotel 3 times but only get broken English messages back.

This is a way in which the hotel owner or house owner can create flaws and bad reviews for each other - which is not conducive to any parties.That kind of conversation does not give a fair picture of the guest's experiences, the hotel owner and landlords can not improve what the guest was dissatisfied with. This way,it is difficult to make developments and improvements for both the hotel owner and other landlords, if the guest are anonymous and make bad rating without comments.

Once we had landed in Prague we was met by a text from the lady who owned the apartments saying that booking.com had overbooked the apartments. So we were stuck in a foreign country with no place to say. They sorted us somewhere else €25 more expensive which was much worse than our original apartments. But although promised compensation, it was made a really difficult process by demanding receipts from both hotels - we don't have a receipt from our first one because we didn't pay anything.

We waited in the reception area (being a private owned apartment this was not a hotel so no bar or restaurant) with 2 small children no food, drinks or toilets for 2 hrs, at 14.35 no-one had turned up, both mobiles were running out of batteries so we was starting to panic a bit, we rung booking.com again who told us to wait a further half an hour (what a joke) at 15.10 we rung them again, finally after another half hr on the phone to booking.com, they tell us they have another apartment for us, our original apartment was a 2 bedroom with own swimming pool, washing machine and kitchen with equipment at a cost of £1100, the replacement was a 1 bedroom apartment with shared swimming pool no washing machine and at a cost of £1200 going through booking.com, by this point I was not happy so we got the address of the new apartment and went there ourselves, we arrived at the new apartment spoke to reception who was very nice and helpful (a lot more helpful then booking.com) for the apartment that booking.com was going to charge at the rate of £1200 cost us £475 (big differences) going straight to the hotel itself, booking.com did not contact us through out our stay to check that we was ok and arrived safely to anywhere, as a big company like this I think it's unacceptable, we I arrived Back in the U.K. I emailed booking.com with my complaint and did not get a reply I have spent the last 3 weeks on the phone to them trying to sort this out with management refusing to talk to me, and   customer service hanging up on me when I state that they would not be happy with the offer that was made to me, it just boils down to they just don't care about their customers they have made an offer of £72 in compensation they think this is acceptable, after looking into it further myself I have come to conclusion that booking with the hotels directly is cheaper then going through booking.com and that you are more likely to be guaranteed a bed to sleep in that way, as booking.com does not keep in regular contact with their supplier, on that note i will not use booking.com again and would advise people to double check your bookings in future.        	                1	1	Saturday	booking	positive

Phone number given was of another aggregator who wouldn’t give any info since I didn’t have a local India phone number (!).  I complained about this to booking.com but no response.  All this was on review hence booking.com is censoring the review.  They have been paid – why should they care anymore?(2)	Booking #1534772019 at Suite Dreams Hostel, Istanbul, TurkeyProperty never responded how to get to it from airport AND booking.com never told me that they are legally not allowed to operate in Turkey because they have lost a lawsuit filed against them.  The warning about not being able to book properties in Turkey only shows if you access booking.com from inside Turkey, not if you are out of Turkey.  Between them, they put me in harm’s way by not providing directions and npt telling me I should make alternate arrangements for subsequent bookings.  I had to use another aggregator in Turkey and now plan to ditch booking.com and use that aggregator only.RESPONSE to BOOKING.COM Reply:(1) The link in case of Istanbul property was about the Airport Shuttle operated by Turkish Government, I have no interest in that.  Neither you nor the property told me how to get to property from airport and as if that was not enough, when I figured out the airport shuttle and tried to share it with others, you didn't allow that - how does this work?  What do you call it, if not censorship?(2) You have incorrect info - NO ONE inside Turkey can book Turkish properties, whether Turkish citizen or not, thru Booking.com - message at the top states this and any location in Turkey returns zero matches.  So, by not informing me that once I am in Turkey I can't book any property thru Booking.com in Turkey, did you place me in harm's way or not?  I had to use Hotels.com and HostelWorld to book properties in Kusadasi, Pamukkale, Konya, Goreme, and Ankara.        "	                18	1	Friday	booking	negative
1476	"            Extremely poor service -I am still awaiting  a refund that was due on my account on September 14th. I have still not received a refund of £140 into my account despite your email of September 14th informing me that it would be in my account within 3-5 business days.  I called your office yesterday and was informed that the refund would be in my account this morning. It was not. I have just called your office and spoke to a man who informed me he would speak to Finance and call me back. He called me back and told me that the refund would not be in my account until Tuesday 26th September as you do not give refunds until after 12 days? This is despite sending an email suggesting it would be in my account by Wednesday 20th at the latest.When I asked if I could speak to a manager he informed me that he could not put me through to a manager as they do not speak to guests. I jokingly said - ""are we not important enough then"" to which the reply was ""That is correct"". As a manager in a customer based industry this attitude towards your customers quite frankly appals me. Clearly you do not feel your customers worthy of your attention.I have now just received a phone message informing me that my refund has been cancelled and will not be made at all.I would be grateful if you someone could respond to me today informing me when the money will be in my account - if you do not pay out refunds until 12 days have passed this should be highlighted so that customers have the chance to chose a different company. I would also like to know who I can escalate this complaint to unless as your member of staff suggests you are not interested in your customers.        "	                1	1	Friday	booking	neutral
1477	"            On their site my booking is advised as ""one of your best sellers"" with a very good location. But nothing like that is true. This property is one big scam.We got to the Potzdamer Platz in Berlin and walked from there to the location (near the intersection of ""Wilhelmstraße"" and ""An der Kolonnade""), only to find a big construction site. A local noticed our confusion and asked if she could help us, but she was not aware of a hostel in that direct area. We checked booking.com but there was no actual address on your whole site for this property, so we called the listed phone number.A man picked up. He didn't speak German and his English wasn't very good either. He wasn't very friendly and urged to be fast (we would have been if he would have given us a correct address in the first place). He sent us to the intersection of ""Möcknerstraße"" and ""Obentrautstraße"". If you check the map: That's quite a walk. By the time we got there, both our phones were empty from navigating all day. Again: Nothing. We asked a lady who was walking her dog. She got the question before, but had no clue about a hostel in the area.Frustrated we went to the Hotel Am Potzdamer Platz that was nearby, in the hope they knew about this hostel. They didn't. They tried to look it up but couldn't find anything about it and asked if we were sure about the name. We got allowed to use their business center to check the booking. The name was correct. We noted the number and got permission to use thier phone. Again we spoke to the person not speaking proper English. This time he was even less friendly, but he gave us an actual address and also sent us a mail with the address in it ""Möcknerstraße 113"".Now if you would check the map, you will see that this address is NOT in Berlin-Mitte, as advertised when booked. The address is somewhere halfway in Kreuzberg in a quite bad neighbourhood where we didn't really feel safe.Once we got there, it was an appartment complex with a lot of doorbells, but none for the Hostel. We pressed some random doorbells until somebody opened the front door for us. There was a mailbox with ""BNB"" on it, but still no appartment number. We knocked on a random door. The lady who opened didn't know the hostel but gave us 2 options to try within the building. The next door we tried seemed to be the correct one - After 2.5 hours of searching, mind you.An unfriendly man opened and was barely able to ask my name. He called with somebody and gestured us in. Only for us to get the next shock.If you check your site, you will see nice beds in rooms. This was nothing like advertised (again). The living room of the inhabitans containd a small closet, a table with some chairs, a stretcher and a sofa. We paid for beds in Berlin Mitte, but got couchsurfing in a shady neighborhood. The couple owning the place didn't speak English at all, but the (friendlier) wife showed us via Google Translate that she was still cleaning for 10 minutes (even though we got there a lot later than expected). After this we went to sleep dead-tired and frustrated. In stead of a nice evening in Berlin we had nothing but trouble and frustration.The beds were too short and we didn't get a good sleep. Eventually we got up early because we both had pain in our backs. Our phones charged over night and showed us that we were in central-west Kreuzberg, in stead of Berlin Mitte. The distance to the Brandenburger Tor was not a Quater Mile (like advertised) but 2.6km.Not able to talk to anybody about this. We tried to make the best of is. Our frustration got bigger when we found a hotel near Berlin Mitte (Ibis Budget) that had rooms available for only 95 per night - including breakfast. So for only 2 euro more, we could have gotten a decent hotel, with breakfast on a better location.To top it all: When I got home they charged 30 euros more from my creditcard than the advertised price (which was WAY too high for what we got to begin with).For some time now, friends of mine (all frequent travellers) are complaining about booking.com and are advising me to switch to another site where the service is better and they also have lowest price guarantee.=============================================As for the advise of booking below: I did contact them, they don't respond. I contacted them again and they only started responding after I complained on Facebook. Then they feed you lies and stories that contradict each other, including making you look bad on facebook. But then: When you present them with photographic proof about the situation: They just start ignoring you, knowing damn well how wrong they are.        "	                1	1	Friday	booking	negative
1478	"            I wish I could give them a 0.  Booking.com has the worst customer service I have ever dealt with!!  I spoke to two women on the phone, both were rude and condicending.  Both simply stated policy over and over again.  Their website clearly stated that my card would not be charged prior to check in.  Well, it was charged, and caused various other charges to be overdrafted to the tune of $140.  Booking.com told me that I could cancel the room, but since it was already paid for, I should just keep it.  The ""manager"" was the rudest woman I have ever spoke to.  She continually said I was wrong and it was my mistake and that they would do nothing to help.  And when I told her the website was unclear, she began to argue with me and tell me that it wasn't and, again, my opinion was invalid.  I am hoping the hotel I booked has more compassion and understanding than booking.com.  Do not use this company if you are looking for proper customer service.

Also please stop emailing me extra discounts on my bookings as I am always told I don't qualify when I do, therefore stop clogging my inbox with your nonsense.        	                1	2	Thursday	booking	negative

Will never use them again (after giving them glowing reports on previous occasions) Had another email saying its the hotel that will not refund which is rubbish as just spoken to the manager.

1487	            I booked three hotel through 'booking.com' on last bank holiday 26-Aug 2017.1- I booked the first one then cancelled immediately, as they not accept kids, but they refuse to refund me the cost, the reason I booked that room by mistake is because on the iPad, the booking button and the hotel condition items are displayed in the separate page, it's a design issue for 'booking.com' website, which caused the confusing.I emailed booking.com, oringinal response from ' booking.com' customer service is: it's your own job to negotiate with the hotel if they wish to return you the cost or not, good luck!2- then I booked another hotel called 'moon house' in Oxfordshire, I special sent a email and check if they accept child , the owner quickly replied and said all welcome. But when we turn up, the owner said my daughter is slightly older than they expect ( my daughter is 3, and they didn't check how old is my daughter, all by guessing.) their daughter is applying oxford university, don't want to be disturbed, so they not allow us to stay. Then we have to cancel the moon house. And look for another hotel , it was already quite late , my daughter is very tired, she been crying a lot in the way. 3- then I quickly booked another hotel, then booking.com send me two request to ask me fill my card information, I thought the first one not done properly so I filled up again. But after that I got two confirmation saying I booked two too girl the same night.I called vpbooking.com customer service request them to cancel one of the hotel, then they just say the hotel has closed, no moe follow up after this.Lucky the owner of the hotel they found two room booked for same night under same person, so they cancelled one for me and didn't charge me any money!Very disappoint yo booking.com,Won't use it again, and dont recommend it!        	                2	1	Sunday	booking	negative

When I realised the error i contacted them straight away but they refused to alter the booking.. just repeating it was non-refundable... despite it being a website error. Contacted them on several occasions even after contacting the hotel who said Booking.com could cancel it as the third party involved. No help whatsoever to resolve. Recently I noticed the price had even halved since I booked..I filled in the price promise forms four times on the Booking.com website where it promises to price match...and not one single person bothered to respond!.

1493	"            Booking.com used to be amazing.  I would rave to everyone about how their customer service would always try to help you, even if you might need to cancel a night outside of policy etc.  Recently, I've had a string of bad experiences with booking.com and have come to realise that the company has drastically changed.  Recent bad experiences include: 1. Misleading and deceptive pricing: I booked an apartment in San Sebastian.  Throughout the booking process, the price was flashed in big numbers with the book now button. I proceeded with the booking and after it confirmed the payment it had added €50 on for cleaning! When I rang booking.com, after a massive wait on hold they told me that the cleaning fee was advised nearby the price.  Why wouldn't you just include it in the total price you are stating throughout the booking?  If I want to worry about cleaning fees and other hidden fees, then I'd just use AirBnB.  This happened yet again at another property just last week, even though I had looked through the details of the pricing quite thoroughly.  I literally had to dig through my whole reservation and search for where it advised me of the cleaning fee after the owner of the property asked me to pay for it.  Hey Booking.com - not being transparent in your pricing is not going to win you happy customers. In the first instance the guy from customer service was doing his best in fairness and gave me some discount off the cleaning fee but I do still feel cheated. 2. False Advertising &amp; No responsibility taken: I booked a property in a small town in Italy and wanted to make sure I could park nearby to the property as my Mum couldn't walk very far.  Spent time using all the filters to find a place that offered free parking on site etc. Finally booked a place that advertises free parking on site. I call the place as we're nearing and the guy tells me the parking is in the public car park at the entrance to the town and is €10 per day. Not a big deal, but if I'd factored in the cost of the parking I might have picked a different property who had clearly stated that.  So for me this clearly false advertising. I ring Booking.com to explain the situation, to which the response is ""we are just a platform, the property owner can write whatever they like.  If you want to cancel we will have to call the property to see if they will waive the cancellation fee."" At this point I'm shocked, since Booking.com should realise that the contract should be invalid because of the false information in the listing. Anyhow, the property accepts the cancellation and all is fine, but they didn't have to according to Booking.com and Booking.com were not willing to stand by the information published on their site. 3. Availability issues: I spent a good hour trying to select a property.  Finally settled on one, booked it then went to bed. 10 minutes later my phone starts buzzing with messages. The owner of the property is sending me WhatsApps saying that she forgot to update her availability with Booking.com and that the property isn't available for that date and I need to cancel. Her cancellation policy would mean I'd have to pay for the night, so I told her no, she would need to ring Booking.com to explain the situation and cancel. She responds that it's too late in the evening but she'll do it in the morning. So now I have to spend the night unsettled about where I'm supposed to sleep the following night because I don't want to book another room without knowing I'm going to get my refund. In the morning, I had another issue (the next one on my list) so have to call Booking.com anyhow. I mention this cancellation by the owner and they have to call her etc to confirm this is the case. They come back to me to confirm and tell me the reason she can't honour the booking is because her toilet is broken. Which is not the case at all since the property owner told me she had overbooked. Maybe not Booking.com's fault because it seems the property owner lied to them for whatever reason but it just looks really bad all round.  Not to mention I used to be able to rely on my bookings through the site, but now it seems I have to worry about whether property owners have updated their availability etc etc.  Again, I might as well be using Air BnB and dealing with individuals directly. Booking.com on this did in fairness handle the cancellation well and offered to pay the difference on alternative accommodation and their customer service was efficient about handling it. Still a lot of back and forth on the phone though to fix the situation. Then once it's all confirmed the woman from the property starts sending me messages again to understand what happened on the phone with Booking.com, if she was in trouble for lying to them etc etc. Quite a hassle. 4. Hidden Charges: The morning after I book a property, as I'm finishing my coffee about to head to the place, I receive an email from the property informing me that they are a holiday apartment and therefore they do not provide sheets and towels, and that if I want sheets and towels I will have to pay a €40 charge. We were only staying in the place for one night. I ring the place furious - by this point I'm so angry with Booking.com and their deceptive ways of doing business.  The guy is surprisingly nice and says he'll speak to the owner and see what they can do.  Says the reason it isn't mentioned in the listing is that Booking.com doesn't give them anywhere to include this charge. It all works out and he apologises and says they will waive the fee this time, thankfully. I advise Booking.com regardless because, if I wasn't willing to stand up for myself, I would again have been slugged with extra hidden fees. Pricing should be TRANSPARENT. Include your fees in the price advertised. Not in small text.  Not after the fact. The email regarding the extra charges was sent via the Booking.com system and I also advised them of the email. They didn't seem to care, since it was resolved. They shouldn't be allowing these sorts of practices.  I've now had it up to my neck with Booking.com, I'm clearly seeing that I need to find alternatives for my travel because they can no longer be relied up. Most of the time customer service are helpful and polite, so that's at least a plus but I don't want to have to be calling customer service so many times when I'm supposed to be on holidays. I'm also losing money because I have to call the UK line (they seem to give better service than the Italian line). I lost hours trying to fix up the issues, when I should have been lying on the beach. Look for alternative sites. Book with proper hotels. If you want to stay at someone's apartment, try going through AirBnB. At least on their site they are more obvious about not being transparent with the pricing and you expect a mess with the property owners.I would change my mind a be a fan of Booking.com once more if they went back to including all charges in the quoted prices and agreed to stand by the information published in the listings on their site.

1494	            Booking.com lured us by advertising big discount on the Philadelphia Airport Renaissance Marriott hotel. Booking.com let us fill in the online form for accommodation of 4 adults and 2 children, including specification for ages of the children, accepted our payment and provided us with online confirmation. When we arrived at the hotel, we were told that the hotel room that was booked for us cannot accommodate 4 adults. We had to book another room and pay much more than what we had budgeted for . Renaissance reception said that they have had similar issues with booking.com before, asked them to fix their website, but still issue remains. The worst part was the horrible customer service we got from booking.com when we called them . They kept arguing about how they cannot really help us and it is our responsibility to verify everything with the hotel. It seemed to me they were telling us not to believe what was written on their website. After an hour on the phone they said they would reimburse us for just half of the extra cost we incurred. But we will have to submit documentation , have the case escalated and waste more time with booking.com to get back half of the extra amount we were forced to pay.

So I arrived at apartment having text owner who confirmed to me there would be someone there to let us in. 2 hours later no key holder and they are now ignoring my txt and calls. Phone Booking customer service and within 20 mins key holder shows up with some poor excuse. Booking phone to make sure everything okay and offer Italian translater if any more problems. In the morning pool of water appears and lecky goes off. Try key holder who again ignores my calls and texts. Phone booking customer service again and within 20 mins key holder shows up with boiler man etc and problems are resolved. The property is fine but without the support from booking.com customer service I am not sure what would have happened.

1501	            I'm very worried. I booked a villa in Spain for end October 17. It's a surprise birthday gift for my granddaughter who lives in France. 4 of them will travel by car - 7 hours! We will fly from Liverpool even tho we live under the Birmingham flight path. All booked!!  Suddenly Booking.com have emailed &amp; said it was the wrong price &amp; we have to pay another £80 per night!!!! Too late- I've told all the family &amp; paid for flights.

1507	            When my booking went wrong, I feared the worst after reading some bad reviews on here but my experience was the opposite. I booked a hotel using the iPhone app and when the confirmation arrived it was for the wrong weekend (didn't know how it happened). I phoned the hotel but they were very reluctant to change the dates as I had booked via a broker (Booking.com) so they gave me the free customer service number for Booking.com. On the app it was telling me that I would still have to pay for a cancellation! I phoned to ask if there was any way I could change the dates and not pay the cancellation fee. The girl I spoke to was absolutely wonderful, she explained that they had been having some problems with the app reverting to a date from a previous search so there were a lot of people who had the same problem as myself. She changed my arrival dates and I was charged at the same rate even on the different date. I later recieved email conformation that day. She was very helpful and cheerful on the phone even though she had just been through a hurricane where she lives in Florida!        	                7	5	Wednesday	booking	negative

1510	            I used Shocking.com to book a trip to Newcastle in August. We booked our trip in June and unfortunately two of the couples that were supposed to come with us could not make it, as one of them was diagnosed with leukemia. I contacted Booking to ask to see if we could cancel. After several emails i still had no answer two weeks later. I had to give two of the rooms away free of charge to friends, rather than loose them all together. To be honest I wish that I had just not bothered going. The so called hotel was the worst place I have ever stayed. The friends that I took got bed might bites. The hotel was not cheap either. Note when you look at there reviews for hotels they don't put the reviews in date order, they are all over the place 10 good ones with different dates and then one bad one. Very crafty and misleading. I will never use them again even if they are giving the hotel rooms away for free. By the way avoid the Grainger hotel in Newcastle.        	                8	1	Monday	booking	positive
1511	            Awful company reviews are not consistent and they put the more favourable ones to the first page instead of by date order, so getting a current idea of hotels means having to sift through reviews.

I booked a too-ambitious itinerary and was physically unable to complete it all, including a nonrefundable 400 euros in Pontone Hills in Amalfi Italy.  I notified Booking.com and they sent a special request to Pontone hills with the above info. Pontone hills obtusely replied I needed to cancel through booking.com which of course I had done. I was unable to further email the property through booking.com. I wanted to warn them of the nature of the review they were going to get. Also this one for booking.com. just passing the buck, no real reply to my situation.

1513	            Tried to book a hotel for my parents. Typical 3 star comfy hotel around the corner from me so I know it well. 14 nights apparently £13,916.00 for 2 people! Obviously an error, which happens, but then a big red message flashes up that somebody else has just booked my exact two weeks so I better hurry up! They must have money to burn. What a load of baloney. How can you be expected to trust a website that uses such cheap and devious tactics to try and put pressure on people.

1514	            I have been using Booking.com for several years but recently their practices have become less customer focused and almost deceptive. Their search facilities are excellent and their booking process very easy, however be prepared for them to tell you that you will pay at the hotel but then take full payment from your card up to two weeks prior to arrival. After speaking to the hotels, they don't even get the payment for several weeks after the stay. I brought this to the attention of Booking.com with photographic evidence and they can't even be bothered to respond to calls or emails. Secondly I arrived at one hotel in France and the room was the owners bedroom (not as described on Booking.com website) I contacted Booking.com from the hotel and I was informed it is an issue between me and the hotel owner and it was not an issue for them. From my recent experiences it appears Booking.com have become less customer focused and far less helpful. My advice is use other sites such as Trivago, Hotel.com or after finding the hotel ring them directly.Booing.com ... get focused on your customers!*** In answer to your response, I'm not on Facebook!! Give me a phone number where someone will actually listen ***UPDATE! *** Point in case proven.

We have offered to re book at a later date but no response just a constant confirmation of the booking and the fact the payment will be taken.It seems impossible to communicate with anyone to resolve this situation which I am sure will affect many.Have booked many times through this site previously but will be reluctant to do so again        	                3	1	Sunday	booking	neutral
1516	            I have always used Booking.com to find keenly priced good accommodation. I recently used the site to book a hotel called Aguas de Geres in the north of Portugal. Reported that the hotel does NOT have swimming pool as shown on the advert. The pool is in actual fact a municipal pool and clearly closed for most of the year.This contravenes all EU legislation regarding sale of goods! Despite contacting Booking.com nothing has been done. The swimming pool is still on the site whilst it does not appear on facilities regulated by Portuguese Tourist Board!        	                5	3	Saturday	booking	positive
1517	            If I could give booking.com a negative star I would. I booked a hotel for September 23 of this year. The date still is on my app. When I received the email confirmation the date for the reservation said for the night I made the reservation. I called to let them know they made a mistake. According to them it was no refundable and that the crown plaza wasn't responsible.  It was not my mistake it was booking.com. Booking.com should make good on it. Not I or the hotel. I had to pay over $200 for their mistake.  Do your self a favor and book directly with the hotel. They all have reward programs now.  I am going to do my best to fight this.        	                1	1	Saturday	booking	neutral
1518	"            The booking process said ""free reservation"" so I went continued to reserve my room.  Immediately after completing this process, the first night's payment of £100 was taken (effectively as a deposit) so I could not cancel even though booking was months ahead!  This was not a free reservation in any way, shape or form!  When I complained about this and said I wanted to cancel Booking.com refused and said it was in the ""small print"".  I would never book with them again.  Their customers services is awful too.  The reply from Customer Services below just shows they are not listening at all.  I am aware of the difference between free cancellation and flexible rates and so forth.  However, the booking said FREE RESERVATION and I took that at its word.  Only to find out that there is small print later on in the booking contradicting this.  The Free Reservation No Payment Now was clearly meant to deceive (and confuse) customers.

1519	            The way the site is set up offering 'deals' and 'book now you can always cancel' lulls the users into a false sense of security.

I could cancel but I would lose my full fee - so what is the point ! Horrible experience and left me feeling conned.

1520	            Was thinking of having a break in Jersey in September so in May I reserved 2 possible hotels both with free cancellation. About 2 weeks later I realised I wouldn't be able to make the trip so I logged in online to cancel them both. I think the website must have been down as I kept getting an error message asking me to try again later, so I called Booking.com instead and asked for both bookings to be cancelled. I was asked if I wanted to change one of them to a later date but I said no because I wasn't sure when we'd be able to make it. I was told the bookings were cancelled and that I'd receive an email confirmation shortly. I didn't receive the email and to be honest I get so many emails from them I probably didn't notice it. Anyway, because I thought I'd probably deleted the email, I called one of the hotels and was told that it must have been cancelled as they could not find a reservation in my name. So I left it at that and didn't call the other to check assuming Booking.com had done their job. Now we get to September and I get a call at 22:00 from one of the hotels asking if I was still coming! I was very surprised as I told them my booking was cancelled months ago. I called Booking.com the next morning and they informed me that both bookings were stilll there and never cancelled. They deny me ever calling them. They say there is no record of my call at all to cancel and say that I will now be charged for at least one night.  I'm not mad or losing my mind I know I made the call to cancel. I am so angry because I've never had a problem with them before and now wish I had waited until the website was working again to cancel my bookings. I will not use them again. Totally incompetent and their mistake will probably cost me money. 😡        	                2	1	Saturday	booking	negative

I booked apartment in Poland but when I got there the cooker wasn't working so for start they apologized and offered 20% discount. When I didn't get the refund contacted booking.com and they were helpful at first contacting the hotel and confirmed the payment has been sent to me. As still did not received contacted again and they were very rude saying there is no proof on their record, told me to send track of emails etc. Was treated like it was my fault not hotel giving me not usable apartment.

1522	            The service I have received from booking.com has been awful. I booked accommodation in Marbella for 16 women for a hen do. 2 weeks before I was due to stay I rang the accommodation who confirmed they had no record of my booking. I then spent 5 hours (mainly on hold) and then subsequent calls backwards and forwards to the owner of the property trying to sort my reservation out. They then informed me that I needed to pay an extra 350 euro for my stay. Booking.com gave me written confirmation that if I paid it they would refund me the difference as the booking mistake was their error. It is now 6 weeks after my stay and I have emailed them receipts which they have not given me a refund, every time I call I get excuses and then get told to ring the owner for a refund, even though I have it in writing they owe me money. I was lucky I rang the accommodation before the stay otherwise I would not have anywhere to stay at all. DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM.        	                1	1	Friday	booking	negative

1524	            I booked a hotel stay via Booking.com on the 24th May virtually going by the general description on their website. The cost was 58 Euros. There was also a section for me to complete as the hotels check in time was up to 8pm. I stated that we would be arriving between 10pm-11pm. On arriving at the hotel about 10.30pm (I will also say that the area felt very unsafe and looking like tourists it wasnt the nicest of areas to be in searching for a poorly signed accomodation), we paid the 58 euros plus 2 euros each person for tax. That was fine. Then, after making the payment, the person then went onto say that because we arrived after the check in time, he now wanted a further 15 Euros. He brought up an email that he stated was sent to me on the 24th May informing me of this. I had printed the only email I had received, with no indication of this additional payment. He was adament that I would have received it, and I assured him, if I had, then at that total cost I would have cancelled the accomodation, as for the price it made it, I could have stayed at a better hotel. As he had already used my credit card to take the initial payment, i had no choice but to hand over the extra amount he was demanding. Surely if the hotel make a change to the payment stated, then I should have been sent an updated email from the agent to confirm this (Booking.com) to confirm this. He told me to connect to the Wfi and check my emails. I had no further emails, just the one confirming after I had placed the booking. I am also surprised that a hotel as near to a main railway station has such and early finish to a check in. I wonder how many more are hit by this additional cost. I would also like to add that on arrival we needed to take the lift to the 4th floor and it wouldnt work unless you put coinage in (which we didnt have). The room was very basic with a fridge in it with chargeable costs (no surprise there), but the water bottles were totally frozen with ice. The breakfast was 2 coissants with a small glass of coffee. There was no one to check us out so we just left our keys. Very disappointing all round. Plus, trying to get Booking.com to even respond is not good aftercare at all. I can see that in previous messages they ask people to contact them via their Facebook page which I also have done, and 5 days on I am still waiting for the courtesy of an acknowledgement hence the poor star rating.        	                7	1	Thursday	booking	neutral
1525	            Made a reservation for 9 nights at Plaza Santa Ponsa Boutique Hotel in Majorca, made a payment £1257.74 online via Booking.com, within a couple of minutes my bank contacted me via a text to inform me that £1311.66 and then a further amount of over £400 pounds was attempted to be taken, I informed my bank to stop any payments to this payee, which I thought they had. After many attempted phone calls with no answer and number not in use I emailed them through the Booking.com port hole, 5 emails sent with no reply, last email sent I informed them that if I don't get a response within the hour I would be not continuing with the booking. They never replied so I had to make reservations else where, today I receive a txt from my bank informing me they have taken £1304.40 via my debit card😡. Contacted Booking.com and they apparently emailed the hotel and the hotel have said no refund will be given because I never cancelled, which I did 7 days before my reservation date. Booking.com have just given up and as far as they are concerned that's the end of it. Make a wise choice and use someone like Travel Republic.I look at this as fraud, but according to my bank, because I attempted to make a payment with my debit card which was stopped but then the hotel tried again 7 days later it's not and now I'm out of pocket by some £1304.40.Bank let me down, booking.com let me down and the worst of the was PLAZA SANTA PONSA BOUTIQUE HOTEL        	                1	1	Thursday	booking	negative
1526	            Even though I have used booking.com for a long time now this is the first time I am truly disappointed. I booked a room in august for a leasure trip and they phoned me 1 week before my stay saying my room was unavailable and I needed to book another one. Three times as much! They said I will be refunded the difference 2 weeks after my stay. I do what they advised me to and when I got to the hotel I was truly disappointed by the conditions vs the money I had to pay. They were charging me close to 200 pounds for a 5 nights stay in a hotel with bugs and non-working wifi. I decided to cut my vacation short and leave that hotel after one of the receptionists was quite rude. I don't want any of their refunds but an apology would be preferable.  And on top of that the receptionist of the other place calls me in the middle of the night to ask me if I am still coming. I think I was definitely the victim of a con.

1527	            I'm admittedly not internet savvy so clicked on the first search result for an area's accommodation options. I had thought the provider must pay a one-time listing fee as I wouldn't have agreed to a 12% hidden commission cost paid when all Booking.com did was refer the booking, which disturbingly included forwarding my presumed confidential credit card details! The actual accommodation provider was excellent but explained how these global third-party agents now secretly rebate portions of their 12% commission to offer alleged lower rates than what even the provider is allowed to as a condition of their listing which the provider feels forced to join for its competing financial survival.        	                1	1	Thursday	booking	negative

Now, five weeks before I travel they have taken money from my English bank account when I profusely said I wanted a Thai Baht rate, which they gave. My credit card was used as a guarantee only, but by using it I have incurred additional charges for a non sterling purchase fee and a non sterling transfer fee, plus a further loss on the exchange rate. As both website and confirmation say pay at the hotel, taking my £ Sterling money from me five weeks beforehand and against my instructions that I pay in Thai Baht is tantamount to fraud. I would like to hear what they have to say about it.Re: Your reply. Where does one find your 'terms and conditions', they are not on the printed confirmation. The booking ref. has also been passed to Mercure Hotels head office and to my bank. Report me if you like (to whom?) but your offence is far greater than mine.Please tell me also where it says ' the cost is charged by the property right away' on the booking confirmation?

The person I spoke to was so unhelpful and the whole process was so distressing. I was told i couldn't be refunded and it was company policy and that's it. I am so upset I can't afford to lose that amount of money and can now not go as planned as I can not pay twice. It was a genuine error and I called them straight away.        	                1	1	Monday	booking	negative

1538	            I have booked thruogh booking.com a few times now and have no problems with bookings. I just wish sometimes it would give more information on payments for places. I get non refundable but some places take payment on booking, some when your leaving and some take half before. If like me you book ahead it can make you wonder why some money has gone out your account all of a sudden on the latter especially when you haven't used your card at that time and its an amount your not expecting to pay i.e. if they had taken the full amount I may have worked out what it was for.        	                3	4	Sunday	booking	neutral
1539	"            Booked an apartment through booking.com - never again! Completely different to the pictures on the website. There was vomit on the stairs on the way up, dirt and mould all over the apartment, doors that wouldn't close properly, radiators hanging off walls, no proper beds, tiles falling off the walls and flies all over the kitchen. The smell was rancid and when combined with the mould left us feeling ill and short of breath after 20 minutes. The whole place was a health hazard and cost over €300 for one night.I called the owner who refused to meet us, offer any alternative accomodation or a refund. He became abusive, hanging up the phone and finally stated ""if [we] had paid more money we could have afforded a better place."" The apartment was so disgusting we couldn't stay there and had to find alternative accomodation. It was very stressful and ruined our weekend.We have also complained to booking.com. At first they suggested we should read the reviews, however this was unhelpful considering when the accomodation was booked none of the reviews had been posted! They have now offered €70 compensation which we are unwilling to accept. I have asked again and again for booking.com to confirm who the contract for the accomodation is with but have been led a merry dance. One email states booking.com is an intermediate but another states that the contract is with booking.com! It is so frustrating to still not have any confirmation after a month of dealing with the company.        "	                1	1	Saturday	booking	negative
1540	            I have used booking.com once and I will never do it again. We had to cancell the trip in the last minute. I was trying to cancel the reservation. Hotel was refering to booking and booking to hotel, no one was willing to talk to us and help. We have paid the full price for 3 days accomodation in Verona. I would understand some cancelation fee, but the worst experiance was that it is not possible to talk to someone and agree some reasonable solution.

1542	            I booked a hotel in Poland for the agreed  price of £574 (2716 polish) for 2 rooms. It took 3 attempts for the monies to be taken over a 2 week period (not my fault the card failed and no reason given) only to find out I was charged £588 plus £17.50 from my bank for the exchange rate because I was charged from Poland. What booking.com don't tell you is that it's all on a live exchange rate so even though I  agreed to pay £574, by the time the money was eventually taken from my account the sterling rate had dropped so it has cost me £588 plus the bank charges. The price and rate of exchange should be honoured at the time of booking and that's the price you should pay!!!Customer service appalling!! 1st customer service representative put the phone down on me when I explained my situation. 2nd customer service representative kept calling me 'darling', couldn't answer my questions and then put the phone down on me.        	                5	1	Friday	booking	negative
1543	"            Booked a room on their site, first time I have been charged a 'cleaning fee' of 39 euros which is hidden in the small print away from the 'total charge' fee when booking. This is not made clear at the payment stage, it magically appears after you have received the confirmation from the hotel (which is of course non-refundable). Disgusting hidden charge. Previously used Booking.com regularly. Not again.Update in response: yes, I did speak to customer services, the fee ""is quite clearly stated in the SMALL print"" however, it is not displayed in the TOTAL amount of payment requested at the time of booking. Very misleading. Customer services most unhelpful, said it was up to me to check. I booked over 100 properties with you... never again.        "	                14	1	Thursday	booking	negative

1545	            Made the mistake of booking through them twice. The first time they didn't even put the bloody booking through so we had to pay extra money and wasted half a day of our holiday! The second time we had booked an apartment and they gave us one room with 5 beds in it, clearly not what I asked for. Again, we had to pay extra and wasted a full day of our holiday, looking for a hotel that would be able to fulfil our requirements. Terrible customer service on top of all of that. An advisor had the nerve to start an argument with me when I called about my booking. Overall, I definitely will not be using this stupid website again! Booking.com?

Not only did we loose our flight and vacation, there has been so much more at loss. We asked booking.com and the hotel Punta Azul if the least they could do is provide us with a full refund due to the uncontrollable, horrific situation at hand.

We were travelling with friends who were celebrating their 30th Wedding Anniversary. Thankfully their room was as advertised but ours was a cramped, single room with 2 beds pushed together to pass it off as a double.  We were charged the same price for 2 very different rooms.We couldn't complain on site as our friends were always present and we didnt want to make them feel uncomfortable.  When I contacted Booking.com to inform them they were no help - just talked about price value trade-offs! More like price value rip offs.        	                2	1	Tuesday	booking	positive
1553	"            We have last week booked an apartment, that was advertised as 45€, after processing the payment, that price increased to 75€- with no explanation whatsoever. Only later did we find out, that Booking.com added a ""cleaning fee"", which they list in the small print at the very end of the apartment's description. We tried to cancel that booking, but were told that it was not possible, and the cleaning fee has to be paid as well. It is not understandable, why Booking.com does not include it in the price they advertise right on the first line of the apartment's price and description. In my opinion, this is deceitful and improper business practice next to stealing.        "	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	negative
1554	            In the last month I had only bad experiencies with them.

As a travel I got charged by an apartment, who did not come for check in time and let us in, but he charged us afterwards anyway. Booking doesnt even try to help and even though we gave evidence we were there and called the owner its our fault! so no dont choose booking in anyway!

I made a reservation for my son and I in a 4 star hotel in Paris. When we arrived there we did not want to get out of the car, it was in a very dangerous zone and nothingh even close to a 1 star hotel in view. The place we had reserved was full with roaming homeless shooting crack in the very steps of the lobby.

Second adviser just as understanding and called to chase the hotel for a resolution. Within minutes he was back on the line with a resolution that is exactly what i was looking for.

1561	"            I booked an apartment advertised as buy now pay later.  I was subsequently surprised to find out that I had been charged for the booking.  i would never have booked this property had it not been so advertised.When a friend i had booked the apartment for was unable to go I canceled the booking.  when i realised how much the charge was(£300) I tried to uncancel - they refused even though i made the uncancel request by email and phone within 30 min of the cancellation request on a sunday morning.  The hotel had a policy of 50% cancellation fee even through the booking was made a week previously.  Booking.com's supervisor felt this was fair even though this is totally different cancellation policy from other properties advertised and indeed booked by myself via booking.com.  The booking terms and cancellation rates were not on the online confirmation.  There were cancelation details clearly displayed for the other 4 properties id booked for this trip via book.com.They hide beyond unfair and unclear terms and conditions and have a rude approach to customer service.  You have been warned!Just an update following the response from booking.com on this page and outcome of my complaint to the CEO - i underwent a law degree for four years - if i did not ""see"" these alleged clearly defined cancellation policies then the average person would not have.  I was extremely disappointed with the outcome of my grievance to the CEO - they made no attempt to respond to my points and certainly have not done anything other that to allegedly contact the owner to see if they would reconsider.  this indicates their attitude to customer service when things go wrong i.e its not my problem.  I also have a copy of a confirmation email (which conveniently disappeared online after i cancelled the booking) and clearly shows no reference to this cancellation policy or that money would be taken upfront.  I'm in the process of requesting a subject access request and will be exploring my legal routes - one thing they don't tell you is that they deny they are bound by our uk laws *eg sale of goods act) which are superior to the norwegian ones they reference.  my friends and family no longer use them following my experience - there are plenty of other sites which are cheaper with clear cancellation policies and better customer service record.  A pity as i had been using them for several years.  Re the request to contact booking.com my grievances have not been investigated in any way - however they have been raised twice inc directly to the CEO.  I have contacted booking.com in response to this message on facebook however i have little hope this will be resolved.

Long history short I started a claim with booking.com they said the were going to looked at the situation and someone were going to called me (whis I am still waiting weeks later, lol).

The staff were rude beyond belief . They were upset when we asked for someone to look at our a/c unit. The key cards had to be reprogrammed daily which apparently is a norm.  It was filthy !

Fortunately I read the entire email to notice this sneaky change. When I questioned this with the hotel they said that it was a Booking.com matter. When I questioned this with their customer services team they said I made the wrong booking and if I wanted all inclusive I had to pay more which was significantly more than I was prepared to pay. It took them a week to eventually respond and they were still not prepared to honour their initial offer.

1575	            The website itself is fine. The service I have received from the Booking.com team and company is woefully poor.I cancelled my reservation for a hotel on 6th July 2017 (It's now August 21st) and I still have not received my full refund which I am entitled to.First of all, why are you using such poor hotels who do not refund the customer when they have legitimately cancelled within the specified time period? I had provided all proof necessary to show that I am due a full refund. Both the hotel and booking.com have sent me emails acknowledging that I am entitled to my full refund.Next, after several phone calls over several weeks, booking.com finally state that they will issue me my entitled refund themselves as the hotel 'have not provided a satisfactory solution'. I received an email on 15th August from booking.com saying that my case has been forwarded onto the customer relations team. The email states someone will contact me as soon as possible about my case. Two days later (17th Aug), I still haven't received any phone call or email so I called them up to ask when 'as soon as possible will be'. I was informed over the phone by a booking.com agent that someone from the customer relations team will call or email me within the next two days (which will be by 19th Aug). It is now the 21st Aug. As I have been lied to I called booking.com yet again today. First, the agent told me I had been sent an email by customer relations team asking for my card details in order for them to refund me. I stated to him that I had not received any email and I also checked my junk folder and there was no email asking for card details for a refund there either. I asked the agent to send the email again. After being put on hold the agent said to me that he just spoke to the customer relations team and they said that it will take up to 14 days for my case to be reviewed and subsequently an email asking for my details to be sent to me. I had been lied to a second time. An email has not been sent to me already despite what the agent said before speaking to customer relations team. Furthermore, it's already been a month and a half now it's going to take another 14 days for me to get an email asking for my details so that I can be refunded! Not even 14 days until the money is in my account! What a joke! Never in my life have I experienced such unprofessional and shocking customer support! At no point did I ever receive a phone call from booking.com to inform me that it takes 14 days etc, all phone conversations were initiated by myself - the customer who just wants his refund back. Please address the poor service your team has given me before another customer is negatively affected in future similar cases.        	                2	1	Monday	booking	negative

We are supposed to get 100% payment in both cases but we get ZERO because booking.com does not chase the money and provides only an internal email address by which we can try to contact the guest to try to recover payment (which of course would be unsuccessful anyway).  booking.com will not collect prepayment or release credit card information or charge the guests' credit card.

1590	            Hi, I have booked with them several hotels in SE Asia. The whole advertising from this website is misleading and false and I had also other issues. - pictures are not accurat, absolutely misleading. Sometimes a difference like day and night to the real thing.- they offer the price difference if you find the same accommodation anywhere else cheaper -- didn't happen -- sent 2 claims from 2 different websites -- response came after a week, after I sent a reminder and then for sure the prices of the other 2 websites where adjusted or they did not have many rooms left so they raised the prices (or it seems to me they work together).- got a confirmation but the hotel was fully booked -- no refund for the difference I had to pay for a more expensive stay.- got a few email responses from a manager with no name!! -- that tells me everything.- I have checked probably about 300 hotels and read the reviews -- but there were only a couple with negative reviews. At other sites you can read all reviews, at booking.com not -- why is that? So if you write a negative review of a hotel, it doesn't matter as it will not be published anyway. So, all in all -- No more Booking.Com - That's it!Jay        	                3	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

When asked to speak with somebody higher or a manager they refused to do so leaving my friend in tears to then be hung up on!! The service is vile and I highly advice anyone to NEVER book anything with these people!!!!!  Basically she has paid hundreds of pounds to a hotel she's not even staying at.

1597	            Ok - reading through a lot of these reviews, booking.com is being held accountable for issues that are the fault of the rental property or venue.  Booking.com offers reviews for you to see prior to booking (and even if you aren't sure, you can also double check TripAdvisor).  And if for those who wanted to cancel but booked a non-refundable policy - that's why it's non-refundable!I have used booking.com for trips all over the world (Vietnam, Japan, Korea, Costa Rica, Australia, Austria, etc..) and I have never had a problem.  I was able to always easily cancel and rebook if I found a better property (as long as I was within cancellation policy).  And no problems checking in or hotels finding my reservation.  Also booking.com tends to have the best pricing of all the sites and the widest selection (which sometimes also includes b&amp;bs, apartment rentals).  I'd recommend booking.com to everyone.        	                1	5	Tuesday	booking	positive

I immediately sent an email to Booking and they didnt answer.The next day I called and was advised by a service rep to ""not worry, send a proof of the discount and we will match the price"". We agreed on the call that the proof of discount will be a screen shot of the offer details. 2 days later I get an email asking for proof of the deal again. I sent it again in the different format they asked for. Nothing back. 2 days later I called and had a few conversations with their service reps, ending with an email back from them that I am not entitled to the price match because of technicalities. In the mean time the special offer was sold out and I lost it...If they had let me know this on the first call and allowed me to cancel the order I could have saved a ton on this vacation. Plus the whole service experience was very bad - they didnt respond on time, I had to call in a few times, each time educate a new person on the issue...and even though I specifically asked to speak to a manager I never got through.

On booking it was clear that the single room for our son was not adjoining but on checking, it was also not even near our room. Despite numerous calls and emails this was not corrected. To make matters worse, we then agreed direct with the hotel that we would continue with our room and with extra beds in - it then turns out that the original prices for was 2 adults only and that if we include the children it will now  cost an extra €1000. So summary, an extra €1000 to get what we already thought we had and so much hassle and stress that it has completely taken the shine of the stay. Bookings (once I finally got through!!) were useless and ineffective and suggested by 9 year olds sleeps in a cot to get around the rules of the hotel!!.

I recommend always reading your hotel policies before booking as some hotels are very different and have different rules. As of recently I was traveling in the Philippines and I had booked a fairly expensive resort using booking.com last minute, (the day before check in) and just out of curiousity I looked up the resort again a few hours later and seen that the exact same resort was a lot cheaper on another site I have used previously. Well I emailed booking.com that day with the link to the other booking and got a response that SAME DAY. They were going to review my claim and sure enough within 24 hours my claim for their ""price match guarantee "" was approved. I received my refund into my account within 4 days! Very incredible customer service and they own up to their price match as long as it fits the criteria which you can find on the website. Thanks Booking.com!

1608	            Something to know for all people who book through this, and other, booking websites.1/ Very good at enticing customers with 'Deals'. There is no such thing! They just write that so that you book through them. For example, they may say '50% cheaper'. Absolute rubbish... They basically take the price of a room and do several things a) they compare the most expensive room to the cheapest room in a hotel and lo and behold they have found you a room 50% cheaper! or b) they compare the price of a room at the height of the season and the low of the season, and once again they claim they have got you the room cheaper!2/ No booking fees or Credit card fees. Well the average person reads that as 'I will not be charged anything at booking time'! Be aware it says exactly what it says, you will not be charged extra for booking through them, and you will not have a charge for using a credit card; that's all that means! You need to check (surprise surprise they hide these facts very cleverly) if the hotel will take a deposit from you or if it will take the full amount of the booking up front.3/ Free cancellation. This is a doozy... again it means what it says. if you cancel, it wont cost you a charge to cancel; that's all that means!!! be very careful here as the terms and conditions of cancellations or no-shows are wide and varied between hotels; and once again our 'trusted' B.scum will hide these very well! You may end up losing your deposit or full amount that you have paid.4/ have you ever tried to call their cutomer services? good luck there. they will only liaise with the hotel to sort anything out. Yes that's right B.scum have no say in what happens to your booking when it is done. they just take the commission from the hotel and you are left to fend with the hotel afterwards. If there is an issue and you complain enough they may pay you back; but trust me that its the hotel that ends up paying this bill as they just pass it on. If the hotel refuses to pay B.scum, they just penalise the hotel by a) not showing the hotel on your search list or b) actually say that the hotel is full when it actually is not! So again they are not providing you with all the information you are trying to search for when trying to book for your holiday.Basically, make sure you read everything properly as B.scum have one and only one goal, to make money out of commissions; they are not here to provide you with a great holiday.reccomendations are to do a quick research on tripadvisor (owned by Expedia by the way) and CALL THE HOTEL DIRECTLY! Most hotels should be cheaper if booked directly, and if theyre not, then just tell them you have seen a better price on whatever website and they should comply; unless of course you prefer to spend more for something you can get cheaper...By the way, for those who say one website is better than another. Well just be aware that:Booking.com owns and distributes its prices through opodo, priceline, roomdi.com, elvoline; to name a few.Expedia owns and distributes through Laterooms, hotels.com to name a few.So you think you have a choice but theyre actually the same thing!        	                5	1	Thursday	booking	positive

In principle I was reluctant to pay but their communication was very slow and there was no attempt to reach a compromise. It was take it or leave it attitude.. For a company that makes a mistake and then offers no compromise to the customer shows how they hold their customers in contempt.

No where in the reservation process, does it say that is what it will cost you.  I called the hotel - they say they saw the reservation, but no cancellation.   They would be happy to refund my money if booking.com calls them. I called booking.com, the Customer Service Agent, says ""sure I can help you with that!"" I thought great what good company to deal with - I was put on a hold for about 5-7 minutes, while she was ""calling"" the Hampton Inn, she gets back on the line and tells me I can expect a refund.

1614	            I've used Booking.com for several years and am a 'genius' member. I booked 2 rooms at Novotel Birmingham Airport prior to a flight in June 2017. They were non-refundable. A month before we knew we would only need one room and would forfeit £99 for it. However on checking out Novotel informed us that we could have cancelled up to 14.00 the day before. I re-checked my booking email which stated non-refundable. I took up this discrepancy with Booking.com and their customer service was awful. They apparently 'reached out' (pahaha) to Novotel who confirmed my findings but ultimately said I had got what I paid for. Each email had to be chased up and took a week to arrive. Now £99 isn't a king's ransom but there's a principal at stake here. A mis-communication between third party and service providers which was not addressed. I didn't know I could have cancelled the room, otherwise I would have and saved myself £99. But Booking.com have shrugged their shoulders at a regular customer and denied any responsibility.

I was told only 24 hours before they arrived at the hotel that the first two nights were overbooked and that alternative accommodation would need to be found. The whole experience went down hill from here. I've been listening to hold music on the phone for hours, I've been told I would be called back and wasn't, then the final insult was to be offered only a partial refund and a good will gesture of €20.There are plenty of other competitors to use who hopefully have a more  ""customer first"" approach.

A couple of weeks after my booking I was deducted the full amount. First I went on their website to try to find an answer to this online. After I have not received an answer within two week I called them. Apparently I had done a mistake while booking, so I was not able to receive the coupon, which was not pleasant, but surely enough I could understand that. However, what really bothered me was that they had somebody who only spoke German broken and could not answer my questions. He literally asked me 3x to hold on for 10 minutes asking his colleagues what to reply to me.

They actually advertised a room at the Mr. Peyton Hotel in Grand Falls NL and we found out upon arrival that we had booked a smoking room at the not so nice MtPeyton Motel across the road! Disgusting tactics! The hotel totally blamed Booking.com and we were stuck with the rooms because they had nothing else available and all other accommodations in the town were full. We paid 150.00 for an old, ugly room that reeked of smoke. The picture showed a beautiful bed with lots of pillows and nice white bedding. We got a bed with a 1970's flowered bedspread and two lumpy pillows. Nice for my young children, grandma and us!        	                1	1	Saturday	booking	negative
1623	            Website unclear I booked what I thought were apartments with no cancellation fee then tried to book flights and couldn't get any to suit dates.Cancelled within 24 hours and got charged £121 from hotel supposedly. I'm really disappointed with Tisalaya Park Gran Canadian be very wary as on their website it says you can cancel up until day before without charge.Why is policy different on booking.com ? Still waiting a week later for email from both booking.com and Tisalaya park and nothing back, not a good service and feel duped by policy.        	                3	1	Saturday	booking	negative
1624	            Stayed in Sea Valley Biddeford bay. It was totally awful. Dirty, cold damp, no heating had been on for weeks. It was a hole. No wifi.We arrived late at night so had no choice but to stay. We left the following day. We were told we could have a refund. It has taken 3 months of calling up. We have just been told we will get a refund. So poor. No compensation for the amount of time we wasted and the fact our long weekend was ruined.Unable to write a review on their site as we cancelled it!One hour today on the phone trying to deal with it.        	                1	1	Saturday	booking	negative
1625	            I booked a fully-refundable hotel room in February 2017 for a one night stay in Dubai in September 2017, as my flight from Sri Lanka to London involved an overnight stopover in Dubai.The entire reason why I booked 7 months in advance rather than waiting until nearer the time was because the website said the booking could be cancelled free of charge any time up until the day before, so there seemed to be no harm in making the booking straight away. The confirmation email I received straight after making the booking did say in the small print that the booking was non-refundable, however, I did not see this at the time. (Being a lawyer, I read the small print BEFORE making the booking, not afterwards, and I did not expect the terms to change.)A few months later our airline changed the time of our return flight, and as a result, we no longer have an overnight stopover in Dubai. I immediately logged on to Booking.com to cancel the reservation, because I did not want to forget to cancel and end up accidentally being charged. However, when I received my credit card bill, I realised that I had been charged for the entire cost of the booking including local taxes etc.Booking.com are now denying that the room was ever advertised as non-refundable and are suggesting that I am either lying or confused. Frankly, this is an insult to my intelligence.Their most useful advice to me was that if I had taken a screen shot of their website before I clicked to confirm my booking, I would be able to prove that the room was advertised as being fully refundable. Funnily enough, I did not do so because I thought Booking.com was a respectable and legitimate company and did not anticipate having to prove that I was telling the truth.This advice is of no use to me since I do not plan to ever use Booking.com again, but it may be of use to anyone else brave enough to use them.Personally I would avoid. Just awful.        	                3	1	Friday	booking	negative

An email to contact at booking.com did only return a std answer, about a reference number, so I conclude it has not been taken serious.One of my complaints is beyond the terrific studio apartment in strasbourg, Austerlitz, is that they were allowed to make an 100 % cleaning fee above the rent for the studio. If this fee were included in the search parameters, I had chosen a decent Hotel with breakfast for the same money.

Plus they have this book now pay later-you need a bank card to confirm booking. Well that's a scam too.

I did that, and returned to find out that they refused to cancel the reservation and I was now out EVEN MORE MONEY because I stayed at a different hotel. Another phone call did not remedy this. Someone who is looking at cheap hotels can't afford to be unexpectedly charged $370 for no reason.

Although it was a non-refundable booking, they offered the option that they would contact the hotel and ask if they are prepared to cancel my booking.   Within a few minutes of me submitting the email, I received a reply that the hotel had declined to cancel my booking and had taken the payment from my credit card.I was rather suspicious about how quickly this had happened and phoned the hotel directly.  They said that Booking.com had failed to tell them why I was requesting a cancellation which is why they rejected it.Once I had explained the reason, they immediately agreed to cancel my booking, refund my card and even offered to give me a better deal when I am able to re-book the training course.So top marks to the hotel, the White Hart in Harrogate and shame on you Booking.Com for extremely poor service both to myself and the hotel.That's the last time I will use them!        	                6	1	Monday	booking	negative

Just a tiny, dirty little room with none of the facilities mentioned: no tv , no Wi-Fi, no air-conditioning. All the furniture is very old and damaged, the refrigerator is full of rust, the pillows were dirty and everything is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!! It is not only unacceptable but also Outrageous!!!!!!! There were ants all over the room, on the bed!!!!!!! I was scared to touch anything because of how bad and dirty everything looked. On top of even though the terms and conditions mentioned that I will pay at the hotel and no money will be charged in advance, they debited my credit card almost one month in advance, without my permission! When I called to complain about the hotel, one of the representatives from booking offered me an alternative hotel and promised they will deal with the hotel for my refund. One month passed and tenths of minutes spent over the phone with booking.com, promises that they will refund my money and nothing! Now, they hang up on me because the only thing they are willing to do is to offer me some money as “a good will gesture”! I don’t need a good will gesture, I need booking.com to refund the money they fraudulently taken from my credit card. This is not the first time I hear about people arriving at the accommodation and having no reservation! Such a practice from booking.com happened before to other people too, so watch out!

When it comes to their ability to accommodate for a last minute cancellation, due to ""technical problems"" they are quick to find what they call and equal comp. Unfortunately, in my experience it was anything but equal. My booking in London was cancelled 12 hours before my party was suppose to arrive. Their suggested comp (which we did quickly book seeing that we had no place to stay) was a 4th floor unit without A/C and required us to pickup the keys at a different location than where we needed to check in as well as a later check in time. Much different than the 1st floor unit with A/C and an earlier check in time that we had booked. This resulted in an uncomfortable and inconvenient stay which caused us to miss a $70 tour that we had already booked. When we contacted booking.com to discuss all of the issues we encountered, they informed us that they couldn't and wouldn't do anything for us.        "	                2	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

It is now 24th July and after me calling again  they have told me that apparently my money has been refunded and that I should check my statements in the next couple of days and if nothing I should contact my bank to see (wasting more of my time). I asked to speak to a manager to complain about the poor customer service and was told that they wouldn't speak to me as as far as they are concerned the case is closed. I have used them before but never again as the customer service is very poor. Beware  that free cancellation may mean that the money is taken anyway and you will have to prove this wasting your time   Still waiting to see if the money has actually been refunded a month and half after it had been taken .        	                2	1	Monday	booking	neutral
1671	            I booked through a stay at a hotel for two nights, but when I arrived the booking weren't in their system. I called customer service to get my reservation moved. The even told me, that they were aware that it didn't go through, but apparently didn't find it necessary to tell me. We got moved to the worst hotel in the area, and nothing in compensation. If you don't want your vacation ruined, then stay away from this excuse of a booking app        	                6	1	Monday	booking	negative

1674	            Non only are so many of the cancellation fees and small print done in such a way you find out the hard way. The extra costs are always at the end after you've chosen it and try to book it. It's such a rip off. Secondly never once have I had any of my special requests seen to. In fact one seems to get the noisiest rooms in the worst location of the hotel. It's the last time I book with them. From now on, I just contact the hotel directly like I used to. Interestingly enough it is often cheaper this way and the extra costs are not hidden and you can discuss any special requests and cancellation fees directly.        	                37	2	Saturday	booking	positive

1679	            I booked a hotel in Atlanta, USA with Booking.com and on arrival the hotel had no knowledge about my booking. This necessitated me making a 32 minute mobile phone call to them to try ton resolve the problem they had left me with. Most of that call which cost me £33 was waiting for them to answer. When they did they were pretty useless. The hotel got fed up with them and sorted me a room out anyway. They offered to reimburse me the cost of the call but when I sent a copy of my bill they only offered £15. I said no and I wanted the FULL amount. Despite sending them a reminder, they haven't replied. Terrible service, beware.        	                3	1	Thursday	booking	neutral

I found the same room on the same dates with Expedia but for £50 less. I sent them all the details under their price match promise but they refused to price match even though I had proved beyond doubt that it was £50 cheaper. I ended up cancelling and costing me 55 euros and booked with Expedia. They are a disgrace and their patronising emails really take the cake.

I was charged foreign transaction fees!The site is a joke. What they say at the time of booking suddenly changes once you've reserved - customer service is atrocious - you wait for 20 minutes to get through and they don't help        	                15	1	Sunday	booking	negative
1685	"            Terrible Customer service from Booking.comBooked a hotel in London, Earls Court Gardens Hotel for two nights at the end of April, booked through Booking.com and paid for this through Paypal.The hotel was awful, bed bugs, mouse trap, warped window that didn't shut. Complained to both the hotel and Booking.com and it was agreed that we would get a refund for one night.  Well here we are in July and no refund. I emailed them both most days and most days did not even get a reply. The hotel sent me an email of a refund receipt to a Master Card, however my payment was made by a Visa Card and went through Paypal. I sent both Booking.com and the hotel a copy of the payment receipt to show that the refund did not go back to my card or even my bank account and still nothing.  I contacted Paypal also but as there was nowhere that I could raise the complaint other than goods not as described, Paypal said ""During our review, we found that your seller had sufficiently described the merchandise"" and ""If you wish to pursue this issue, we encourage you to contact your seller directly for resolution"", so much for Paypal Protection.  I did explain to Paypal that they refunded to the wrong account, it was Booking.com gave this account number etc to the hotel.  I have an email from Booking.com telling me I paid by Master card and I replied with the payment receipt again showing Visa card and they have ignored that email also.  I will probably never use Booking.com again and most certainly would never recommend them to anyone.  Shame on you Booking.com, I really don't know how you cannot see the mess you made when1. I email you with a copy of the receipt for a refund to a Master Card account,2. an email from Booking.com saying I paid for the booking with a virtual Master Card3.

1686	            Booking.com they tell you what you want to hear but what about what you actually need? Well in my opinion they won't do that!I will start by saying I have been in Florida for the past six years and I have always used villa's. The first year I used a travel agent and booked the whole package and the following five years booked my holiday independently via airlines, car hire company and villa owners or agents. For the first four years of this self booking I have to say my experience of villa owners and agents was excellent and the villa's were always to or above the standard expected.Now sadly this is where it starts to go wrong. In November 2016 just as I was preparing to book this years trip I heard a few stories from various sources about substandard and double booked villa's. I decided to look at using a larger organisation  to hopefully offer some protection. Now when I say who I booked the villa through a lot of people will now say that it's hardly surprising but to be fair at the time their reputation was fine and I had used them for other short breaks with positive a experience.So after looking around at a few of the larger organisations I found a villa on Booking.com. It was a named villa supplied by an organisation called The Orlando Villa Network. The price was similar to all the others I looked at but as it gave a villa location which I liked I decided it ticked all the right boxes. I booked on the 25th November 2016 and the payment for the villa was taken from my account on the 28th November. Due to a number of other unrelated issues I never noted that I had not received any confirmation from The Orlando Villa Network. I used Booking.com message service to contact the company raising my concerns eventually in May I received an e-mail saying that everything was fine. This still left me uneasy so I escalated my concerns to Booking.com who told me it was fine. Now as all of the villa users will know you would expect to get either key box or office information prior to your arrival. This never arrived and I again tried to contact both The Orlando Villa Network and Booking. Com with no answers being forthcoming. I was left in the position where the night before my departure I had no information and now had to try and get a definitive answer from Booking.com. This was not possible as the didn't understand villa's and they just presumed that the property I was going to was a hotel and due to the limited English of the call handlers I could not get my concerns to be understood. So we arrive in Orlando pick up the car and head to the address supplied by Booking.com and yes you have guessed it was already inhabited by an American family and yip you guessed it too they had also booked through Booking.com and showed me their documentation. The only difference was that there was no mention of The Orlando Villa Network! Now at this point I contact Booking.com and they eventually after 2 hours get me the details of another property however they will not book it, I have to do it through the app. The next problem is I cannot get into this property until the following morning so have to stay overnight at a motel. So I am guessing that you experienced readers will realise that I have now paid out a additional $100 for my motel and an additional $1500 for my accommodation plus call and data charges of $300.So what did Booking.com do to rectify the situation? The answer is simple! Nothing we lost a full first day, spent an additional $2000, were stressed out beyond belief and Booking.com have done nothing! I have been promised in e-mails that all out of pocket expenses reimbursed, this hasn't happened. They promised I would get original payments to The Orlando Villa Network back, this has not happened! Oh and I never asked to be compensated for the stress of it all, I didn't ask to be better off as a result of Booking.com! All I want is my money back and I will take the fact that I have learned not to use Booking.com ever again as compensation enough!Please don't read this and think that I claim not to have made a mistake myself by not pushing harder but also please don't ignore and think that it will never happen to you because you know what you are doing! I have spent two weeks emailing and calling this organisation and wondering whether I will ever see the $2000 back! I can promise you this though Booking.com I will either get my out of pocket expenses back or I will post on every holiday page I can find about your incompetence, I will write to papers and will make sure that people know that you are not only happy to wreck people's holidays you do not even want to try and fix it when given every opportunity!        	                1	1	Saturday	booking	positive
1687	            On July 10, 2017,  my flight to Europe cancelled from the USA, due to a building fire in the air traffic control center.  The flight was reinstated for 25 hours later, but by then, my entire vacation in Europe had been interrupted, thus making it impossible for me to travel.  I called booking.com to cancel my 2 nights in Austria.  I spoke with a representative named Sarina.  She supposedly contacted the hotel directly and said they would only refund me 50% of the total cost of the 2 nights.  I asked to speak to her supervisor named Angeliki, and was denied.  It is shameful that booking.com doesn't have a policy to refund money spent on rooms booked, even if the supposed hotel won't  refund, due to circumstances beyond anyone's control.  Please be aware that if you can't travel due to circumstances beyond your control, that you will still be charged for your hotel rooms booked.  I will never use booking.com ever again due to this lack of customer service and lack of protection to their customers.  Buyer beware!!!!        	                2	1	Saturday	booking	negative

1690	            I've used Booking.com in the past without issue but if you have a problem,  you're screwed! My son and I took a West coast road trip in June.  We planned on going to Yosemite National Park and wanted lodging close by.  Pulled up Mammoth Lakes area via Trivago.com and found an awesome ski resort called Juniper Springs.   Booking.com had a specific unit, Mount view listed at a price  $15 lower than the other companies (Priceline, Hote l so, etc) so I booked it using my Mastercard.  Arrived at Juniper Springs after a 10 hr drive from San Francisco to find I had no reservation on file yet my card had a $312 charge from somewhere called Vacaystay Stay.  Juniper Springs tried to help locate owner of #347, the room Booking.com listed.  No owner listed, no lock box, no key and phone looped back to resort.   Wound up having to rent another room and pay again for it.  Called booking.com and got woman with limited English who said I couldn't speak to a manager because they don't deal with customers.   Several days go by, finally get email from booking.com asking for my credit card statement as proof.  Sent to them then nothing.   Called them when I got home and was told that they couldn't get a hold of Juniper Springs to confirm my story,  which is impossible as their front desk is open 24/7.  Obviously booking.com got scammed with a fraudulent listing and don't want to refund me and go after whomever scammed them.  It's now been a month and nothing has been done to refund me.  I am now having to go through the process of filing a fraud charge with my Mastercard.  Do yourself a favor and call hotel direct to book.  It's worth the extra few bucks for peace of mind!        	                1	1	Saturday	booking	negative

1692	            Poor service from booking.comAfter paying to secure an apartment in Camden, London,  I communicated with booking.com and with the 'host' repeatedly to try and get the exact location (google maps couldn't find it with the address provided) and where to collect keys. I never got a satisfactory response to numerous emails or phone messages before my departure. When I arrived in Camden I spent two hours searching the area where the apartment should have been. I knocked on doors, got waiters in a pub to re-google the address, etc. No one  had ever heard of the apartment block. One man had lived in the street for 10 years and had not heard about the London Lux Randolph apartments. Needless to say, at great expense and at 10pm I eventually checked into the closest Holiday Inn.  After numerous emails to booking.com I eventually received a written undertaking that I will be reimbursed but there has to date been no sign of the money and no response to three emails sent this week making enquiries. Needless to say, I will never use booking.com again.  After more than a month of many email communications, Booking.com has now promised to reimburse me for the money I paid for the accommodation and for the night I spent at the Holiday Inn. The money is not yet in my account, but I am optimistic. I will change my rating once the money appears.        	                1	1	Friday	booking	positive
1693	            Appalling service. I made a reservation a week in advance of my stay date. When I arrived at the hotel, they had no record of my stay. On calling booking support they were put on hold and in the end no resolution was given. It took an hour and a half to get to this point and find alternative accommodation. Because of this, I missed most of the event I had travelled halfway across the country for in the first place. Booking completely ruined my trip.When I returned home, I sent them a complaint. The first response was an automated email telling me someone would be in touch. I also sent them a copy of the invoice for the other hotel and told them I expected them to pay for it. A few days later, I chased them for the first time. No response. A few days after that, I chased them a second time. No response. Finally, I threatened to complain publicly on their twitter account, at which point I received an automatically generated email telling me that the difference between the hotels would be paid in the next 10 days. No human input, no offer of anything to compensate me for the rest of the trip that they ruined. No response when I chased them further.I will now be using booking as a hotel search engine and then using alternative travel sites, or the hotels' own websites to book my trip. I'd much rather pay a few pounds more for a room which will actually be there when I arrive, and to be treated like a valued customer.Oh, and two weeks later I still haven't received that refund.        	                4	1	Thursday	booking	negative

Less than 24 hours notice! They claim that my card has been declined, which it hasn't but they are happy for me re-book the room using another card. However we can't use the same booking so the room has now gone up in price by £125, funny that!!!        	                2	1	Thursday	booking	positive

1696	            Booking.com has always been my bible for booking trips. Recently, they just proved how professional they are. We booked a room for an apartment in Portugal. This was paid immediately by credit card in full. After 30 mins, we get a call from booking.com saying the owners made a mistake in the price and would like us to pay more. I told the booking.com rep that we would absolutely not pay one cent more than the advertised price. At this point, he was on hold with the apartment owner on the other line. The booking.com rep spoke to the owner of the apartment passing on our message. He came back to me after terminating the call with the apartment owner, saying that it was resolved and that the apartment owner would honour the agreed upon price. The booking.com rep was very professional and helpful throughout the whole call.The one thing I did not like is that they called us about it. The policy should never be to contact paying customers to resolve a mistake done by a hotelier or service provider.Other than that, great and reliable site.        	                1	4	Wednesday	booking	positive
1697	            Booked a hotel in Croatia for £1200. After booking this, I booked separate flights. A few days later, booking.com emailed to say they had made mistake in advertising the £1200 price and said I would have to pay £1100 extra!  As I hadn't paid a deposit I didn't have a leg to stand on.   They didn't answer any of my emails.  I ended up negotiating with the hotel owner directly and had to pay an extra £600 for a less-good hotel which we could ill-afford but the flights were already booked. I also had a terrible experience in a hotel a few years ago and they completely ignored me then as well. That can't be a coincidence.

1701	            Booked a three day break to Palma on booking.com and my friend booked exactly the same holiday but got it cheaper on Trivago. Because they claim to be the cheapest website and will refund the difference if you get it cheaper, I emailed and got no reply so emailed again but still have had no reply. There is a standard form to complete online which I eventually found but it would not allow me to submit the form even though all the boxes were ticked. Also it says in the small print that you only have 3 days to claim back the difference but because they did not reply to me I am now over that. I am so disappointed in them it will be the last time I use them.        	                13	1	Monday	booking	negative

Accommodation was refunded and Booking.com were only prepared to pay minimal expenses such as doctor and taxi as compensation.

1707	            I made a reservation with the site for a trip to Colombia. When I booked with  the property, it said FREE CANCELLATION, as in I should get a credit back to the card if I cancel. After I made the reservation, I was charged nearly 4 times what I booked for. 4 TIMES! I immediately cancelled the reservation and the property kept calling me and emailing me in Spanish, which I don't speak. After cancelling, I called booking.com and was told to submit proof of the charge. Fine...I do that. After that, I did not hear anything so I take the time to call and they said what I submitted wasn't enough. It had to have my name, address, card #. So I resubmit the statement when I got my bill. By this time it had been two weeks since I cancelled. The vendor refused to refund the money. So I call to follow up and I spoke with someone after waiting on for 30 minutes  said my card would get refunded. However, later that day, I get a call saying that I'll have to resubmit my card statement again. They didn't understand that it had been 3 weeks since I cancelled and that I was way overcharged! She then told me to call the property I booked with. SERIOUSLY? (wanted to write something else but it got censored lol) This was the worst experience I had. I would report them to the BBB. I called my credit card and they credited back the charge...should've done this way before. DO NOT USE THIS SITE! They have the worst customer service that will keep you on hold and string you around...maybe they were holding onto my funds as well. Never using this site again.        	                1	1	Friday	booking	negative

The hotel when we arrived did not have one window which was intact, all had cracks or even boards over them. We dare not get out of the car the hotel did not look open, we spoke to a local who confirmed if we left the cars over night they would not be there in the morning.

Motels have NO control of any changes, all I wanted to do was come a day early, no help, nothing! I will never use this site again!!

I have had no negative experiences at all with using the website or the mobile application. One thing I appreciate very much is being able to reserve rooms without having to pay a deposit and then to have considerable flexibility to cancel the booking again if plans change. I have both a personal and a 'business' account but I am not a business. I use it to separate bookings I make for holidays and those I make for professional reasons. I also have 'genius' status and while the name is perhaps a bit naff, I have managed to get some good deals because of this.        	                3	5	Saturday	booking	positive

We fled the property and immediately called Booking, expecting to be put up in a safe location and refunded for our stay. The representative we spoke to said she could only help us if she contacted the host (who had just assaulted my friend) and ask him for a refund, which he of course did not agree to. When I asked about where we could stay that night and if Booking would arrange something, they emailed me a link to a list of Booking properties in Dubrovnik that we would be responsible for reserving and paying for. When our host refused to cooperate with our wish to leave Booking emailed us saying ""We apologize that we were not able to help you further on this occasion"" I have been sickened by Booking's response to the assault that occurred in their unsafe location.

Either they have not received my mails or they are waiting for a respond from the hotel, who should not have receive the funds before my arrival or they want to see my bank statement as proof of payment...Why i don't know especially when my bank statement was not needed to debit my bank account during the booking process nor was it needed to send me a confirmation of my booking.Furthermore, the refund is been paid directly into the account it originated from, so why all the additional stumbling blocks??

Instead the full  £550 was taken from my account immediately and I was charged a £16.50 'international transaction fee'. Looking through Booking.com's confirmation email I found a line that said the hotel ""could take a prepayment up to the full amount at any time"". I was planning on using a card that didn't charge any fees so am furious at this duplicity. Will never use booking.com again.        "	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

1766	            Last December I booked a room at the Clayton Crown hotel in Cricklewood, London via Hotels.com for myself and a friend, since we had tickets to see Bob Dylan in Wembley on Tuesday the 9th of May 2017Both of us were travelling from different destinations in the UK. I paid with my American Express online. Even though I was aware that payment could be taken at anytime from my card, I was appalled to find that when I showed up at the hotel giving my name, they could not find me on the system.. As I produced the booking number, it showed that Booking.com had cancelled my reservation. What had happened was that I had lost my American Express card back in April and received a new one.Since I had booked the hotel quite a long time ago in December 2016 I had totally forgotten that I had used my Amex to pay for the hotel, and I am absolutely furious that Booking.com had cancelled my reservation and only contacted me via email, which I quite obviously did not see as this was not something I was expecting and had not seen. I did phone up Booking.com but they were of no help what so ever.Why on earth did they not try to phone me???????????????????????The irony of it all, is that I contacted Hotels.com a few weeks before arrival, to add my friends name to the  booking, in case she'd arrive before me and they replied saying that my message would be forwarded to the hotel in question. The least Booking.com could have done, was to contact me via my mobile phone  leaving a message. Shame on you!!!!!!!I'm so not impressed and will not use Booking.com ever again.        	                6	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

1768	"            As a travel writer, it is important to me to find the best, easiest ways to travel and share that with my readers. A few days ago, I was saying how easy and convenient I thought Booking.com was. Today, my opinion has (unfortunately) completely changed.I booked a hotel in Valemount, BC on Booking.com and received a confirmation email. However, when I arrived at the hotel, they told me they did not have my reservation. The hotel staff called Booking.com. Kristen, an employee at Booking.com, told me the ""booking failed to go through the hotel's system."" I told her I was never notified of this and showed up to no hotel room! I asked her to make sure I wouldn't be charged for the room I wasn't getting, and she said she could not guarantee that.Luckily, the hotel was nice enough to find a cancellation and give us their last room before putting on their ""No Vacancy"" sign. But what would have happened had there been no available rooms, or had we arrived later at night? The hotel clerk told me he had to deal with that exact scenario because of Booking.com the night before.In the future, Booking.com should alert customers if the hotel confirmation has not actually gone through. Customer service should also ensure the customer feels taken care of and is reassured that they will not be charged, because (as Kristen said) ""it is our [Booking.com's] mistake.""I am waiting to hear back from Booking.com and will update this review if they ensure I do not have to pay any other cancellation fees. Otherwise, look for my article about this experience.        "	                1	1	Sunday	booking	positive
1769	            We visited Dubrovnik on 21.04.2017. During our lunch we decided to stay in Dubrovnik and booked Apartmen Gloria for a night.The apartmen is advertised as providing parking. I have been to Dubrovnik before and I knew ther was no parking within the walls of the old city. However we were hoping that the owner had a parking somewhere outside the old city and he could offer us to park our car there. When we asked the owner about parking we were advised that he did not have parking but we would need to find one and ther were parking spaces available for 100 Euros a day. Rip off. We decided to get over it and find parking ourselves. Went to the address only to find out that there was nothing there but a building site. We emailed the owner standing outside the building site and were asked to call him. I called him imediately but he was not answering our calls. Of course, at that point we decided to cancell our booking and make reservation with somebody else. This was all within 40 minutes of making reservation.When we returned to London I contacted Booking.com. We were advised information that the accommodation does not provide parking is in the accommodatin details. We were offered 20 Euros compensation from Booking.com. The agent I spoke to promised he would speak to the owner and would investigate my claim that there is a building site at the address but we have not heard from them again. I wanted to find out why would somebody advertise that they provide parkingt only to be advised that the customers were left at their own devices. It is totally misleading. Yes, the detailed description does say we needed to find parking ourselves but when people go through the accommodation on the booking.com website they choose the one that advertises what they need. In this case Apartman Gloria in Dubrovnik provides WiFi, Parking etc. Why would you say you provide something only to say in the small print I am sorry you need to fend for yourself. I am writing this review because Booking.com still to this day has this apartment advertised as one that provides parking and it is missleading. How may people are going to fall into the same trap. The owner of the Apartment Gloria has not issued a refund despite our attempt to contact him immediately following his email and he did not answer our calls. It appears that Booking.com has no control over it and ultimately if somethig is wrong with your booking you can say goodbye to your money. I would never book another accommodation through them.        	                3	1	Sunday	booking	negative
1770	            Do not trust this site! Find your own accommodation and contact them directly. Instead of making your trip smoother and hassle free they will complicate things with their BS terms and conditions. I was kicked out of a hotel because I missed the check in times and they were 'fully booked'. It was 1am I was asked to leave and when I called Booking.com the told me to pay an additional 100 Euros at a nearby hostel for the night. One manager in particular (Cory) blamed me and said there was nothing he could do! Upon booking I specifically stated what time I would be arriving, neither the hotel nor Booking.com contacted me to tell me this would be too late. Instead I had to travel 1000s of miles to be told in person. The sorry excuse for a manager even told me that my reservation hadn't been looked at yet! This was 1week after it had been made!  But guess what? They took the money out of my account that very day! Booking.com has no compassion for customers and don't care about their safety and wellbeing. In the end I stayed in a filthy room with damp and mold all over the place. I had to pay more money to upgrade because my initial room was the size of a shoe box! I had to deal with racist, unhelpful staff members and Booking.com didn't even bother to contact me the next day to see if I was okay. HORRIBLE COMPANY. Your first booking might be okay but I guarantee they will mess up, and when they do you'll be truly f*cked.        	                1	1	Sunday	booking	negative
1771	"            My family and I alternate  visits   to this area  and the west coast about every 3 months  Finding  and staying at different hotels is part of the fun during our trips.We also alternate booking agencies.   This time we stayed at the ocean breeze in Daytona beach Florida may 24th through may 31st. We chose this hotel due to reviews /pics and price listed on booking.com .BIG mistake!! This hotel was filthy,had terrible customer service and we even had NO electricity on one day and NO water on another. We asked to speak to management twice  and of course NOT available. Staff had no clue power was out or why. Furniture even in the lobby had  gray and black buildup from filth. The water issue was explained as someone knocked a line loose on ice machine.. Really?! We have contacted booking.com 3x and each time we are put on hold and an attempt to speak with a hotel manager and to NO surprise he is never available  and I am never contacted by booking .com as promised except for one email. so I contact booking .com to follow up on the situation myself  and I am offered $80 compensation on a completely unacceptable $800 hotel stay&gt; and even asked WHY did you not get pictures of No electricity and No water by representative ""angellica"" &gt; WOW!! I had full confidence this would be handled appropriately after being assured with  first phone call that if hotel did not respond then there is only one side to complaint and in my eyes the fact hotel did not respond speaks volumes!! ultimately after several phone calls to booking.com on my own time since they did not return promised calls to me I ended w/  supervisor Katie (whom i had to request) and she apologized  for the bad stay as well as the mishandling of my complaint and gave us a compensation for the 2 days w/o electric or water $190. Am I satisfied ? No not really, that hotel is a $50 max per  day stay even if utilities had been in proper operation. Will we use booking.com again ? No! Plain and simple to  make us a satisfied customer We should have been refunded 50% of  our cost due  to  not only the multiple issues w/ the hotel itself but also due to the mishandling of our complaint..  I hope that for future customers Booking.com reassesses their advertisement of this hotel  as well as how their customer service handles complaints so future vacationers don,t have the unpleasantness that we did .

1772	"            Booking.com do not publish most of negative hotel reviews! I posted a negative review about a hotel, because they increased prices for my room on checkout (!!!) when I wanted to left a hotel, but the price was lower before. After a research I found out that the most of negative reviews are removed from Booking.com!!! You can also see this from other people reviews here. And they will not tell you that your review was removed. Their prices are also much higher comparing to direct booking. In the hotel where I'm living right now I paid 210 Euro for 6 days, but Booking.com suggested the same room for 300 Euro - much more expensive. They also show manipulative messages like ""hurry, only one room left"" etc. - typical NLP tricks used by bad companies. Overall, I'm very unhappy with them and I will never use Booking.com again. I also will stop using Kayak booking website, because it also belongs to them.        "	                2	1	Saturday	booking	negative
1773	"            I made two booking reservations at the same hotel called 'Hotel Terminal' in Milan near the central station for a weekend and the following weekend.The first weekend I stayed there was not the best experience, as it was pretty bad! It did not compare anything at all to what was on booking.com, therefore I gave them a bad review. Unfortunately, we could not change our reservation for the following weekend as it would have cost me quite a lot to do so, so I had to come back to the same hotel. Once I arrived at 3PM hotel, they requested full pay of my stay and they made me aware, in a hostile manner, that they had received my feedback for my previous stay. At 5PM that same day I receive an email from booking.com that my reservation was canceled, although I was already staying at the hotel and I had already paid in full. I called booking.com to understand why that had happened and they said that they received a cancellation update from the hotel. I told them that was not true and that I could provide them with a copy of my receipt to prove otherwise. They said that it will be fine and as soon as they get my receipt they will reinstate my booking on the website, which in turn will allow me to leave feedback on my second stay. A week later nothing happened, so I call booking.com back and ask them why my reservation is yet not showing on the system and they then informed me that there was nothing they can do about it.I was really upset that they had cheated me on the right to give my own feedback, as booking.com is always promoting ""real hotel, real guest"".

1792	            My first and last experience with booking.com, i booked a hotel in the IOM with booking.com in February 2017, the website was very unclear if the hotel would charge you when you place the booking or just when you arrive to stay at the hotel. The hotel charged my credit card for half the price of the booking within 3 days of placing the booking with booking.com. On 16th May i had to cancel my booking, the booking said the cancellation was free and if any monies had been debited from card they would be refunded to me. On the 19th may, i emailed booking.com to explain my cancellation and approx how long do refunds take. No reply, I emailed again to the hotel and booking.com no reply from either. I then rang booking.com 'customer service' on 24th May and was informed, as this was the busiest time of year it might take up to two days to reply, when i highlighted this time period had expired she just said she could see the email but I would need to send proof the hotel had debited my credit card by sending them my credit card details statement and if a refund was not issued by hotel they would give me a refund themselves. I asked how long this procedure would take and she said 5 days from that day. The lady i spoke to at booking.com, spoke to me like this was my fault and had no customer service skills. I therefore emailed the evidence they required to booking.com and hotel and asked if someone could reply to the email so I knew the query was being dealt with, again no reply. I rang up on 26th May and the gentleman i spoke to said he could see my email but it had not been dealt with as once again this was there busiest time of year and emails may take up to two working days to reply too. I therefore informed him i had sent booking.com a total of four emails from 19th may and not one had been replied to, he apologized and said this last email will be authorized today but i have to give the hotel 7 working days to carryout a refund of my monies! I said i was not happy with this and I wanted to speak to someone about this and make a complaint, he then put me on hold for 5 minutes when he spoke to his supervisor. He then advised me the supervisor would not speak to me as the was nothing that could be further discussed!?! I then asked if i could have telephone number or email address to log my complaint further with booking.com.........i was told i was speaking to the customer service team and this was only people that could deal with my complaint but the was nothing else that could be done! 14 days later since cancellation of my booking and i have still not received my refund of £112.50..................first and last time I will ever use this joke of a company.        	                3	1	Tuesday	booking	negative
1793	            I had booked a Homestay at Malvan India through Booking.com with CONFIRMATION NUMBER: 1632.278.570 but at the time of check-in the owner refused to give the key of room as it was already occupied.How Booking.com can provide such bogus information about any hotel and also confirmed one's booking even the room was not vacant really disappointed with this website. Also the customer care number was not reachable from that location so one can neither reach to the website customer support nor the room owner.        	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	positive

1795	            Booked 3 rooms for isle of man.  Had set up their app as booking.com advised to track bookings.  Two of the rooms were ordered under googlemail.com and the other under gmail.com both feed into the same email address box. So when i went to check nearer the trip the gmail booking wasnt showing on the app and i thought it hadnt gone through.  As the hotel was full i cancelled the 2 rooms showing and booked 3 rooms through booking.com at a different hotel on same dates.  So because there was no confirmation of booking and not shown on booking.com app i have been charged £110 for a no show.  Despite 3 phone calls to Booking.com with call ended by them on one call and 2 calls with promises to ring me back they havent and actually implied i was a liar and that they couldnt see the details on my app so couldnt comment.  Correct neither could i.  I was even told they didnt book the hotel rooms i did so they are not responsible!!!  They just collect commission.  I implore you do not use this company.  They are not to be trusted and do not listen to you.  Even the hotel we stayed at said they make so many mistakes.  Book with Booking.com at your peril.  They have certainly lost me as a customer.        	                3	1	Sunday	booking	negative

1797	            Made a reservation nearly a week ago on booking.com. When I tried to check in today, the front-desk staff told me that there's no related reservation for me and all rooms are booked. He asked me to call booking. I did so. I kept calling booking for nearly 15 minutes and finally a guy answered my call. And, he hanged up after checking my confirmation No.# and PIN. I thought it might be bad connection so I kept calling again and again. After about another 10 minutes later, the front-desk staff asked me, did Booking.com told you anything? I said, no, they hanged up after checking my reservation information. The pal said they(booking.com) just call the front desk asking me to tell you stop calling them! I ask why they don't call you and try to solve the problem. They hanged up, too!Then I knew why nobody answered my phone, because they didn't dare to tell me they messed my reservation! And then I realized that I'd better find another hotel available immediately. Otherwise, I'll be sleep in the street!Want to make a reservation? Keep AWAY from Booking. Using booking.com at your own RISK. With booking.com, you'll be NOT booked.        	                1	1	Saturday	booking	negative
1798	            I have to admit that I have booked a few times with booking.com in the past and not had any problems. However this last experience has meant that a weekend away has been cancelled through no fault of my own and customer service was unable to help.I received an email saying that they were unable to process my credit card and to update it, which I promptly did. I still received another email exactly the same the next morning. I called them up and they said for me to update it again, so I used a different card. No resolution. I then called for a second time and customer service told me to call the bank since it was nothing at their end and so it is the bank that is blocking it. I thought this unlikely since I had used different cards from different banks but duly did this. The bank said there was no problem their end. So I emailed booking.com asking for help since I didn't fancy being on hold again. I received a standard response about how to update my card details! And now I have just received an email saying that my booking is cancelled. I am at my wit's end and would not recommend booking through booking.com to anyone.        	                1	1	Friday	booking	negative
1799	            In the USA, Booking.com customer service is terrible/horrible, unable to reach customer service, no direct customer service phone number on the cover page and time consuming to find phne number, unreasonable cancellation policy, wrong confirmation dates, slow response.  Booking.com represantivives have not ability or skills to solve issues promptly, are almost incompetent.  However, if you book accommodations to go to Japan, try Japnese Booking.com (Ph; 0367436650). Booking.com is the same company but they are much more efficient, competent, willing to negotiate with hotels/ryokans. I could not solve the issues by talking to US repesantitive but it did smoothly with Japanese assistants. They were all helpful and prompt. However, I will not book through Booking.com anymore. I had two booking dates came up wrong on confirmation than I had actually requested and had a trouble cancelling or modifying due to wrong date despite I immediately contacted about wrong dates within 30 min. It took almost few days-5 days to resolve the issue by contacting directly with hotels because US booking.com reps are so unhelpful.        	                1	1	Friday	booking	negative
1800	            we booked an apartment through Booking.com. When you book you enter a legally binding contract with the supplier of the accommodation, in this case seemingly a private individual.If I attempted to cancel the booking there would be a £250.00 fee to pay. However, if the supplier cancels it would appear they can do this without penalty.That's exactly what happened and I am now taking legal action to impose identical fees payable from the supplier to the disappointed customer. Booking.com advertise themselves as the intermediary between the customer and supplier. They seem to support the supplier rather than customer suggesting that we just find somewhere else.Misses the point doesn't it??Booking.com have been reluctant to provide contact address and detail of owner of accommodation to allow the legal process to continue.        	                6	1	Friday	booking	negative

I was there twenty minutes from check in to check out and brought the issue up to the woman in the front (who smelled like a bottle of liquor). I emailed booking.com IMMEDIATELY after the check out and even used BOOKING.COM to book the room I ended up staying in after leaving.  After two weeks they email me back saying they can't do anything because I didn't bring it up at the counter in the hotel.  I sent BOOKING.COM the receipt in which I even wrote my complaints after being given the receipt.  They don't care about the customer apparently and only listen to the hotel.  Doesn't matter if you leave right away - they send you to a 0 star hotel and claim it's a 3 star hotel.  Horrible service.  Did a charge bank with my bank - and I'll be posting this review EVERYWHERE for their lack of service.        	                1	1	Friday	booking	negative

Booking those not understand (or want people to believe) that I made arrangements with them and not that hotel, and won't help you solve a problem they created by lying when they show you and offer and state the conditions of the reservation.Way to go booking.com! you definitely lost a customer, and hopefully this sad experience prevents others from being tricked by booking.com        "	                1	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

If these fees are known why the lack of transparency ? Instead they show a deceptive non-inclusive figure which looks more competitive than the likes of Trivago and Expedia.

After waiting on the phone for almost 10 minutes on hold Customer service was unhelpful and totally not equipped to deal with our complaint. We were left to figure it out ourselves and worst of all: I asked Customer Service to call me back and they never did. They did not checkup on us (paying customers) and it seems like did not care at all.They are just there to take your money and Customer Service is totally not their priority.With so many choices to book your accommodations I can say that I will never use Booking.com again.        	                4	1	Sunday	booking	negative

Contacting booking.com was no help whatsoever all they did was say sorry we can't do anything! Then I booked a night in Amsterdam, I checked when I can cancel the booking by as per there website as my plans where not finalised. I tried on the cancellation date as per the website to cancel was not able as it said I had to cancel only a few after booking.

1821	            Booking is an easy site to use, with well organized information and lots of good photos of the properties.  Hotels pay booking for their listings, and I'm not sure booking gets highly preferred rates, nor if booking customers get preferred rooms.  Today, looking at their site, they no longer list HOW MANY customers have reviewed a specific hotel.  Instead they give a rating without the number of people who reviewed a place.  These ratings are ONLY valid given the number of respondents.  for example, If there are only 3 people replying and they give an 8.9 to a hotel, the rating is virtually meaningless.  As opposed to 350 respondents averaging 8.9 which means a great deal.   IF they no longer list NUMBER OF RESPONDENTS, don't bother noting the overall rating a hotel is given.  It has no weight without the number of people reviewing.        	                1	3	Tuesday	booking	positive

1828	"            Recently my wife and I had a short break near Paris. Due to return to England on the Friday, we decided we didn't want the hassle of driving up to the Midlands so we booked a hotel at Pevensey Bay through Booking.com. We filled in their form and because I'm disabled (COPD lost 75% lung function) we also filled in their information box to let them know of my disabilities and very limited mobility. Friday came and we presented ourselves at the hotel. The hotelier could clearly see my condition and showed me a very steep flight of steps going up to our intended room. She explained that this was the first flight and there were a lot more (nearly 40 in all) to the room a the top of the hotel. Impossible for me, it would have killed me.I told the hotelier that I had written on Booking.com's form of my disabilities and the hotelier stated that Booking.com neglected to inform her of this. She then stated that this had happened many times before to this and other hotels in the area. In fact another cancellation was made that same day for the same reason. The hotelier was very kind and even though it was no fault of hers she managed to find us another hotel (a bit of a drive away and twice the price). When I returned home I wrote an email to Booking.com complaining about their appalling service and I asked why this information had not been passed on.I received a reply from Booking.com. Here is a transcript of it: ""Thank you for choosing Booking.com. We are writing to you regarding your reservation. We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience. We've checked on our system to find your request. Unfortunately, there were no request from you on our system. We're sure that if we received the request, we would pass on the request to the property. Please feel free to contact us with any additional questions."" I replied to this: ""Why am I not surprised that this would be your response. It would be expected after your appalling service to call the customer a liar to cover your own backs. I can assure you this request was sent in front of 3 witnesses so please do not adopt this attitude with me or you will be facing litigation."" We received no recompense from these people. My advice would be to stay well clear of this company. Their customer care or people skills are zero.        "	                2	1	Thursday	booking	neutral

1831	            I booked an apartment in Los Cristianos in Tenerife. The website clearly stated that it would cost £687.00. I was charged £708.72. While this is only £21.72 over, if they do this to all their clients they are making plenty of money by overcharging. I complained to booking.com by e-mail twice, leaving a week between each e-mail. I received no reply. I telephoned, and the person who answered claimed that the price was in Euros. In fact it clearly stated the price in pounds on the website when I booked, with the euro price (€809.80) in small numbers next to it. In any case, if the price in pounds was converted from euros there is no reason why that conversion should be any different when charged to my card immediately afterwards. Beware! There are plenty of other holiday booking sites.        	                16	1	Thursday	booking	neutral

I called booking.com and spoke to the nicest lady, who took care of me in this fragile moment. She contacted the hotel, and found out that they had alredy refunded the money, and I would have it in my account in a couple of days. Very good news.

I NEVER EVER trust the pictures at booking.com anymore. Because they are - as I have often experienced - totally wrong. The booking.com-hotline tells you then: SORRY we count on the honesty of the hotel as our partner.... (-; - so no fault at booking.com...I booked an apartment in Italy. Pictures where showing balcony, Lakeview etc. in reality was the apartment in the basement without any chance of sun and NO Lakeview at all. Cancellation fee: EUR 90!!!I checked a lot of reviews about booking.com. For myself I'm sure, that they write most of this reviews themselves. There is no other explanation, because in the meantime I met a lot of people that made the same experiences like me.        	                2	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

At this stage we discovered that Booking.com customer services is shambles. We spoke to various polite guys who were quite unable to actually do anything to help, the best that they would do is offer us an unsuitable apartment that we would have to book directly with a non-Booking.com owner! I had to urgently search for alternative accommodation and pay for it in full at a higher price as it was now a late booking. I then had to chase up and wait a week to receive a refund which was now short due to the owner forcing me to pay for the paypal fees! I had to waste hours and am out of pocket by about £150 not to mention the stress. No compensation or real assistance was offered by Booking.com. I feel they should have ensured I did not have any financial loss, either dierectly or compensation from the cancelled property owner.        	                4	3	Tuesday	booking	neutral

They start by telling you that you have to hurry because everything is selling out really quickly and this is the last accommodation available. Page 1: I click the ""I'll reserve"" button with the text ""Don't worry you wont be charged yet!"" below it.Page 2: ""Enter Detail to Hold Your Booking"" - here I enter my credit card details. It says ""You don't need to enter a CVC code"", which makes me think that they cannot charge on my card and that it is only needed for reserving the apartment.

The British Pound is only 10 times as expensive as the Danish currency.I am never booking through this scam company again.

1849	"            Written on: 24/04/2017 by andrewnalma (1 review written)I booked two hotel rooms for my Sons College Graduation and according to Booking.com there where 5 rooms available. I paid at the time of booking. One weeks later I get a call from the hotel stating that Booking.com had overbooked by 50 rooms and they were contacting everyone to let them know and that they had already contacted booking.com regarding this mistake. I contacted booking.com for a refund and they gave me the run around and said they would have to verify with the hotel, and that it was the hotels responsibility to rebook me (WHAT??) I called the hotel again and they said they were in contact with booking.com and they had all the information and call them back. I called them back and still got the run around and after much complaining they said they would send me an e-mail and I had to reply with a copy of my bank statement showing the charge which I did and another week goes by still no refund. I call booking.com again and they act like it's the first time I've called and they have no information and that they will have to contact the hotel to confirm (WHAT IS GOING ON) they put me on hold and verified again with the hotel that they were overbooked and then said ""we will send you an e-mail please reply with a copy of your bank statement showing the charge"" OH MY GOD I'M ABOUT TO LOSE MY MIND and the booking.com rep also said that it's up to the hotel to refund my money. FOR GOD SAKE DO NOT USE BOOKING.COM and remember that if you use PRICELINE you are using BOOKING.COM. I recommend that everyone use Hotels.com their customer service is excellent.

Do you mean that booking is able to accept a booking for a hotel that is closed?? Their answer is yes!! This is the end of my trust in this company.

1854	            Used them for years but you only get to see a company in their true light when something goes wrong. I booked pay on arrival for 3 rooms also stated pay in euros on arrival on my booking app. I then 2 months later get charged £600 straight from my bank account. Contacted them on my 7th email sent them everything they asked but constant requests for more proof. I had to write it off as they just didn't care. What happened to calling you and ensuring they resolved it. No just constant emails requesting info and uploads of personal details. They knew the hotel / date / and had my bank account withdrawals but still did nothing. Do not use them or travel republic as you will end up out of pocket if it goes wrong. Another disgraceful company happy to make profit from you. As you can see from the response below, I was 3 weeks into this complaint and adhered to all requests. When you send document after document its obvious you are being kept dangling on a string. I booked the holiday via the app and my bank details were contained within. If you cannot view my booking and details then that concerns me even more. How about your company doing something like call the hotel and ask them why they charged me at the hotel and took the money from my account.

1882	            I booked a hotel to stay over a night with a friend at Clardon Park Place Hotel in Leicestershire, however a week before travel i had some bad news. I was told my grandmother who i lived with all my life only had 7 days to live. I told booking.com immediately the situation and they said they will deal with it and get back to me. A day or two later someone rang me from the accounts department stating that they will refund was processed. So i did not bother chasing it up. 2 weeks later i still did not receive a refund and i asked booking.com what happened. They stated an email was sent over saying the hotel rejected to refund the funds even under the circumstance. The only thing they could say was 'did you check your junk emails'. Of course under the circumstance, i was very stressed and not myself however i would not feel the need to check this if someone called me taking my bank details over the phone and offered a refund. During the time and checked my junk and it appears nothing was received. You would think in situations like that, they would attempt to call you and let you know the news first but they did not.They left me to deal with the hotel and did not try attempt to get involved after this point. After speaking to the hotel, the confirmed its another third party that deals with funds.It took them over a week to get a correspondent over to their third party and eventually a 20% refund was accepted which i better than nothing. However i still till this day have not received no funds. I would not book with them again, i do not recommend booking with them. Their customer service department are useless.

1883	"            Used booking.com to arrange for a multi-night stay at a coastal hotel using the ""pay upon arrival"" option. The hotel ran my debit card anyway resulting in me having $125.00 in overdraft fees. The hotel only reversed the charges in the amount of the stay. I've contacted the hotel who say the overdraft fees aren't their issue. I've also contacted booking.com about this and have yet to receive even a ""We're sorry!"" I'm livid and have had to cancel my stay on the coast because I'm on the hook for the the $125.00 that I didn't have to begin with. To say the least ... I'm not happy!

1884	            We booked a hotel in August 2016 for a trip to Prague this coming April 2017. Two weeks ago we got a mail that the booking is cancelled because of renovation. Well, thanks a lot. Thats a little late now to tell us. Could you maybe provide us with another hotel then? It's now impossible for us to find anything in that price range. You just left us in Prague with no place to sleep. A booking we did 7 months ago. Bad product! Bad service! I would never recommend someone doing this business and then just take it for granted that people can solve the problem themselves. A problem you created. We can argue that it aint your fault the hotel cancelled. But you provided us with the info that we had a place to sleep for 7 months. You could at least have provide us some alternatives and not just leave it with the cancelled note! We (your customers) demand that from you, so you should demand that from the hotels to. A safety for the customer that when they make a booking they for sure have a place to stay for the money they spend. Specially for people who make bookings so long time before the stay.        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	neutral

1897	            I have used booking.com a lot (around 100 hotels) and the website itself is very good and offers good prices. Altogether I'm satisfied with it. The only issues I've had is when the hotels themselves do things and ask for additional payments which they shouldn't. I've had this problem when I traveled with my dog and a hotel asked a huge fee for it although on booking.com it stated that it should be free and another time when the hotel asked for an upfront payment, although I already paid through booking.com. Booking either didn't responf to emails concerning this or was very slow to solve this after telephone calls.  So they should try to harder to resolve issues promplty when they do appear (and this is of course inevitable).        	                4	4	Wednesday	booking	positive

1905	            I am a host on Booking.com and for the most part find their service to me to be excellent.  As a host I am here to provide accommodations and service and in return earn an income.  It is the property that collects money from the guest, not Booking.com, they simply provide the means of booking.  So if you can't get your money back then it is your review of the property that counts.  People read property reviews, before booking. Double bookings ---  This is my biggest problem.  About 95% of the people in the country where I live, do not show up for reservations, nor do they cancel, and they lie saying they will be there in 2 hours then don't come.   Hence, I don't hold rooms for people more than 2 hours after check-in, unless I have a deposit.  I know my policy causes those of you who are considerate problems, unfortunately the number of inconsiderate people have forced my hand in order that I can achieve the objective of earning a reasonable income. Customer Service -- Booking.com at least has a phone number to call.  Much better than another site I host on.  And yes, I have my frustrations, but for the most part they try pretty hard.        	                1	5	Saturday	booking	positive

1907	            I have had the worst experience ever with this company, I booked a room to possibly go and see a friend quite far from myself, was not sure if I was going to be able to attend so I made sure when booking a room I selected one with free cancellations as to not lose money if I couldn't make it, after cancelling the room I have been informed that property does not offer free cancellation and I have been charged the full amount, After informing booking.com that the room I selected was not the room I was given and there had been an error on there part meaning the room on show that I booked was never actually offered by the hotel and it had always been full fee charged if cancelled they are not willing to refund my money. For such a large company to not have the technical ability to resolve this by investigating what could have gone wrong with this booking causing the room I selected and specifically needed to apparently have never been on offer is outrageous  I feel. I will never be using booking.com again or the property in question but due to trustpilots terms of service I cannot mention there name in this review.Avoid this company at all costs you will have problems and won't get any help in resolving them just more head aches        	                1	1	Friday	booking	negative

Until last week, when I encountered a problem...I had booked an entire house on Big Corn Island by the name of Brokis Place. Since there was one negative review, in which someone had written that his reservation had not been respected, I decided to give them a call a few days before departure to double check if my reservation was indeed confirmed.I ended up speaking to a rude man who told me that the house wasn't available on those dates and that was it. No discussion possible about my confirmed booking.I then wrote to booking.com to complain about these people and their apparent scam.ONE week after my complaint, I received an e-mail from booking customer service to tell me that indeed the house was not available, but good news for me: they had found me a great alternative and if I would book their alternative the price of my booking would remain he same. Upon checking their suggested alternative, it turned out to be a double/twin room without even a private bathroom and the price would be 90 Dollars less! I sent them another e-mail asking a whole bunch of questions, but they just ignored all of them, cancelled my booking at Brokis Place and that seemed to be the end of it.Here's their reply:""We apologize that our alternative did not meet your requirements.Your original reservation will be cancelled at no charge to you, and you will receive an email confirming the cancellation shortly.On behalf of the accommodation, we apologise for the inconvenience caused.If we can be of any further assistance to you, please feel free to contact us.Thank you again for choosing Booking.com.

When I spoke to booking.com &amp; told them that I had only been refunded half the woman on the phone 'julinter' told me I had been refunded the full amount, she was very patronising which made me just want to speak to a manager she refused &amp; told me she was going to put the phone down on me. And did! So I called back (almost in tears) asking to talk to a manager about what had just happened on the previous call.. She refused also &amp; put the phone down!

1915	            This is my first and last time using this site. They lure you in with a price, which is misleading. You only discover the price is wrong when you actually make the booking. Once you are in the process of making the  booking all sorts of glitches appear which makes it difficult to access the advertise price - which is the basis of your transaction. Once the transaction has been completed the price is much higher than that quoted and to come out at this stage  you need to pay a cancellation fee.They also make a  payment calculation  in dollars not local currency which is much cheaper.

No receipt was given and we were not allowed to visit the rooms prior to payment. Access to the rooms was by a long steep outdoors staircase, no lift. It was as we went up the stairs I noticed the sign saying it was a one star hostel, the room allocated was a complete disgrace, the walls were the same thickness as the width of the doors and so many things wrong there is not enough room here to list them all. Nothing was as the advert described. After 2 minutes, with my wife in tears, I went down to ' reception' , a cafe, and asked for our money back, this was refused. I immediately telephoned Booking.com who asked me to send photographs but offered no alternative accommodation, or would not speak to the hotel. When I asked for the key to take photographs this was refused. I took photos of the hostal sign and sent them to Booking.com. I never received an apology, but was offered a 10% refund which I refused as I felt a full refund was in order. Booking.com have not replied to any of my correspondence, but did change the status of the ' Hotel ' to Hostal.

Unfortunatelly it seems that company grow to the point that can't handle anymore with all customers and don't care about them. Recently I booked a hotel in Mexico and was partly charged straight away after even during booking process nothing was mentioned about that. I got this information together with booking confirmation. It wasn't a big problem for me till moment when I decided to change my plans and cancel this booking. First of all I contacted Booking.com after couple of days asking when refund wil be make. I was ensured that it would be very shortly and I will be informed about that. After couple of days of silence I've contacted them again and surprisingly was asked for proof of this charge!!! Of course I provided my statment and again was ensured that refund will be proceed shorly. After other couple of days I was informed that refund has been done already and I need to wait. 1.5 week later without any updates I called again and found out that hotel couldn't proceed refund because my bank blocked it!!! JOKE!!! at the same time I was informed that case was escalated to Finance department and someone will contact me shortly to proceed refund this time by BOOKING.COM itself..Well again silence, no email replies ets. Today I called them again and was informed that refund will take AT LEAST 2 ANOTHER WEEKS!!!! Well ...I just want to say that it's very sad and dissapointing when trusted and good company changing so badly.

1929	            I've booked hotels with booking.com lots of times, I've been able to reserve rooms and cancel them within the feee cancellation time.  I was looking for hotels in Rome for my mother in law who is disabled - I reserved a few different ones, as I've also done. My bank rang us to say that all our money had been take out of our account and left us with nothing.  I was baffled by this as this has never happened before. Booking.com say that's its a preauthorisation from the hotel and no money is charged to that card. I beg to differ booking.com cause you've left us with no money to live.   Don't believe what they tell you. They are saying it's going to take 5 working days for the money to go back in!!!! My husband is going away before then and has no money to go with!! It shouldn't have been taken in the first place. Will use Expedia from now on. MISLEADING UNTRUSTWORTHY service from booking.com will not use this service ever again.        	                2	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

1932	            If you have a complaint with a hotelier (as we recently have) booking.com will always defend the hotel, because they are the ones who pay booking.com commission! I sent booking.com photos of the awful place and put forward a constructive case as to why I was complaining. ooking.com were of no help at all. If you raise a dispute with booking.com they will not send you a link to review the hotel. Thereby ensuring - almost exclusively - hotels only get positive reviews. Shameful!!!        	                5	1	Sunday	booking	negative
1933	            I contacting Booking.com and replied to their initial response fobbing me off with a boiler plate response that ignored the content of my query entirely, as the Hotel Furka on their website states free private parking in the search results, but then free public parking only when you click through to book, and a charge of €10 for private parking. False advertising like this is a real con and wastes time when searching for a hotel. When I finally got a response addressing my query as to why the results page states something different to the actual hotel details page, Booking.com merely reiterated what is on the details page and ignored the false advertising on the results page that I had pointed out. Talk about not giving a s**t about trying to con your customers through false advertising as the private parking cost is at the bottom of the page on the details section so buried away a fair bit.        	                25	1	Saturday	booking	positive
1934	            Made a booking for an apartment in Rome and was told by Booking.com that the amount included all local taxes and fees apart from a cleaning fee, which was fine by us.  Whilst in Rome, I was told by the apartment owner that we had to pay her a €73.50 local tourist tax as that was not included.  Booking.com also sent me an email to inform us of the same whilst we were on holiday and blamed the property owner for the original lack of information, but Booking.com had acted as an agent for the owner before so must know there should be a tourist tax for Rome.  We had to pay the owner but I wasn't happy with Booking.com as we felt it was their mistake and it nearly caused some unpleasantness for our holiday as well as giving us an unexpected expense.  Also, when I booked the holiday giving my credit card details, I assumed it was paid for then to Booking.com.   However, I only found out whilst in Rome that I actually had to pay for the property rental then directly to the owner, but I don't think that was clear at all when booking the holiday.  I was later asked to review their customer service procedure which had been used and I said it was poor and gave reasons why but they have not replied to that so I'm going to have to complain again!        	                6	2	Friday	booking	positive

1936	            Made a booking and got confirmation from booking.com and The Hotel Sanctuary in New York. The hotel then decided that the rate was incorrect 2 days later and asked us to cancel or pay over another $1000 on top of the price and this after they took a deposit of over $300 to confirm the booking so also charged over £8 for the exchange rate fee on top. Hotel blaming booking.com booking.com blaming the Hotel. At the end of the day they should honour there mistake like the majority of companies do. Booking.Com not bothered to rectify this and let the hotel get away with it and also asking us to contact the hotel directly to sort...

One day, I was really eager to book a room for my friend who lives in The UK (I'm from Denmark), and I'm not able to call to any UK numbers and this was in the middle of the night and she had to get a room for the next day. So I called to Booking.com and I got to talk to a guy named Lawrence and thank Jesus for that man!!We spoke together for like an hour, and he helped me with everything. I found a hotel at first, and then he would call directly to the hotel asking if it was possible to do a ""Third-Party-creditor"" meaning that I won't be there, but I pay for the room in advance and they have my fully valid confirmation on that. (Usually, I would have to wait for a few hours for answers from hotels through the chat, but this was so much easier and faster).Everything turned out to be amazing, so thank you so much for your help!

1953	            My husband and I had booked a hotel through booking.com that we had long been wanting to stay at. We had initially booked two nights, but then considered changing to one night. We were unable to change our booking through booking.com, so we contacted the hotel about the possibility of changing but it turned out it was about the same price for one or two nights so we decided to keep our reservation… BUT then we received a message from booking.com that our booking had been cancelled. I contacted them to ask why and to say that it must be a mistake. They claimed that they had been contacted by the hotel to cancel, but the hotel declined this. Instead of rebooking the hotel immediately they took several days and in the meantime the hotel got fully booked. Not only does this mean that we can no longer stay at the hotel we wanted to, but there is in fact no longer hotels available in that town - booking.com has offered two alternatives but firstly they are double price and secondly they are about 20 kilometers away so useless.

1961	            Someone had fraudulently used my card details to pay for a hotel on Booking.com at the cost of £750. I immediately rang booking.com to try and get more information but was met with a brick wall. Showed no compassion or empathy that I literally just had my life ruined, and all the money I had robbed form me. Refused to even transfer me to a supervisor or another department which could help me, stating the only thing I could do was email them as there was no number for them to use to call the accounts department. This is completely unacceptable, your internal communication issues are not my problem, they are your problem.I repeatedly explained I could not afford to email as it may take days to get a response, as it was a matter of urgency that required escalating. They repeatedly refused to do anything, stating over and over again I needed to email them. Someone somewhere in this world is enjoying a nice holiday at my expense, they used my details to make a payment to Booking.com. I find it impossible to believe booking.com had no way of looking up the booking details when I could provide them with my account details and details of the transaction. That level of incompetence is completely unacceptable and frankly embarrassing. Obviously I was upset, but remained completely polite but assertive throughout the call, understanding it may have been a unusual phone call to customer services (I hope) and the customer advisor speaking to me was no way responsible. The advisor said she couldn't afford to spend to morning talking to me about it, I repeatedly said I could not afford to end this call. So she hung up on me! Can you actually believe it, someone was a victim of a crime, having hundreds of pounds stolen from them in which you organisation was a third party, and your customer service advisors 'don't have time' to talk to me? And her supervisor did not even have the courtesy to talk to me? I am actually lost for words. When I spoke to Visa regarding the transaction they told me it was an 'unsecured' transaction. I am not sure who the responsibility lies with to make sure the online transactions are secured (Booking.com or the bank?). But I definitely feel booking.com should accept some accountability of allowing a criminal to do this on their website. Unhelpful would be an understatement.        	                6	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

1966	"            Do NOT use booking.com unless you're 100% sure, you're not going to cancel your booking later !Saturday 7th of January I booked a room at Hotel Wittelsbach am Kurfürstendam in Berlin for 13 nights in December. Sunday 8th of January I had to cancel the booking. At that time the full payment had already been ""reserved"" from my account. (That way the money is still in my account; I just can't use it.) This is something some hotels do while they pre-check my credit card. Irritating, but I've tried it before and normally there's no problem.Since I'd cancelled the booking Sunday I thought, the money would be ""free"" at least Tuesday.Boy was I wrong ! I called booking.com Tuesday where it wasn't possible to speak to a Danish speaking person - which I prefer since I'm Danish calling a Danish number - but I got to speak to a woman from Asia speaking English with a clear Asian accent. She didn't seem to be interested in listening to me, All she kept saying was, that the hotel had ""reserved"" my money while they were pre-checking my credit card. I tried explaining to her that the booking was cancelled but she just kept talking about the pre-checking. Unfortunately my temper got the better of me and I ended up speaking quite loud and then hanging up.Wednesday, Thursday and Friday I sent mails - in Danish - via the homepage without receiving any answer until today.However the answer I got wasn't to my question (why do the hotel ""reserve"" money for a cancelled booking) but was an explanation about the pre-checking procedure.Today 5 working days after I cancelled the booking, the money (1307 Euro) is still reserved !!I haven't contacted the hotel, as I'm a customer of booking.com and not Hotel Wittelsbach and I'm assuming that since my booking goes through, so must also my cancellation !

1970	            I have recently had a bad experience with booking.com and after investigating the situation I found a flaw in the system that I would like to expose here, hopefully to change booking.com’s policies, but if not, to warn fellow travellers. Unless the website’s policies aren’t changed, I am not going to use booking.com again, as I found it to be unsafe for the customer.The situation was the following: I booked a bed in a hostel in France and gave my credit card details to booking.com “to secure my booking”. I am pretty sure that this is the reason why most people enter their credit card data – to be sure that when they arrive at the place, their bed or room will be available for them. However, when I arrived at the hostel, I found that my booking had been cancelled by the manager. He had had interest from other people passing by, so he gave my bed to someone else. I was also late (due to a delay of my flight which I had not been informed of by the airline), so he was able to do so within the hostel’s policies, which require you to confirm your booking. He did try to contact me, but given that I was on an international flight, of course I could not be reached by either e-mail or phone and could not let the hostel know that I was going to be delayed. I was not worried, as I thought my booking was secured through booking.com. Also, I knew that if I didn’t turn up, I would be charged the full price, which I think is fair enough – I totally understand that there is a business risk for the hostel due to people booking a room and then not showing up and this is another reason why I was willing to provide my credit card data in the first place. However, in booking.com’s small print is says that your booking is only secured as long as you stick to the hostel’s policies, which they are free to define as they like. This was also confirmed to me later by booking.com’s customer service via phone (that giving your credit card details does not secure your booking). As most people, I don’t usually read the small print and assume that it follows common sense mostly. You can blame me for this if you want to.This specific hostel had made a very restrictive policy which specifies that you have to confirm your booking again before your arrival and that you must arrive up to three hours until after your pre-specified arrival time – otherwise they are free to cancel your booking. I did violate these policies by not reconfirming my booking and by arriving very late. I do not deny this, so everything that booking.com and the hostel did, was within their policies, it was lawful. However, for anyone who has ever done an international trip involving flights and stays at cheap hostels, you also know that you don’t always have access to internet, much less so to phone calls to another country, and that you can have unexpected long delays when flying. The place where I stayed the day before my planned arrival at said hostel did not have functioning Wi-Fi, so I did not see the e-mail telling me to reconfirm my booking (ironically, neither did the hostel in question where I had had my booking cancelled as I read in several other travellers’ reviews). Then I was also on a plane and was unable to answer phone calls from France (not to mention the charges that you incur for calling from your cell phone when travelling outside the EU, as I was at the time). Being unable to communicate or to use the internet, I was happy to have secured a bed in the hostel with anticipation as I couldn’t have searched for a place in France at short notice. After a terrible delay of my flight (which was due to a snow storm), and a tiring trip from the airport to the hostel at night, I got the bad news that my booking had been cancelled. I was quite devastated as I had wanted nothing more than to sleep in a bed. However, the manager explained that I was very late, but that he could let me stay in the common area (which was a noisy bar in fact). He also said he wasn’t going to charge me (although this is not important for the point that I am making in this review). Since there was nothing I could do, I accepted and avoided any confrontation – mistakes like this happen and it seemed reasonable enough what he said, although I am sure some other people would have started a fight at this point.If you are still following my account, well done, as I am now making my point, and demonstrating the flaw in booking.com’s system: I was charged for this as I found out a few days later looking at my bank statement. My booking had not been secured, I arrived at the hostel, someone else was sleeping in the bed that was reserved for me, and I had to pay for this, and the person sleeping in it had to pay also. A ruthless hostel manager thus has the option to double his income by cancelling your booking because of a violation of the hostel’s booking policies, then giving your room/bed to someone else charging them as well, and also charging you, as you violated the hostel’s policies.This specific hostel already had a very low satisfaction rating, so a potential negative review by the upset traveller (in this case me) would not deter them from following this strategy. But as a traveller, I expect that if I book a bed, it is held for me, even if I arrive late – if the reception area had been closed and due to this I would have been unable to sleep at the hostel, OK, it would have been fair enough. But this was a deliberate attempt to double the hostel’s income at my expense, cancelling my booking and making me pay, whilst also making a second person pay who actually stayed there. If I don’t show up, you can charge me – if I do show up, you need to give me a bed, or not charge me. It is really not that difficult. The situation I experienced should not happen to anyone ever again. If someone shows up, however late it may be, the hostel has to have a responsibility to provide a bed and fulfil the booking made or if not, the guest should not be charged. Otherwise the system can be abused in the way it has happened to me.I do hope that booking.com’s customer service reads this review and updates their system accordingly. As for me, I am not going to use the website again if I cannot be sure about it having changed, and I would strongly urge anyone considering using it, to avoid it.        	                11	1	Wednesday	booking	positive
1971	            Good, but be aware that the hotels etc are independent operators who can tell any stories the like. For instance one hotel had fotos of neat toilets but they were not from the room. The fotos were from the toilets at the corridor.Some hotels ask for the security code of the credit card and they charge the account at once even if it is promised not to. It took a long time to get the money back after I cancelled the reservation. It was also a problem because of the credit limit.I mainly have good experiences.        	                2	4	Wednesday	booking	positive

1975	            Booking.com claim on their website that if you can find the identical deal to theirs cheaper on another website, then they will match the price. I'm moving home to Australia and booked an apartment with booking.com for 2 weeks at a cost of Australian dollars AUD$ 2,603. My credit card was billed for £1,541. The following day I saw the identical apartment for the same dates on expedia.co.uk. for £1,465. As £1,465 is cheaper than £1,541 I claimed the difference of AUD$128. They refused to pay because the two deals were offered in different currencies and referred to  their Terms &amp; Conditions. I read all the T&amp;C and nowhere does it say that the currency has to be the same, it only refers to being cheaper. How can they ignore their own T&amp;C and make it up as they go along? They offered me AUD$ 20 goodwill which I refused.  Just honour the guarantee and your own T&amp;C !!        	                2	1	Tuesday	booking	neutral
1976	            I have booked a room for Christmas a day before the arrival.Unfortunately 5min or so I had to cancel it. The policy says I cannot do it without a fee. Of course, I did not want to pay that as I was not going to travel anyway due to personal reasons (plans changed in a minute after booking the room). So I contacted the property landlord and customer support of the website. It was not easy to come into agreement, however customer support representative had helped me to to that without penalty fee. Yes, it was as an exception, but they took my side and did everything very professionally. Many thanks to customer support of booking.com!        	                1	5	Tuesday	booking	positive
1977	            Firstly i ve booked a hotel Fleur De Lys for 23 Euro. When i arrived in hotel they tried to charge me with almost 90 Euros. I pointed them the voucher but they didnt care. Hotel manager tried to convince me that its was only the money for lunch. But on voucher it was written that i ve booked a standard room. On the first contact with customer service everything looked fine. A Greek lady show the voucher and told me i was right. On the second phone call communication i had with your phone center after contact with hotel manager things turned upside down. Booking.com told me a mistake happened but even when after my repeating question whos fault is this. I didnt get any answer. On the third phone call i get from Booking.com the customer service admitted that there was a mistake from Booking.com mistake but due to low price i ve booked, i had to accept hotels price or cancel it for free. Even if i wanted to stay on this hotel i wouldnt due to hotel managers treatment. So i would like to thank you Booking.com for only admitting your mistake in words and not in deeds. I ve booked a price , as you say the price is guaranteed, but the price was wrong and i had to pay the difference without even know anything. So thank you Booking.com for almost ruining my stay to Dakar trying to find hotel in the middle of the day while i had meeting in the middle.        	                2	2	Monday	booking	negative

Upon complaint, customer service manager claims that I wasn't a loyal enough of a customer because could not find my previous bookings. When I searched my inbox and provided him with reservation numbers, he did not know what to say and hung up. I was charged $2000 for absolutely nothing, because I canceled only 3 days after their made up ""deadline"". Booking.com refuses to refund me and will not answer customer support emails.

1979	            We booked a hotel through Booking.com for our family vacation in Dubai during Christmas. The offer on their website clearly stated 25% discount and then what we thought was the total price for 5 days. It was pricy but we decided to book  and I got the confirmation confirming that we had booked the hotel for the marketed price. However at the bottom of the page (if you scroll down 10 times and with size 9) hidden between other information Booking.com informed that there was a mandatory New Years Eve galla at the hotel of 569 USD per person. That is an extra expense of 2.900 USD!! I tried getting Booking.com to cancel or take on the extra expense. The only thing they did was to try to get the hotel to drop the mandatory galla, and blaming the hotel when I complained. Otherwise they said they could do nothing. Even though this clearly was a trick of Booking.com and not the hotel as the hotel clearly informed about the mandatory galla at their website (I checked after I found out about the false offer). This completely ruined the rest of our trip as the money that where set aside for dinners and experiences now had to go to a mandatory New Year dinner we barely could attend as we had to go to the airport at 4.00am to catch our flight home.  Advise NEVER use Booking.com, and if you do make sure to read every single word on their website if you want to avoid several thousand in extra expenses.        	                1	1	Monday	booking	negative

After a few hours on the street and a lot of phone calls we were offered another apartment, however with a significantly lower standard and price. Since then it has not been possible to get in contact with booking.com as they do not respond to any of our inquiries.

I'm not even talking about taxes, it's stupid stuff like AC fee and whatnot.

1983	"            I decided to book a hotel through booking.com on 20 Dec 2016, with ""semi-flexible"" terms but 30% + more expensive compared to expedia.com (hotels.com) which is non-refundable. After confirmation, booking.com actually charged me 100%, cancellation fee 100% of the amount. As it turns out the ""semi-flexible"" term does not apply to my booking as it's within 60 days, so it's non-refundable.When I contacted their customer service to require a price match refund: 1st customer service told me it's up to finance team to decide; 2nd customer service kept me on hold for 20 minutes, never came back; 3rd customer service finally checked and said they can't match because the terms was described differently (NOTE: although same meaning).And you know booking.com belongs to ""Priceline"" group, which also operates agoda.com and has an operating margin of 35.33% in 2015 ! Because of their oligarchy position, they can do whatever they like to profit. The industry needs more competition !        "	                1	1	Friday	booking	positive

You will get booking confirmation immediately, but after 2-3 days the problems begin.  They will ask you to re-enter the card details and even at this stage don't tell you that you should change to another card. I entered the card details again, without knowing that the problem is ""Amex not accepted"". After few days the same story repeated.The worst thing is that you should change the card within 24 hours or your already confirmed reservation is cancelled. If you are travelling a lot you sometimes don't read your e-mails for longer period than 24 hours. This is what happened to me. How can you ever trust booking.com booking confirmations?

I received an emailed acknowledgement that stated someone would contact me.  Nobody contacted me from Bookings.com so I contacted the accommodation provider direct.To cut a long story short I cancelled the booking through Bookings.com and made a direct booking with the hotel/guest house.I shall never use Bookings.com again and having read some of the posts on TrustPilot believe that I have been relatively 'lucky'I took a Screen Print and I am considering passing this to Trading Standards who, hopefully, will prosecute.        	                8	1	Thursday	booking	neutral

1991	            I have been using Booking.com for at least 3 years now to book holidays and mini break at least 3 times a year. It suddenly dawned on me in September that once again we had to complain about the room we were allocated. On request we were always moved to a better room at no extra charge. In Lincoln the hotel check out staff were so embarrassed about the scruffiness of the room we were allocated that they deducted charge for the dog. I could list loads of examples now that we finally understood what was happening. In Riva del Garda this summer the manager suggested that we book directly with the hotel I order to get a decent room. He said Booking.com charges the, a large fee and that we could negotiate the Booking.com quoted price with the hotel to get a good deal. It was good advice and we shall be trying it on our next holiday. Don't use Bookimg.com. As a side issue, it isn't always possible to tell what the no fee cancellation date is untill about to confirm your booking.        	                7	2	Friday	booking	neutral

Now advised difference would be covered following the tripNo apology and unfortunately a rude advisor who handled our issue. Would be a 5 star if they handled correctly in light of the number of successful bookings I have had - unfortunately, based on what we have experienced please cross your fingers that nothing goes wrong - good website and middle man to accommodation - not much else.        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

2028	            *****I will just show you the e-mail I sent booking.com, I think it explains it all. Do not use booking.com, 3 months after my trip I still haven't recieved the compensation they promised me - it is the baddest service I have ever experienced! *****Dear Booking.comI am writing you because of my experience regarding my booking, number xxxxxxxxx in Rome Suites &amp; Apartments - Navona.This e-mail is going to be long therefore I am just going to start at the beginning. First of all I am very disappointed of the situation when I arrived. When I came to check-in to the apartment I was waiting about 30 minutes for someone to show up and let me in to the apartment. However nobody came and I tried to call the guy who I had rented the apartment from but nobody answered then I called you and had to wait for 15 minutes before I got through to your customer service. They called the owner of the apartment and I was told to wait another 30 minutes for them to get to the apartment. After 30 minuttes when nobody came I called you again and had to wait another 15 minutes to get through and I was then told I was at the wrong address, which I was given by you! Now I had to go to a different location I didn't have a map and you or the owner wouldn't pay for additional taxi fees to get to the new location. I then tried fo find my way to the new location without any luck since I couldn't receive the e-mail from you with the new address. Therefore I had to call a third time again waiting to get through to you and then I got the address. I got the address and found my way to the new location but was only offered a ten euro refund for the trouble YOU costed me! However I will ACCEPT since that's the only thing you will offer me which is completely absurd afterall I spend money calling you and waiting in line, on extra taxi fees and the inconvinience of waiting for hours in a different country without access to a toilet or water. Second I don't understand why the booking price and the cleaning fee is so high since most things in the apartment doesn't work and there is dirt everywhere, it is disgusting! (I've attached some photos, see for yourselfs - and there is more where this came from) it is dirty, ants crawling all over our bed, the shower and the shower curtain is so dirty that the curtain has turned from white to now being brown! The curtain in the bedroom has fallen down and has never been put bach up, the tv is taped to work, the pillows are ripped in the seems, a light is hanging down in it's wire (it's a spotlight so it isn't supposed to), worst of all we can't lock the door because the lock is broken and we are therefore forced to carry important items around and lock our suitcases at all times. The only thing that does work is the internet, are you really okay with that??All in all I am very unhappy with this whole experience! I will never book anything through you again this is beneath what I thought you could allow yourself to take money for. I think it would only be fair to give me my money back!!        	                14	1	Sunday	booking	negative

2037	            I was looking for a nice hotel in Edinburgh that fits my budget and when i finally found one for £157/night (as stated in their website) i immediately proceed to their booking procedure. To my surprise, to the last part of the booking, after i've put all my card details (which they said i don't need to pay anything at the time of the booking) they instantly deducted £297 from my account and they also stated all the room cleaning charges and etc. which was not mentioned in their ads. I tried to call them a minute after my booking to refund my money but for some reason they only gave back £207 after 10 days. I called them for a hundred times for the remaining balance that they owed me but they just keep giving me all false promises and reasons that they are already processing it. It's been a month now and i am not hoping to get my money anymore.        	                1	1	Wednesday	booking	positive
2038	            I have used booking.com a lot for booking hotels and have found them brilliant so I recently booked an apartment in Nairobi through them for my son to stay in while he wrote a paper for University.  The apartment we booked was not the one my son ended up staying in - he was given two apartments during his time - one had cockroaches in it and the other had peeling paint, broken windows, no hot water, and was generally not what we would expect for the money we were paying.  We did not complain at the time as my son was worried about being turfed out onto the street in a city that is not the safest place in the world.  When we complained on our return booking.com were unable to help us, there was no comeback for the person letting the apartment, I was unable to post a complaint on their website and the apartment is still listed - ready for some other poor unsuspecting person to be treated in the same way.        	                3	2	Tuesday	booking	negative

Just before 5pm on Friday before my Saturday check in Booking.com phoned to say that the room had been cancelled.   Two alternative options given for a youth hostel or down market apartment off a dark alley.  This was for a business trip.   Alternative accommodation was three times the figure or just not available so close to trip.  I had to then book my own alternative.  Booking.com blamed the apartment, still trying to get my money back even though no accommodation was provided.   I will not be using them again.  I cannot take the risk.  Prices might be cheap but service is non existent.  Better off booking direct.        	                2	1	Monday	booking	neutral

2045	            On 30th May 2016 I booked through Booking.com a good offer for an apartment (Elite 5 Hotel Apartments) in Manama, Bahrain (2 nights for me and my family). It was a NON REFUNDABLE BOOKING, and I paid everything that day.On 9th July, Elite 5 Hotel Apartments cancelled through Booking.com the NON REFUNDABLE BOOKING: the reason claimed was that the price was not correct. I claimed that at that moment they cannot cancel (with all the problems that they cause me) a NON REFUNDABLE booking.Booking.com recognizes that the hotel didn't act properly but they cannot do anything (¿?), because the price was lower than the rest of hotels in the area (which kind of excuse is that?)...  I insisted several times to Booking.com but finally I had to assume the consequences of their mistakes (if any, because I think they saw the demand was growing up and preferred to sell it again more expensive): the days I should go to Bahrain already passed and we didn't go because when they cancelled my booking, the prices of other hotels in the area where too high so I lost the rest of reservations done.Someone with a similar experience?

According to conditions, this will cost 1/2 the price of the total booking.This is all in all going to cost me both time and money, and leave me unimpressed. I will take this up with Mastercard and rest assured - I will not be using booking.com again - ever.UPDATEI spoke yestersad to a Booking.com representitive who confirmed that there was a problem, but that he would immediately send me an offer to use another hotel in the same location. This offer would include a room of similar or better standard than the one I originally booked, and that a better hotel would be of no extra cost. Within 2 hours of speaking to him I would receive this offer, which I could accept or reject.24 hours on I have received nothing. I have called again, and a new representitive have repeated the offer, and promissed that I will have this within 30 minutes. Guess what? That also didn't happen.Btw - Booking.com advertises that ""They speak your language"". That may be so, but I can't get to speak to any of them.UPDATE NO 2They did cone back with an alternative hotel offer. This would give me a daily roundtrip by car of 2 hours additional driving.

2051	"            I used Booking.com to book a place called Masseria Lama di Coccaro, in Puglia, south of Italy.  We were going to a wedding at the venue next door. We are new parents and it was the first time we stayed in a hotel in Italy with our 7 month old baby.We flew in from Milan, landing at Brindisi, 40 min by car from Fasano. We rented a car and arrived at the place at 3.30pm on a hot Saturday afternoon.When we arrived my husband proceeded to take the buggy out of the car when the owner came out and saw the buggy and the baby in the car seat. Straight away she told us they didn't accept children at the hotel. This is when I grab my mobile, still sitting in the car, that I used to book, to check if this information was actually stated on the hotel page, before being sent away by the owners.Checking the hotel page on Booking.com from my mobile, I could not see the information in the ""General description"", neither under ""Accommodation policies"" (where I read that pets are not allowed), nor ""Accommodation facilities"" nor under ""Important Information"" but only under the section ""Children and Extra beds"", which is where I would have expected information about cots or extra beds (which we didn't need since our baby sleeps in bed with us). We checked other hotel pages and they DID have the information about ""Adults only"" policy under ""Accommodation policies"".We believe the hotel has all the rights to decide who to welcome or not in their hotel, however this needs to be stated clearly and Booking.com has the RESPONSIBILITY to make sure this information is clear.I called Booking.com customer service in tears distraught by the situation and did not get any help from them with either a refund/voucher or help finding another accommodation.During the call the agent agreed with me that this information wasn't stated on the hotel page, only after talking for 5 min did she realize that the information was given but only under the section ""Children and Extra beds"".Quite strange that even them, that look at their pages constantly, cannot find such an important information straight away, then how do they expect customers to find it easily.We were highly disappointed in the level of service that a platform like Booking.com offered, which was no service at all. The third agent I talked to, who was at a higher level than the first two, even agreed with me that they could have improved the structure and consistency of the pages of the hotels they work with.With all of this in mind, we request Booking.com immediate action, a full refund given the confusion and unarguable lack of clarity and consistency on the Booking.com platform along with a formal apology and the adequate compensation.

Today I found the room cheaper and including breakfast. Contacted Booking.com to match but nooooooo. (1) I booked less than 14 days before my stay therefore not price guarantee and (2) I didnt book with breakfast so it is not the same product.Well I guess we can all agree that same room, now with breakfast AND a cheaper price should qualify for the price guarantee to kick in however NOT. I have been a loyal customer with Booking.com for years - thats it - I am going to Hotels.comYes I have read the fine print now carefully and literrally the Price Guarantee is worth nothing if you book less than 14 days before your stay.

2072	            I booked a hotel with them to sleep in the room overnight as I had a layover in Barcelona. My flight got delayed. I called the hotel to let them know and nobody attended. I left two messages on the answering machine. When arriving at the hotel it was fully booked and they gave my room away. I was stuck without a room. So, I took a cab from the airport back and forth to the hotel and paid €45. Just to find out that it's fully booked and they did not honor the reservation.It took me 45 minutes at night to get ahold of anybody at booking.com. After the taxi ride to the hotel and then back to the airport waiting in line with booking.com it was too late to find another hotel. I ask them to refund the cost of the hotel as well as the taxi ride and maybe offer something to cover the inconvenience of having to sleep the night at the airport. After many many emails, the only thing that they offered was to refund the hotel. Nothing else. It was the most horrible night that I've ever had. Sleeping at night in the airport is an awful experience that I don't wish to anyone!!        	                2	1	Wednesday	booking	negative

2075	"            We booked a back-up hotel Laluna Resort in Grenada for our winter travel on booking.com, since we didn't know if we would get to rent a villa right from the start. After the booking in the first week of July, we got confirmation for the villa, so I wanted to cancel my reservation one week later. Strange things happened:1. booked, and it said ""free cancellation until 31st of october"" and ""full amount will be charged during your stay""2. when i tried to cancel the booking one week after reservation, I realised that the whole amount had already left my account!!3. I called booking, who said there was just a hold on the amount, which should be released a few days later - which was a lie!4. talked to another booking agent, asked him to process the refund 2 weeks later because the money hadn't been released back into my account (over 1000 pounds, just saying) - he said, the resort will process asap5. finally got the refund- but with 85 pounds missing!!!6. talked to 3 different agents, delivered them bank statements and all kind of supportive documents 5 times over the last 4 weeks, in order to get the difference back, just to hear them say today on the phone ""oh, that might be your bank fee or the exchange rate""7. SERIOUSLY????? I want my money back, the exact sum I paid for a vacation stay I didn't have, and I will certainly never use booking again, because you guys are only used by customers because you are supposed to make the booking process easier, more transparent and safer, which you have certainly failed (and not for the first time) - as I said in the title, could I give 0 stars or minus stars, I would!

But we received an email from Booking.com on 8th August informing us that the villa we booked ""won't be able to honour this reservation and accommodate [us] on the dates of [our] planned stay"".We have had to cancel everything and, although in most cases were able to get full refunds, we were not able to get refunds on the flights. We were offered alternative accommodation ""at no extra charge"" but when we checked every accommodation offered was originally cheaper than the one we had booked but we were offered no partial refund.The first complaint we made was by phone and I ended up speaking to a customer service representative called Alice. This was on the day we received the email informing us that they could not honour the booking. Despite the fact that we were obviously upset and had just had our holiday cancelled, Alice informed me that she wasn't prepared to listen any longer and then put the phone down. She is clearly in the wrong job and should be fired for her rudeness and arrogance.Additionally the alternative accommodations were all in different areas to the one we had booked.We asked to cancel and have been told that we would receive a full refund (not received to date). We have also asked for compensation for being out-of-pocket but this has been refused.        "	                2	1	Saturday	booking	negative
2077	            Wanted to post a review on this reliable feedback form to help others in finding booking.com and benefiting from their consistently reliable service for finding the best value hotel stays wherever you wish to go in the world.I have looked through many other web sites for accommodation over the years and always end up booking with booking.com.They have far more choice available in each location and their web site is so much better regarding ease of use, information available and reviews for each hotel.It always gives me confidence that I am getting the best value deal to meet our specific needs and I have never been disappointed in all the years I have use the site to book holiday accommodation. They even give 3% cashback on all bookings when you access their site through Quidco. I would highly recommend trying this web site and seeing for yourself how easy it is to use and the great value choices they have on offer.        	                3	5	Saturday	booking	positive
2078	"            Of all the accommodation sites this one feels the most reliable in terms of upfront pricing ( giving you the price for the trip rather than per night ) / volume of listings / confidence that the booking will be fulfilled.I have used booking.com many times to plan holidays... it's fun making lists of potential places and comparing them. I find the results take some working out in terms of what order they are in... you select low-to-high and it seems to put lower prices further down the page still...The thing I find stressful is the ""One room left"" flashing up everywhere and ""Prices have gone up in this area"" messages... I find myself questioning whether they are true or just to pressurise you into booking.Anyway, all in all it is an impressive site, particularly touches like the city guides you get when you book a trip to a famous city.

2084	            We have had the worst experience with this company. I booked our honeymoon to NYC. We booked one hotel and 9 days before we travelled we cancelled it, with the promise of a free cancellation, and re-booked another one. Only to find out we were still charged, daily, for the cancelled hotel. We realised this when our card got declined by the hotel we were staying in. The account had been drained. We called booking.com from NYC and were on the phone for over an hour, they were unbelievably useless and un sympathetic to our situation, they could not help us.  We had no money to get a taxi to the airport and our whole honeymoon was utterly ruined. Now, 6 days later, I get an alternated response email from them asking me to show evidence of the payments! Whilst in New York they made me run around looking for somewhere with Wifi so I could send screen shots of my bank account to them as evidence! The customer service rep also tried to insinuate that it was not the responsibility of Booking.com and was blaming the hotel. At one point asked me to go to the hotel myself! I am furious this hasn't been actioned already and they are asking me again! Its a joke how they treat people. Trust is lost. Do not trust this company. What is the point of a middle man that cannot do their job properly and you need to worry about double checking their work or you get double charged? No refund has been issued, Im completely out of pocket still, 6 days later, no apology, no responsibly taken, no compensation.

2089	            Not only did I have to listen to the rude, uncaring and unhelpful Alex from booking.com but it cost me AUD $30 to phone booking.com (and to receive their pointless phone call back because I was paying for roaming fees), because I had to phone a UK phone number as that was the only number listed on the booking.com confirmation for the hotel we booked through them in Vietnam.  We are quite capable of finding a hotel by ourselves and booking direct, however, (especially due to the fact that we were overseas in a country where we don't speak the language and has different standards to home we booked thorough booking.com with the mis-guided belief that if there were any issues booking.com could assist us.  (the same reason we use it at home, but haven't needed their help before). However, booking.com do NOT help you, they were just rude, obnoxious and unhelpful when I called.  We arrived at the hotel we booked near to the airport (as we had a flight out the next morning) to find that the hotel had no power, no air-con etc. The hotel had not mentioned they had no power (during any of the 3 phone conversations we had with them that morning before leaving our previous hotel) when we had phoned them to arrange a transfer from the hotel we were staying at in the city.  If they had told us they didn't have any power we would have stayed where we were still checked in and got a transfer to the airport in the morning.  However the hotel with no power was more than happy for us to book and pay for the transfer to their hotel through him, without mentioning they had no power. He could have told us that he didn't have power so we could make other arrangements instead of paying for the transfer and then wasting a small fortune on mobile calls to booking.com, then having to find an alternate hotel and pay for transport to the new hotel, all while sweltering in a foyer with no power.  When we arrived the transfer driver unloaded our luggage, called out to the hotel staff and left.  It wasn't until after he had left that the hotel told us they had no power.  We said we could not stay if there was no power and no air-conditioning.  We were of the understanding that when booking through booking.com that we could get assistance.  When i contacted the UK number listed on the booking.com confirmation, I advised the operator that i was calling from my Australian mobile and as there was no Vietnam number I had to call the UK number. He rudely responded that he wasn't in the UK actually. (I don't know why).  Anyway, I advised him of the situation and he said that he could ask the hotel to cancel the booking but he couldn't book me anywhere else as booking.com doesn't do that. he said he could give me names of hotels nearby if I wanted him to, but they don't book rooms. So did I want him to cancel the booking ?  I again explained to him that yes, I do need to cancel the booking because we booked somewhere that has air-conditioning and they don't even have power here, so no we cannot stay here.  He told me that was a bit of an over-reaction ! and that the hotel still has a room available for me.   I advised him that it was almost 40 degrees here.  (We were dripping with sweat standing in the foyer trying to contact booking.com). He continued to be rude to me on the phone before he phoned the hotel to cancel the booking.  We received an email to say the booking was cancelled. He then phoned me again (costing me the rest of the credit on that phone too) was still rude and unhelpful. So, we arranged our own hotel nearby and we will never book through booking.com again.  I know sometimes issues at their partner hotels are out of their control but they are supposed to offer assistance (atleast that's what they say they offer) and there is no reason to be rude. Even if they can't book somewhere else they don't have to be rude. It just made a bad experience even worse.

My wife back in the UK picked up the email and went into melt down not knowing if we were safe. Booking.com have not explained why they sent the email, failed to make an acceptable apology for the stress and anxiety caused to my family and just tried to pass the blame onto other parties who are also not interested. Booking.com emails replies are few and far between and are semi-automated generated so do not address the issues raised. They send a new email every time to break the chain and each email comes from a different person every time. They have now said they will not be replying to anymore of my emails. This company is a disgrace and I will NEVER use them again. I have asked them who regulates them and they said no one does. I strongly advise anyone thinking of using Booking.com to think again.        	                5	1	Sunday	booking	negative

2095	            In April this year my little ones and I went to Brighton after booking a guest hotel apartment through booking.com. Paid £60 for one night at sobo guest house, instead it turns to be the worst mistake to make. Upon getting there, my little ones and I were met by three men smoking drugs outside the hostel that I was misled to believe that it was a boutique style guest house as it implied on booking.com site. There were shards of glass on the ground as a result from a broken window above the reception of the hostel. I of couse immediately cancelled my booking and made my request for a refund through the hostel pathway of procedure...Booking.com insisted that it was my fault as i should've read the reviews of the company in question and I should've called them immediately, and I should've taken pictures.Bearing in mind we'd travelled 5 and half hours to get to this hostel, lost access to my vehicle and clean clothes, littlest one soaked in his urine as our car got locked in HSBC bank car park, had to buy new clothes for the littlest one and nappies and we didn't get accommodation til midnight as it was Easter holidays, all hotels were fully booked unless you're paying top dollars for one. To add salt to injury, I paid a further £159 to sleep in jurys inn, otherwise we would've been homeless for the night and dangerous for a single young mother with two young children.Wrote emails to the said company but no response, sent a recorded letter that cost me £10.74 but had it refused, send back to the sender. Called Trading Standards and Citizens Advice bureau back to back. Til today I'm still fighting to get my money back as they're refusing their part played in this case of me getting misled on false representation of product.Whilst some of the booking.com agents were helpful, but there was one called Claudio that stood out. He was rude, abrupt, inconsiderate, talk over you, insinuate that you're lying, patronising, condescending and out right interruptive agent but insisted he was a supervisor. First I've used their services but instead, it was a holiday experience from hell.Search and book wisely. Don't make the same mistake I made.        	                2	1	Saturday	booking	negative

They also said that they will call back but it never happens.My views of Booking.com and Villas.com are:- They deliberately mislead customers with incorrect information on the website - scammers- Do not check any of the hotels that they represent for quality and service levels- Do not take any responsibilities for the product / services they sell- Make promises on the phone which they do not keep- Customer services team that are not trained to deal with issues properlyI am taking my custom elsewhere and encourage others to do the same!!

They checked and said my reservation was cancelled and there were NO charges. Adding: ""We have made no charges, if Booking.com get money from you, we will get nothing!""

I immediately alerted Booking.com to the error following the £267 that I did not authorise going out. But all they could come up with was to ask the hotel Beni Beach Apartmentos in Benidorm if they could delay the holiday so that we didn't totally lose the money they had stolen! We would have to borrow money in order to do that which would cause us even more significant hardship to us for a very long time to come.I have been emailing and phoning Beni beach accomodation who have been rude and indifferent in their replies and will not return our money.Unless you want to give your hard earned cash away to these unscrupulous crooks then do not deal with either booking.com or Beni beach apartmentos!        	                1	1	Friday	booking	negative
2099	            We have had an unfortunate experience, renting hotel rooms by Booking.com.We were looking for possibilities for 4 adults in Can Picafort on Mallorca and were given several suggestions, which we so chose JS Ca'n Picafort. Here we got two rooms at the same reservation number.This we told my sister, who also wanted to visit Mallorca and now we where 8 people instead of four, so my sister and I did search for some new opportunities and found two apartments in the same area.Then I just needed to cancel my reservation at JS Ca'n Picafort and that was quickly done by pushing the cancellation button - I thought then.Because on my vacation down there, I could suddenly see, that I was charged 100 euros on my credit card and it turned out that only one room had been canceled and we therefore have to paid for the first night in the other room.I schould of course have double checked the cancellation, but who scroll just this to the button, to check on, that a reservation of 2 rooms which were carried out simultaneously, should be canceled by two separate cancellations?Homecoming I spoke with Booking.com and they denies any responsibility in the case and the fault must then be on my bill, which I am somehow disappointed abought.So encourage everyone to be aware of cancellation / change of a reservation, as it can be an expensive experience.        	                6	1	Friday	booking	negative
2100	            Booked for the first time with booking.com. 2 weeks holidays in the US. I live in the UK. I was looking to prepay in Sterling (as I'm used from other sites) to avoid expensive bank fees such as debit card charges for foreign currency transactions. As the prices were quoted in Sterling by booking.com this seems like a reasonable expectation. After I booked the non refundable deal I realised however that payment is not taken by booking.com but by the hotel later on. I will be charged in the hotel currency which means high bank and debit card fees and due to fluctuations in the exchange rate I may have to pay even more in the end. Booking.com is misleading and I won't use it again. I will actually incur around £350 in additional expenses than the prices quoted by booking.com. Not such a good deal after all. I prefer the site quoted in the headline which also have a great rewards program.        	                3	2	Thursday	booking	neutral

2102	            I booked at Rio Hostel in Rome. I am a solo traveler and 68 years old. When I arrived in Rome I went to the address on my booking confirmation. There was no Hostel at this address. The people at that address looked at my booking and confirmed that I was at the correct address. It was already late that afternoon. Do you know what a panic state I was in.  I had no access to internet to find a new place to stay. Then someone took pity on me and helped me. All the decent places were already booked and I had to take what I could get. The place I stayed in was clean but not the standard that I booked at Rio. Then they even had the cheek to ask me for a review on Rio Hostel. Then I also booked at Art Hostel in Bratislava,The hostel let me know they overbooked and that I could not stay with them. I then booked at Patio hostel. When I got home I saw they charged me with a no show tarif. I was in Europe for  70 days with no access to English internet. When I got home I wanted to put in a review on the places I stayed in. It was not possible because they have just a certain time you can put in a review.I wrote them a letter about my experiences and till this day I did not get an apology from them or a possibility to make reviews on the places I stayed at.Book with Booking.com again, or recommend them never!!!!!!!!!        	                3	1	Monday	booking	negative

2105	            To the readers of this, I would never use booking.com again. The reason being is that the price they advertise, the total approximate price, which you click on and pay with your card, you then receive booking confirmation which matches the price that you agreed to pay, is not the price they take from your bank account. They left me £100 short. When discussed this matter with there poor customer service department. The answer I got was this: The price that is advertised is and an approximate amount and not the exact amount that is charge! So when you see best price at booking.com and their website says click here to reserve best price, be careful it might cost you more........        	                2	1	Thursday	booking	positive
2106	            I used Booking.com for the first time, and had a reservation that I cancelled 3 weeks prior to my stay = no costs since it was a reservation that could be cancelled up to 24 hours before.But surprisingly they charged me Euro 131 one month later..... From that point it was uphill to get the money refunded....Sure the website etc are nice, but it's not only the front-end that should be remembered!        	                4	2	Thursday	booking	neutral
2107	            Made two different reservations at the same hotel for 2 different stays and neither reservation was recognized when we arrived. Hotels within a 20 mile radius were booked solid with no availability. It didn't matter that I had booked 4 months earlier and had confirmation numbers. Don't trust that Booking.Com will have a room for you. Call the Hotel in advance.        	                2	2	Wednesday	booking	negative

2109	            I have used booking.com for a few years and have always been happy with the service.. (When booking last minute or in the UK)I Like the fact if you book via free cancellation you can cancel at anytime up to the day if you don't like the change in price.. Non-refundable agreements should remain at the price you book it.. That is how most company's run.. If I pre-order an item off amazon for example! The price is the price I pay and then wait for it to arrive.. Booking.com show you extremely good prices if your booking in advance and Even better if you book as pay now/none refundable.. But.. Its a CON!!Most of the hotels I've booked for my trip have not took the money out of my account even though they can take it at any time! Instead the prices keep going up and up on my booking even though I've technically paid for/agreed the price over a month ago!! the deal for my hotel was 4 nights for 260 originally!! This has risen by 60 pound since the booking..THIS IS THEFT!!!!!!!there is an equivalent room now on there booking site for less than the original price of my room!! at 245 for the same nightsThey will not let me change the room even though nothings been paid for yet and said Im stuck with the room at 320!!  Basically they sell you a hotel room non-refundable and then take their cut handing over the powers to the hotel and are clearly not bothered about their regular customers!! I've booked 20-30 hotels with them in the passed few years and most likely wont use again..        	                9	1	Monday	booking	positive

After that to get refund i have to make atleast 30 phone calls every time different person answering and have no idea about what to do and i keep on asking them when will i get refund  every time they said in 3 days finally i told them im taking company to court, they even not bothered  i was so upset and i did email this problem to CEO of booking.com person called gillian  she even wont reply back i did finally get my money  after all that phone calls and chase in 45 days.

2117	            This is the second time we have been let down by this company so just had to write a review.I booked a 2 night stay x 2 rooms at a 4 star hotel in Italy for June 2016 - Palazzo Rosenthal Vesuview, Trecase, Italy - ( never book this hotel either ) through booking.com, had my confirmation email etc for 2 rooms, 1 Deluxe Triple and 1 Junior Suite.Arrived at the hotel after driving through a slum, went to the rooms which certainly were not luxury or the rooms I had booked, we were given a double in place of a Junior Suite and a suite or family room instead of a Deluxe Triple. Our room the supposedly 'Deluxe Triple' had a pull out sofa bed, metal bars sticking through a very thin mattress.Complained to reception who sarcastedly advised we should have booked direct with them not booking.com and there was nothing wrong with the pull out bed, I said was not suitable for an adult as this was supposed to be an actual bed, they did not want to know. Too tired and too late to try and find another hotel.Telephoned booking.com who said they would speak to the hotel and get back. They emailed me and said the hotel advised we have the correct rooms so asked for photos which I sent then NOTHING, never heard from booking.com again so I telephoned yet again and another person advised they would contact the hotel and either get them to reduce the price or if not booking.com would refund me some money. Checked out 2 days later, had to pay the full amount but booking.com said this may happen not to worry.Have not heard from booking.com since or the hotel despite me following up on my return to find out about my refund and to list all the problems at the hotel, filthy, noisy, unable to use the outside terrace and swimming pool due to a wedding one day and pool being cleaned the next, broken tiles on bathroom floor, dirty grout, stained toilet, and this is a 4 star ????I then advised them both after a week that I would be taking to social media as disgusted by not only booking.com but also the hotel.Will never use booking.com again.        	                5	1	Tuesday	booking	negative

They offered no help or support although it was clear to see what they did. Avoid them at all costs. Rude office juniors. No help.

2119	            booked through this company for 3 nights in Blackpool for 15th June, also booked show tickets for the 15th with another company without problem arrived at the booked hotel to a bemused landlord who couldnt find any booking but showed us to our room, we went to the show and returned at 11pm to be told that we had been booked in for the 29th june which was wrong and that we could stay that night and would have to leave the hotel next morning and we would not get any refund the landlord then told us we could stay a second night and then helped us to get a room for the third night at another hotel which we had to pay for, when we arrived home on the 18th we had an email from Booking .Com stating that on the 17th they had changed the booking to the 15th without any contact from myself, so the hotel got paid £50.66 for a night which we didnt get and we had to fork out £45 for another hotel, needless to say our short stay in Blackpool after driving 320 to get there was a disaster thanks to Booking .Com, also we were booked into a room with a patio which the hotel does not have especially on the top floor room which we were put into, we were embarrassed and feel that we have been conned out of £50.66. its quite clear that by booking .com changing our booking to 15th on the 17th was an attempt to cover up their mistake stay well clear of this agency because they will lie through their teeth to make it look like you gave the wrong dates, we would hardly travel a round trip of 640 miles and do that 2 weeks before the dates that they said I booked and why did they change the date to the correct booking dates two days after we arrived in Blackpool, the hotel can now resell the dates wrongly booked by Booking.com and pocket the money. seems like a con trick to me . they should own up and refund the £50.66        	                28	1	Tuesday	booking	neutral

One was 70 Euros extra than paid.2 hotels when paying upon stay were more than we had been told when booking.I understand there is some city night tax, but not 70 Euros.Upon contacting them, they asked for a screen shot of my bank statement... and the link to the page to do so doesn't work.Very frustrating!        	                9	1	Monday	booking	positive

2136	            Hopeless. VILLA PALMER, PAGUERA. Made a prereservation 3 months before arrival, / just in case it would suit our daughter. It stated flwng on  booking.com reservation site.1. Ingen deposit2. avbokningsbartWe cancelled some hours after-Then on May 06, our daugher was sure she and her friend could afford this visit. So we booked it once more.if I had checked my credit card before that,  I would have understood that Villa Palmer had charged my credit card 02/05, Just a few days after we cancelled the first free of charge reservation with half the amount / 133 euro/ for the cancellation done within 24 hours. Crazy ,  without any customer service. Either it is something wrong with me, friends, and other experts that has read Villa Palmer policies for our first reservation......or maybe Mr Martin and partners from RUSH HTOELS are just beginners? When Booking.com tried to get them to use the amount they had withdrawn from my account, as a deposit,  since we had rebooked the room, 8 days later....( without knowing of all this trouble)..... he gladly told booking.com that he will accept a no cancellation fee, if we cancelled the new reservation now. So we feel as if we are robbed and not paying customers. We will of course cancel the other reservation..... Who wants to stay at his hotel?Booking.com must check their site, regarding this hotel. It said no deposit, free reservation and change....but it was not this. So beware of VIlla Palmer. Paguera Baleares.        	                6	4	Tuesday	booking	positive

I agree with this...they need to check the credit card. But why does it take so long to give it back??????? I come, I pay, I leave. My money is blocked for 3-4 weeks. Do you see anything wrong?I had the same issue on another trip. The money on the credit card was intended for emergency.  I could not use the credit card for the entire trip because the money was blocked...nice surprise!!! If I get one more surprize, I'll stop using booking.
