0	            I recently booked a hostel in Argentina and entered the dates for January 2019 , 26th to 29th January, but before checking out realised that it was only for 3 nights instead of 4 (you have to enter the date you are checking out, as opposed to the dates staying). So clicking on change details, I re-entered the dates 26th to 30th, but  the booking still reverted to 3 nights...I did this 3 times with no success, until I had to close the website down and restart the booking. So I checked the dates again 26th to 30th and booked. The confirmation indicated December dates instead of January. This was a non refundable booking which for 4 people for 4 nights was a big loss to incur. I realise what probably happened when re-trying, but got no joy when speaking to Elaine at Hostelworld and have now lost money for which I don't think is good customer service in view of the very frustrating circumstances. The hostel say Hostelworld take the deposit so they can't refund it.It's not as if I was changing my mind about the dates, but their website that made it tricky. I'm sure they could verify my attempts if they checked and show some goodwill!. Customers beware!        	                1	1	Sunday	hostelworld	negative
1	            Zero or less would be the true rating.I booked a month in advance a hostel in New York at the beginning of October 2018 - the booking was for one week (7 days). When I arrived at the hostel I was told I do not have a reservation and the hostel is full. When I produced my reservation the statement shrunk to 'there are no rooms'. Hostel staff blamed hostelworld for overbooking them and made absolutely no effort to find alternative accommodation for me. Hostelworld did not pick up the calls I maid and did not respond my desperate emails until the next day. I spent a couple of hours on my phone trying to find a place to sleep with no luck. When the phone battery was almost drained I gave up. I went to the airport and flew back to Canada (home).Since then I had several email exchanges with hostelworld. Their explanation is that the hostel's booking system had an error and the booking was not registered - this is in spite of the fact that I received the confirmation and  two reminders about it - could not get a clear explanation from them on how this can be.Hostelworld nonchalantly stated that 'things like this happen from time to time and that's why we reimbursed you' - now isn't that generous of them!Upon request, they gave me my hostel deposit back 6 weeks after the incident.They ruined my vacation, caused me money loss (I had to pay a penalty for airfare exchange) and then brushed me off.Hostel staff and Hostelworld couldn't care less. Lamentable customer service.        	                1	1	Saturday	hostelworld	negative
2	            I posted here on September 13, 2018 about getting a refund on my cancellation credits. A service which I had to pay extra for. I dealt with Elle and Lucy over email since September 11, 2018. I was informed that a wire transfer for my money was sent October 18, 2018. Lucy indicated it was my responsibility to find the transfer as they have sent it. My bank informed me that is false and that the sender has the initial responsibility to investigate since it is much easier to check if there was an error in sending (i.e. wrong account number was used). I am getting a runaround and have since cancelled all bookings made through them.Update December 4: Lucy now says my transfer was sent November 30 after having strong convictions it was sent in October and that it was my bank's fault that I haven't received my money. She is also saying that I requested a bank transfer instead of a credit card refund so again my fault for so much effort in getting my money. I showed Lucy the email trail, she's the one who suggested the bank transfer. It's shameful how people try to lie when it's all documented.        	                2	1	Saturday	hostelworld	negative
3	"            Update on Nov 28, 2018:HostelWorld reply below doesn't add anything new at all.  In fact, my email to them on Nov 11, 2018 (Request #2799939) asking for help still remains unanswered!!Original Review:My two recent experiences with HostelWorld.com tell me this is a worthless, fly-by-the-night company out to fleece end-customers and just make a quick buck.(1)	Experience with HostelWorld.com booking Backpackers Hostel in Santa Cruz, Bolivia:I recently flew to Bolivia but was denied visa-on-arrival and had to return back.  I asked HostelWorld to refund the moneys I had paid and ask the Hostel to do so.  I have received wooden, lawyerly response five times now – none of them helpful in any way.The hostel initially charged me, I left a review to that effect clearly stating the facts, hostel probably complained to HostelWorld so to protect their bread-butter clients, HostelWorld removed the review.  When I complained about it, they said (1) since I didn’t stay, I can’t leave a review (meaning customer has no rights) but (2) the property can still charge (go HostelWorld and your clients, screw the customers!!).  The charge by the Santa Cruz Backpackers is back on the credit card which I have disputed.(2)	Experience with HostelWorld.com booking Backpackers Hostel in Salta, Argentina:To make a few quick bucks and to keep their clients, HostelWorld will list anyone who has four walls, floor, and a roof – the best example of this is Backpackers Suites and Bars, Salta, Argentina.  So many people have left bad reviews stating the facts but no action has ever been taken by HostelWorld.  The dorm bed given to me was so bad I had to upgrade paying four times more to a single room.  Even in that room, there were so many issues that I emailed HostelWorld on Nov 11, 2018 (Request #2799939) asking for help but no one has ever responded to it.  When I left the review stating the facts, HostelWorld emailed me saying:“The information about each property on the website should be accurate and is uploaded by each property individually. All complaints are taken very seriously and recorded.Thank you for your comments as it is through feedback from our customers that we can provide a higher standard of service”.One can only wonder what higher standard of service HostelWorld provides, when they don’t even respond to the email complaint or try to fix anything?  Only higher standard of service provided is to their clients (the properties) and their management, not to the paying guests.Here’s what I plan to do: stop using HostelWorld and start using booking.com and Airbnb, file a complaint with the Mass department of Housing against HostelWorld for putting me in a situation that was dangerous and life-threatening, and dispute the charges with credit card.I invite all fellow travelers to share their experiences here so we can drive such useless, worthless companies off-market.

4	            Very poor experience with this company.  They were going to charge me $536 us dollars for 5 nights for a hostel.  When I called the hostel directly to question the high fee  they told me they could get me a private room for $266 us dollars for 5 nights.  The website might be a good place to explore options but I highly advise booking directly with the hostel.        	                1	1	Monday	hostelworld	neutral
5	"            HW used to be great back in the days when they were still a relatively small ""serving hatch"" for hosteling accommodation. I have been a member since 2008 with around 200 reviews and if you weren't there or have forgotten, don't worry I'll refresh your memory. They used to have a much better logo with the two resting backpackers in a bunk bed resembling a big H. There was a point system, for every booking you make you earn points, leave a review you get more points, with the accumulated points you are rewarded all kinds of perks, like tees, vouchers or a gold card. With this gold card you could book free of service costs (€1.50 each time) for an entire year. And the best things were the periodical deals, there were promotions like three nights get one free, get extra booking credit (to book a rate of choice whenever you want or need it for % off) or book and get free Skype credit. All of these deals are rare nowadays after HW has become a too big player, where have all these deals gone? I haven't seen any in the past 4-5 years? OK to be fair these deals are in general offered by the hostels and there was more variety in the deals such as 50% off a ski pass if you book between dates such and such or book in November get % off surfing lessons just to name something. There used to be a small section where maps/reviews/facilities used to be and HW must have removed that section so hostels cannot promote their deals anymore. The website looked much better and was less flashy, less fashion over function. What does the thumbs up, superb staff or excellent cleanliness mean to anybody? Now all of what I feel was great has disappeared. All my accumulated points have been deleted after the last, of the many, make overs without letting me know. It is just gone without any warning, after being a long member. But what I think is most annoying change is the increased commission fee. Because in the past it used to hover around 5%. I don't know if rates on HW are artificially inflated to shove the commission fees into our shoes or that HW pockets a large chunk of the hostel rates. Because of this new system, I have either booked directly with the hostels in question or switched to booking.com, because what is the point anymore to keep using HW these days? Make HW great again!updated: was pointed out by a like-minded former HW user that it's possible to watch back the old sites with the wayback machine archive (google this). You can go as far back as 2001 to see what it looked like as they keep several records of the old sites. Makes me glad I traveled during the golden years with the gold pass. HW can delete my points and abolish the point system, but they cannot wipe out history.        "	                6	3	Monday	hostelworld	positive

8	"            Absolute worst case scenario: I booked my hostel three weeks before I arrived, received my booking confirmation and reference number, then arrived at 3am to find my booking had NOT been made, the number they provide is not connected and nobody responded to my 20 odd emails demanding urgent assistance (as per their 24/7 customer service guarantee).  I had to contact the Salvation Army to put me up in emergency accommodation as everything else in Melbourne was booked due to the same event I had travelled there for.  Two days later (when I returned home) I found a couple of emails saying ""yo what's the problem?"" like I hadn't clearly explained it in 20 separate emails.  They are now giving me the run around with further insulting responses like ""we can see your booking, was there a problem?""  I've never ended up in such a helpless situation and it was all because of this company a) not booking my hostel and b) not responding to my customer care enquiry.  They did NOTHING.  The Salvation Army paid an $80 cab fare to put me up for 2 nights in a motel 2 hours out of town.  My weekend was completely ruined.  Still no closer to getting in contact without someone at Hostelworld besides generic email responses.  Unreal.  NEVER again.  I've used this overseas and I'm terrified now that this could have happened where I didn't even speak the language or know which local homeless charities existed.  Like you should need to.  Wow.  Mind blown.        "	                4	1	Monday	hostelworld	negative
9	            This company allowed someone else to use my personal email to book in France with a scammed credit card and my personal information. I contacted them to the customer service, by call and email to cancel the account that I never opened, with no results. Warning people!  With this company everybody can use your name and last name to book with a scammed credit card, their system doesn't require any confirmation email!The worst of the worst, I'm thinking to bring them to the court because this IS NOT LEGAL AT ALL AND THEY DIDN'T MOVE A FINGER!Cristian Cappai        	                1	1	Wednesday	hostelworld	negative

12	            Orlaith I spoke to CS Elaine on Facebook.Booking reference 43540-394430157.She is saying that I won’t get a refund cause this booking is non refundable. Hostel staff of Villa Saint Exupery stated they won’t refund me. I only received a reservation number from Hostelworld. No confirmation. I wasn’t sure if I will land a bunk bed in Nice when I get there so I cancelled it and booked another hostel. Usually there is the word Confirmed Booking in there. I wouldn’t cancel this booking if it clearly stated that this booking has been confirmed! After cancelling the booking, that’s the time the hostel charged my card. I have been a user of Hostelworld for years. I’ve done rebookings and cancellations and this is the first time this happened. You and the hostel won’t sort it out. No business ethics at all. I am paying for something that I will not use.        	                4	1	Tuesday	hostelworld	neutral

14	"            No more booking with Hostelworld and I'm warning you against it.They don't help you in case of any difficulties in booking and rarely reply on emails, the all they do is taking their fee for the booking. I made a complaint about being charged by hostel X Bucharest for rejected booking on the base of restriction, which was not mentioned on the page while we were booking. The X Hostel added that information afterwards, but the Hostelworld customers service wrote: ""Please be aware that there is no way for us to check when a property makes amendments to their descriptions."", and when we sent to them the screenshoot of the previous version of the hostel page they didn't even answer to our emails (we mailed for the answer three more times).This is obviously fraudulent practice: they offer something then they change the offer but you can't withdraw your money.

I received an email from the accommodation informing me that the website had not been updated and the dates I had booked were unavailable. They said I would not be charged any money.I contacted Hostelworld several times with these deatails and asked for my deposit to be refunded back to my card, no response.Eventually I did get a reply to yet another email asking me for a screenshot of the email from accommodation cancelling booking.Sent that, several emails later......Hostelworld won’t refund my deposit back to my card only to my Hostelworld account to be used for certain further bookings.I just want my deposit refunded for a booking that never took place. Is that so difficult.The person dealing with my request, Roisin deliberately ignores the fact the booking never got made and just keeps repeating ‘you will be credited with the deposit as credits to your Hostelworld account’I think after this experience I prefer to book direct with a place.

17	            They don't even have a customer service department as far as I can tell. Website works only to allow you to book, but changing bookings, cancelling or similar and it either won't work at all, or it will say it has, and you'll be charged a no-show fee as they haven't actually changed/cancelled your reservation.Feels a lot like an actual scam. Won't be using them for the next 11 months of travelling, and will be telling anyone I meet not to either.Regarding the reply, I did change my booking via the website, but the change wasn't processed despite it saying confirmed. I have been cut off 10 times now attempting to contact the phone line, and the customer service representative who emailed me eventually answering completely different questions to what I'm asking.        	                1	1	Thursday	hostelworld	negative

19	"            This company is absolutely atrocious. I cancelled a booking more than 48 hours in advance of my arrival and they tried to charge me for my ""late"" cancellation (one night's charge).

20	"            HostelWorld states that they have ""no booking fees or unexpected hidden costs""...they charge a 13% commission that they title ""Payable Now"". It appears as though it is a deposit when you are making the reservation. I thought it would be applied to my room rate, however, it was added to the ""Total Cost"" when the room was booked. I contacted the company and spoke with Sara and Lucy. The issue has not been resolved. Would not recommend HostelWorld.com unless you want to pay more than you need to.UPDATE 9.11.18 Lucy from Hostel World contacted me by email and said that if I found the same room for less, I could request a refund of the difference under their ""Guarantee"". I found the same room for 40€ less, submitted the request with photo, it was denied. So not only is the advertisement of no booking fees fake, the ""guarantee"" is also fake.

You also said that I either paid the new price or you would refund me my deposit.

28	"            Hostelworld is a joke.Not only do they make a percentage of your hotel/hostel of choice but they force you to pay a so called ""Deposit"" when booking through their site. I later realised that after staying in my accommodation, the deposit would not be refundable. This is because rather than it being a deposit it is in reality a payment fee for booking through their site. This is a huge amount of money to pay a site and I've never experienced anything like this through other sites. For example: Through this site I paid 66 euro a night for a hotel that would have costed me 55 euro a night (as stated by owner) thereby already making their commission 11 euro a night. Not only did I have to pay commission but had to pay USD 104.99 as a ""deposit"". As I am from Australia this converted to $142 which is basically the price of another night in another hotel. This is a steep amount of money to pay for booking through this site. Absolutely ridiculous. DO NOT BOOK THROUGH THIS SITE. p.s. this is my chat to Melanie who I spoke to about my so called ""deposit"". They are an actual scam suggesting that I have confused the word Deposit. CHAT: Hi was wondering if customers got their deposit back after staying in the booked accommodation without cancelling or anything Chat startedMelanie joined the chatMelanie Hi :) No ,they do not YouWhy is that? Considering it is called a deposit? MelanieBecause it is the deposit paid to hostelworld It is not just a security deposit YouSo what kind of deposit is it MelanieA percentage of the totla amount *total YouSo commission basically? MelanieYes YouSlightly misleading considering you've called it a deposit How much is the percentage exactly? MelanieThis depends on the hostel YouThe more expensive the higher the commission? MelanieOnce you select a room you can see how much you are supposed to pay as a deposit. No, the hostels decide themselves how high the percentage is YouI understand I have to pay just don't understand why it has to be called a deposit if I won't be getting the money back If I had known I wouldn't have booked from hostelworld and would have directly contacted the place Probably should change the word from deposit to Payment to Hostelworld for booking MelanieSorry that you are confused by the wording        "	                1	1	Saturday	hostelworld	negative

I left a review here they responded (someone called Lucy),  if the person who was helping me has not resolved the problem to contact her. I did that and she never replied. No one replies to emails.

This in effect is a con and no company with a decent reputation would be doing this. I do not believe this is an accident. They are claiming that thier website has a choice of booking status when reserving a hostel. This in fact is not true the booking status is set in order to obtain money from your customers to be held by your company and then it is made extremely difficult or impossible to access this without making further booking whereby you take further booking fees. This is a trading standards issue. I have copied my complaint email to my local trading standards and also the UK ECC Services.        	                1	1	Saturday	hostelworld	negative
37	"            Money-grabbing charlatans.  I cancelled my booking within minutes of making it because the US tax was added on to the room price very sneakily at the last minute after I had pressed 'confirm' and had committed to the booking.  I chose a flexible booking option which, like any other website, should mean fully refundable.  They have now told me that the £52 is not refundable but is kept ""on account"" for future bookings, but if not used within 6 months will expire!  They have intentionally misleading T&amp;Cs.  Don't touch them with a barge pole folks!        "	                1	1	Wednesday	hostelworld	neutral
38	"            It is by far the worst booking platform which neither provides good service to the listed properties, nor to the travelers who count on their reliability. Their commission policy, which charges over 20% of the total amount for the booking is consciously hidden from the end customer. Moreover there is an additional service charge - 2 euros. NO ONE who books through HW knows that the so-called ""deposit"" goes to Hostelworld pocket, not to the property.  This is totally misleading the customer's awareness where their money go to. From our experience as hostel owners, we were totally surprised when one of the HW managers  cancelled more than 11 reservations without our knowledge, based on her personal attitude towards us. Another big disappointment is their software which is completely outdated, there is no app for the properties, the password reset procedure takes over 48 hours, which might ruin anyone's business. Moreover, by default one property account adjust its availability not only at Hostelworld, but also at Hostelbookers, Hostels.com, etc. which might lead to a serious problem when a password reset is required. HW Team Leader was totally disrespectful when we addressed to her our complain for an improper customer behaviour, she neglected our case and her arrogance forced us to cancel our partnerhip with Hostelworld.

39	            One of the worst experiences I have ever had. We had booked a room at East Seven Berlin Hostel in Berlin having paid the initial deposit. We intended to pay the rest of the money on arrival, as it stated we could on Hostelworld’s website. When we got to the hostel, we found they had cancelled our booking due to insufficient funds in the account that was used to make the booking, (due to us putting our money into a travel account). Having apparently sent an email to us - which we never received - requesting the money. There was no call to request these funds. We were left stranded in the middle of Berlin with no place to stay at 8pm at night. This left us in a very dangerous situation. We also had to pay an extra €11.30 for a taxi to a new hostel.Having contacted Hostelworld I spoke to a member of the customer service team called Simon. He refused to take on any responsibility and told me that if you look in the small print, hostels can take the money out of your account before you get there. I believe this is completely out of order by Hostelworld to put such a crucial bit of detail in the small print. He then refused to refund the £38.01 deposit that we had paid to Hostelworld, even though the hostel had filled our empty room. We were told by the hostel that this deposit does not have anything to do with them, only the company Hostelword.After this experience I will never be using Hostelworld again, and I would advise anyone looking into using their service to think twice.        	                1	1	Sunday	hostelworld	negative

They have no interest in giving your money back, only interest in taking it. When I cancelled my booking the website claimed I would receive my deposit back in 10 working days, they sent an email confirming this too.

When arrived they were asking 19% more for Taxes. Notice that Hostelworld usually displays final price and have been using many times. So basically they were asking 10USD more. This is a scam because unless you read a fine print you don't know it and hence cannot compare with other websites. The ""Basic Single Private Shared Bathroom"" turned out to be a Pod!

However, it turned out (which had not been clear when booking) that the deposit went to Hostelworld and not the hostel - so I had to pay the full amouunt for the hostel, which meant that I have paid a total of 50 dollars for one night in a hostel. Hostelworld did (after I had chatted with 3 different people/bots on the chat) refund me 18 dollars to my Hostelworld account - however,that is only valid for for the next 6 months, where I have no intention of using a hostel (and definitely not thorugh Hostworld), so in the end Hostelworld ends up with the deposit.

They care little for users of thier booking platforms (hostles.com, Hostelworld.com and hostelbookers.com) and even less for their customers aka accommodations that list rooms on their systems. Travelers always loose commission paid when they book, not a penny of this goes to the accommodation, ever. The onus is on the accommodation to collect any balance due in cash as WRI will not disclose any information about the traveler.Travelers will get a better rate by window shopping on Hostelworld and then booking directly with the accommodation. Accommodation providers should really watch out about cancelations as they will find it very difficult to collect any cancellation charges as Hostelworld.com will not pass on any details to charge the guest.Hostelworld.com is the worst reservation channel.

Although they were ok with a previous issue and I had been using them for years, they were quite rude with this one.        	                1	1	Saturday	hostelworld	negative
86	            I have booked an hostel in Cartagena for the last day of the year. I arrived there and there was no hostel. It has moved to another address, changed name, nobody knew anything. On the same trip i went to Cali, other hostel, they were selling ensuite rooms but there were no ensuite rooms. I have asked immediately for a refund (for both properties). I am still waiting to receive a refund, after a month of emails and texts and pictures of evidence of what happened. After a month, instead of apologizing, they have sent me back just the cover refund of the reservation. Cover refund which I had paid for and which is valid 6months. Basically, it is like a no refund, we don't care about our customers. They don't take any responsibility if something happens. They don't care, they STEAL YOUR MONEY. It is better to contact the properties by yourself or use Booking, you have more guarantees than with Hostelworld. It is silly, because it is rating as GREAT, but if you take a look at all the latest reviews (latest 6 months) THEY HAVE ALL BEEN STOLEN AND THEY REPORTED ALL THE SAME PROBLEMS. Poor customer service, no guarantees at all. DON'T USE IT!!!        	                1	1	Thursday	hostelworld	negative
87	            HostelWorld is basically stilling money from people.My two kids (both 18 years old) and their friend (17) made a booking to stay at Hostelworld in Paris and when they arrived at the place they were told that only 18+ can stay at the place.The thing is that while making reservation nowhere was written under 18 years old cannot stay at their place.When they were told they can't stay there, they asked for the refund of the money for the reservation. And their staff told them they can't get it back.So they take you money just to tell you, you can't stay at their place.Awful customer service. Basically a theft.Fortunately enough, they found another place in Paris, much better for the better price.Will never ever use them again.        	                1	1	Saturday	hostelworld	positive

90	"            We booked through hostelworld in October 2017 for a stay of 4 nights through new year's eve in Cambodia. Hostelworld took their reservation fee. The property, Mama Clare's in Otres village, cancelled our booking still in October, clicking somehow on ""no-show"" - which should be technically impossible, since we wouldn't arrive there until December. Hostelworld did not share this with us, we still believed we had a valid reservation.When we came to Mama Clare's in Sihanoukville, Otres, she told us there was no reservation. Hostelworld offered no help in finding a new room, Mama Clare's offered us a bed to sleep in for one night, and afterwards, on New Year's Eve, where everything was totally overbooked, we were stranded in a village in Cambodia. We ended up paying 250$ more than originally planned, needed to move rooms twice, and had really bad rooms. Being stranded in Cambodia thanks to Hostelworld.com - not good! Getting no help at all, only the strict ""the property will help you"" was horrible, since she wouldn't help us at all.        "	                1	1	Tuesday	hostelworld	negative

They are simply Interested in getting the deposit and offering you no support in any problems you have if the hostel falsely advertises, or treats you wrong in any way. I experienced very fraudekant behaviour from them too which is too long to explain but DO NOT Use them. They will stop replying if it involves anything in relation to refunds, which you may be entitled to. I had to force a charge back on my card to which the bank honoured as it was my right. Appauling I had to take it to that level, hostelworld have no sense of morals and are simply the greediest company I have come across with money that by rights does not belong to them. Always do a chargeback with the bank do not jet hostelworld keep your money, it's a lengthy process but its worth the time to get the satisfaction of your rights eventually.        	                1	1	Thursday	hostelworld	neutral
94	"            Hostel World is COMPLETE TRASH!  A part of me wants to sprinkle all the bad and insulting words I know in this review but in case my future job stumbles upon this one day I will be classy. I studied abroad a semester in Europe and was traveling a lot. My roommates and I planned a trip to Amsterdam and decided to use Hostel world. We booked a 4 person room. The pictures on hostel world showed spacious looking rooms with 2 beds. To book they demanded a deposit of $155 and in total the cost for a weekend stay was 807 euros. When we got to the actual hotel we were upset to find that the hotel room was a shoe box, with one bed. We then talked to the front desk staff and were told that in fact its illegal to have more than 2 people per bed and we'd have to buy another room. I then called and live chatted with hostel world to which they were no help saying simply well you booked it so it's not on us. We ended up going back to the front desk and booking another room which was much cheaper at  144 euro  a night not 269 euro a night. Then I realized the hotel never got the ""deposit"" of $155. That night the window in our room almost fell on a couple of my roommates. I was livid, decided we'd find another place to stay for the weekend! Luckily the hotel felt bad for us so gave me a 807 euro refund but charged me for 2 nights since I canceled what was supposed to be 3 nights plus the one night for the extra room we had to get. This was all on one credit card so I ended up having to spend probably well over $1000 US dollars just to find a decent place for us girls to stay.            Before we went to Amsterdam, I booked a hostel for Barcelona a trip we'd be going on a couple weeks after. After the nightmare of Amsterdam I canceled it immediately. I had to pay a deposit of $46. Spoke to hostel world again about giving me my money back to which they said it's in our terms and conditions. It makes no absolute sense to charge a ""deposits"" of such huge amounts if the actually hostels/hotels never see it. So really they charge you for using their site. BEYOND DISGUSTED AND AGGRAVATED.

95	            Seems to be a reoccurring “respectable” scam with this website - they offer an option to pay extra to for the right to change your dates further down the line (~£10 for my booking). If you know your exact dates then you do not check this option, but when there is a form validation error or dialog the date pickers “reset”, so that on the second form submission the dates are incorrect. Glitch is replicable on Chrome v63, Firefox 1.8, IE Edge. Then when emailing them (in my case, ~10 minutes after getting an email confirmation) you are given a copy/pasted response asking to “cancel” the booking, which would invalidate the request for a refund.If you choose not to do this, and ask for a full cancellation / refund, do not expect a response.        	                4	1	Wednesday	hostelworld	negative

I wanted to use a 60 dollars refund to book a room but I can only pay 2 dollars out of the 60 to secure a booking which means I have to book with them 30 times to make use of my money.

On other occasions when I’ve needed support I called and was on hold for 45 minutes (an international call costing me lots of money) and they cut the phone line off, when I called back I got an automated message to say that offices are now closed, they claim to have a 24/7 helpline - this is false and completely misleading. I would definitely try and sought a different booking sight where possible for your own reassurance that you won’t be waking around in the dark in an unknown area or having to wait for over 72 hours for a response as to why the hostel didn’t have a booking for me and then have to use Twitter publicly as a way to get in touch and only then will they reply because they don’t want people to see they run a bad service.        	                4	1	Thursday	hostelworld	neutral

If you search this hotel on line it is obvious that there have been previous problems with bed bugs. I can support this fact with photographic evidence.

My bank strongly advised me against providing all this info in an email, as I would be setting myself up for fraud. It assured me that there is no way it's needed for the transaction. So I requested the refund on PayPal (safest for everyone, right?) from Hostelworld. But apparently, Hostelworld doesn't do this and unless I provide all the info, they can't give me refund. I think I'll listen to my bank...They messed me around for 2 months and now this. They can go to hell!

115	            I have been using hostelworld for my travels over the last 9 months and I will never be using it again, I highly advise others to book directly with hostels. Here's a few things about hostelworld...- if you write in a review for a hostel, and you mention that the hostel had bed bugs, it won't be published. This is dishonest and defeats the purpose of a review. - when booking, you have the option to have your deposit refunded if you have to cancel your stay. This is not refunded in anyway, its banks through the hostelworld website and there is no way to actually have to money refunded to your bank account.- for some of the chain hostels that offer discounts to members, the prices shown on hostel world is the price with the discount which is very misleading and false advertisement. In our case, we were not members to a particular hostel chain and had to pay 10% more on the total price hostel world had quoted us!I would recommend Airbnb, it's much less disappointing!        	                1	1	Friday	hostelworld	negative

Two weeks past and I sent many emails querying what the situation was and got no response. It wasn't until I rang them up that they actually contacted the hostel. Anyway there was nothing I could do about it and I ended up paying double the price Hostelworld advertised.

I totally understand bed bugs isnt good publicity for the hostel, but if we cant leave a true review of the facts, then what are the reviews for?

223	            the app never worked on my iPhone 6S on initialisation and after attempt to reinstall. forced to use the website version on trips. after making a booking on the web version, tried to save personal information but every time i have to type in again. very annoying. my account does not show the reserved history at all. recently in a booking confirmed in a trip i was turned away, the owner insisted that on many occasions they have no room vacancy but hostelworld failed to update, so they kept turning unhappy customers away. overall i am very dissatisfied with the many defects in your app, your web version and your system.        	                1	2	Monday	hostelworld	negative

Very impressed with this service.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
228	            I've booked through Hostelworld about fifteen times (either I booked myself or one of my trip partners did it). Everytime we got any Problems during our stay, neither with the Check-in nor with the Paying amount. I really like that I can see in advance the facilities the Hostel offers and also a very accurate location of it even in the app. For people who likes travel cheap and comfortable around the world I definitely can recommend this app.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

230	            i totally recommend hostelworld.com, since you can book wherever you want, paying just a small part of the booking. I use it many years, and i never had a problem with any booking. I will definitely prefer it at my next trips, since i have access to wonderful accomodation and i have guaranteed booking by paying only a small part. I must add that I advice the company to keep this deposit-policy and never make the booking free of charge.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
231	            Hostel world have been great to use. The website is easy to use, the webpage of each hostel is detailed and directions to hostels are generally good. I only wish there was a free cancellation and booking option similar to booking.com. And also it would be good to see more detailed pictures of dorm rooms.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive

233	            I have used Hostelworld several times over the years, both in the UK where I live and in other countries in Europe and North America. The system is very robust and you get what you bargain for. The customer reviews section is what I find seperates hostelworld from other service providers as being able to see how experienced and what type of people have reviewed the hostel tells you more than just normal 1-5 stars ratings.        	                2	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

236	            I was told on the website that my prepaid deposit would be deducted from the cost of my stay, but the hostel told me the deposit was the cost of using Hostel World to book and my prepaid deposit was lost.  The hostel also offered free cancellation, but not through Hostel World. It seems to me that booking directly is much better. Besides those problems, Hostel World was fine, but I was very disappointed.        	                1	2	Sunday	hostelworld	neutral

245	            Hostel World is a super easy way to compare Hostel options of a given place over a given time period. The prices may be slightly more expensive at times but that's made up for in the time your save researching hostels and through the security they provide e.g. Flexible deposit. Only had positive experiences so far.        	                1	5	Friday	hostelworld	positive
246	            never had problems with logistics when booking through hostelworld, the hostels receive accurate info about my stay and I now much prefer booking my accommodations through hostelworld than through expedia which was my previous preference. the browser is friendly to use, information is well presented, and the database is wide and deep. I also really enjoy the email hostels send prior to my stay which provides general information about the neighborhood and the facilities. I find additional features can be incorporated into the website to further facilitate comparison across different properties. One thing I found difficult was to compare different room options across different properties - have to go into each property and investigate room options, then exit to another property to see various options - makes location and price comparisons difficult. Another improvement that can be brought is regarding the flexible booking option. As I go through the booking process, the flexible booking option is presented in a way that seems to suggest it's an insurance that would guarantee refund in the case of cancellation, however late that cancellation may be. As I have recently gone through a case of wanting to cancel a stay, I realized that there are restrictions attached even though the flexible booking option was selected. I would suggest that more emphasis on the restrictions be listed at the booking stage to avoid confusion and presumptions.Otherwise, love the website and thanks for the service provided!        	                1	4	Friday	hostelworld	positive

249	            they ask you to pay a deposit for your booking but its actually a booking fee so that you dont get it back after you pay the total on the arrival day and they tell you that there is a brecfast included but actually you dont get anything when you get there. i have booked 3 hostels using this website and no ones gave me a breacfast as the hostworld told me        	                1	2	Friday	hostelworld	negative

The reviews and the ratings on hostelworld make it easy for me to find out how a hostel really is in terms of location, security, socialness, and so on. It has only failed me once, in Ollantaytambo in Peru where two local hostels had the same name because the two were fighting over who had the rights to it. However, I checked when I returned and saw that they had removed the hostel from their site. Hostelworld does it's best to keep updated as real time as possible and I trust them for all my bookings in every country I've been to.        	                3	5	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive

In addition, staff left top marked reviews online in an attempt to cover my review up.

298	"            Usually when I book with Hostelworld, I use the non-flexible booking method.  For once, I booked ""flexible"" and had to pay extra.  Due to circumstances I had to cancel this booking.Hostelworld promised me that when making my next booking, my credit card wouldn't be charged for the 'open' amount.Unfortunately they did charge my card, so still no refund and even not a answer to my email re the plaint.If they don't settle this soon, I'll never book with them again.

299	            I have very much enjoyed all of my travel experiences I have had through Hostel World. The website is easy to navigate and find places in each city you are interested in. It is very important to review what each property has to offer, that way you understand what type of place you will be staying at. Most of the places are a cross between a hotel and a place one would go for summer camp. They are a solid step below most hotels. I also recommend leaving reviews after you stay at a place, as well as reading a good amount of reviews before you choose a property to stay at. Places through Hostel World are very safe - I cannot recommend using them enough for the solo female traveler - they also book well with groups.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive

310	            This organization provides lists of participating hostels in each city. It's an useful service, since a traveler usually doesn't know specific details of places to stay.

As a female travelling alone, safety is very important, and yet trying to have fun and explore can be difficult to achieve in a good way at the same time. The Madpackers helped me with this difficult combo! I could always phone and e-mail Kailash while being away from the hostel and get help/info about how India works. He and his staff helped me book train-, bus- and other tickets/taxis and organized a wonderful trip to Agra and Taj Mahal with other cool travellersfrom the hostel. They also got me a pickup from the airport with a safe password. Fantastic! Also Baddu did a super job with his great non touristic tours of Delhi! Breakfast was good and healthy and the room was clean and quiet. Very very friendly smiling and helpful staff that was so patient with the whole demonetization thing that India just went through.

399	            My name is Mark Cambridge. I booked some accommodation for my friend David Crees using the Hostelworld.com website recently. My friend David does not have access to a Computer so I did the booking for him. The website was very easy to use, the booking was completed within a very short space of time. I would highly recommend using the Hostelworld.com website to anyone.        	                5	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

407	            Hostelworld is such a great website that there is no reason to use any other. It is super easy to use/navigate, so much info is provided on the properties, the reviews are always very helpful, payment process is quick and secure. Communication from the hostels after booking is always prompt. I only have one suggestion, and that would be being able to make multiple bookings at once (eg for different dates) as I quite often book beds for before and after I go on a tour. Other than that, thank you Hotselworld for being so fab!! :)        	                2	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
408	            Hostelworld makes life very easy for budget travelers like me. With a range of filters, user-friendly interface and a very wide variety of options to choose from globally, it always makes planning a trip a lot easier!        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

414	            It's really shameful that HostelWorld doesn't approve the bad reviews hostel receive, because that would affect their business negatively. Tried to publish such a bad review, but it was rejected, as the hostel's rights come before the customer's rights. Bleah.        	                1	1	Monday	hostelworld	negative

416	            Positives: Hostelworld is a good app for booking hostels. It's simple and easy to use their website.Negatives: There is far too much choice of hostels to book from. When I was in a new place, I would've liked much less choice to pick from with just the best quality hostels displayed. I had to sift through a lot of options before I found the hostel perfect for me!        	                1	2	Friday	hostelworld	positive

419	            Have used hostelworld to make a number of bookings during our travels. We have had multiple issues with booking and cancelling flexible bookings. We have been left without accomodation and unable to get in contact with their 24/7 service. We received one response which was a copy and paste of the FAQs. I would avoid using this service and contact hostels directly for customer service.        	                1	1	Wednesday	hostelworld	neutral
420	            I typically don't like receiving spam-like emails. However, Hostelworld.com is amazing at sending me amazing deals around the world. If you are in wanderlove, you need to be on this site daily, if not, weekly.        	                1	5	Saturday	hostelworld	positive
421	            Found booking with hostelworld very good. Was good to have all the hostel ratings, prices and locations side to side. There was no issues with the bookings and the description on the site was accurate.        	                4	5	Thursday	hostelworld	positive
422	            Hostelworld has illegally given all of my personal information to TripAdvisor, including all of the locations of the hostels I have booked throught them. This despicable act is in violation of my privacy.        	                1	1	Thursday	hostelworld	neutral

427	            Details need to be more accurate on hostels. Very rude on the phone. Both women I spoke to ensured me that they would work on the problem within the day. I have called twice and nothing. It is as if no one at the customer service wanted to deal or help me with my problem concerning the hostel price. Plus, no 1800 number to call. I spent more money on a long distance call to Ireland than the amount of money in dispute. I called the Hostel, they blamed it on Hostel World. Then I called Hostel World, and they blamed it on the hostel lol. They also take about 24 hours to get back to you, and I have to continue to call to ensure they are actually doing something about it. Do not recommend. Booking or Orbitz is much better and are willing to cancel in case of an issue. Hostel World could care less.        	                1	1	Wednesday	hostelworld	negative

433	            Fantastic site, everything on one place. You can read about every hostel in the city on this site (not just hostels but also apartments which you can rent in the city). Definitely no.1 site for booking your hostels no matter where you are. Thanks :)        	                1	5	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive
434	            Hostelworld is great for looking and seeing the hostels in a location and getting an idea of the price but we've started noticing that there is often no rooms left on hostelworld but when you physically go to, or call the hostel, there is space.

447	            For the past four years now I always book my hostels through hostelworld during my travels.

449	            Hostelworld is the only app I have used to find hostels in Asia and Europe. It's easy to use and has a massive selection of hostels.

455	            It is good and worth paying as far as I experience. Anyway, one thing that you will have to bear in mind is sincerity. Only will one bad service destroy all good things that you have done.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	neutral

458	            Hostelworld provides affordable lodging opportunities around the world, making it possible to go places that you thought were unattainable. Knowing that I have the opportunity to stay in a quality hostel originally gave me the courage to travel alone, which I do to this day...just returned today from a week on the Amalfi coast. Users also regularly provide reviews, which is invaluable as you searched for the type of place best for you.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive

460	            The location and staff of this hostel are lovely. It's just a short ferry ride (which is free and runs constantly) from the train station and the city center. My only complaint is the cleanliness. The showers especially were not clean at all. It looked like they hadn't been cleaned in days- there was hair and dirt all over the floor. The sinks weren't very clean either.        	                1	3	Monday	hostelworld	neutral

463	            Didn't have any issues with my reservation process. The reservations were easily accepted by hostels and make booking reservations for 3 different stays over 8 days extremely simple. The booking process takes about 2 minutes, and their comprehensive reviews are a critical part of our research making for an excellent trip.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
464	            Booked my New Zealand trip fully via Hostelworld. Hostels were categorized accurately by states, and it can be sorted by ratings. Each hostels comes with many reviews so it is easy to know if the hostel lives up to its rating. When my booking was getting near, i'd get a reminder along with weather forecast and place recommendations to go. Overall experience using Hostelworld is great! The app though is a little slow when it is first opened, not sure why.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

472	            I'd definitely recommend Hostelworld because it's very user friendly, trustable and whenever I had any problem they tried to solve it as soon as possible. The app is great, makes easier all the booking process, but sometimes has some bugs (iOS), worth some improvements :)        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

I also love that I can read a variety of reviews and ratings for various aspects of each hostel.  There is a huge variety of hostels to choose from as well. I once needed to contact Hostelworld about an issue with dates and I had a fast response and resolution. They were very helpful.

517	            I think their cancellation policy is tricky and unfair.  I paid extra for this 'flexible deposit protection' and had to make a change in my booking and in this process lost $10.24 which can be refunded only for the online deposit and not for the actual booking payment.        	                1	3	Monday	hostelworld	negative

522	            direct quote from the hostelworld website:' if your booking details cannot be found at check-in, we’ll credit your account with your full deposit AND an additional $50 towards future bookings'.this happened to me, had 2 bookings that were lost due to a 'glitch' and hostelworld DID NOT honor the guarantee.this is fully documented, and completely unambiguous. clearly hostelworld did not honor the guarantee.the help desk did readily admit full responsibility.- but then refused to honor the complete guarantee. this problem created much difficulty and large expenses to find alternative accommodation on very short notice.not good.have all records and complete documentation.daniel        	                1	1	Monday	hostelworld	negative

533	            As I am travelling for a few months, I have used Hostelworld a lot to book hostels. It has been very useful going to one website and being able to access a number of hostels, their facilities, reviews etc. I have not had any major issues or problems with any of my bookings, although I see the chat option is there, should I need it. Some things about Hostelworld that I feel could improve are : Being signed in all the time, rather than having to do so everytime you open the website or app. Have a comments box when booking for the hostel you're booking with.Overall my experience with Hostelworld has been very positive and I would definitely recommend them.        	                3	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive

They asked me to mail the query. I mailed hostel world about it but didn't get any reply for a day.

584	"            Thanks to Hostelworld, my husband and I found two great places to stay, one in Prague (Antik Hotel Prague) and one in Budapest (Feodorm Hostel and Apartments).  The Antik Hotel is a an actual hotel with a restaurant and breakfast buffet:  great place in a great location.  Feodorm is bare bones, hostel type situation, but we got our own room with ""ensuite"" bathroom and shower, in a great neighborhood, for under $50 (U.S.) a night.  At that price, Feodorm is naturally no frills, but it is cleaner than thou; very safe; and in a very nice area.  I highly recommend Hostelworld for putting us on to these two great places.

587	            Awesome way to compare hostels and find the one that suits your exact needs! Being a first time traveller in Europe, it's been a very important part of my planning and exploring.

594	            I've been using Hostelworld for about 8 years now, and it is still first on my hit list when looking for vacation accommodations.  I've always found the reviews to be both honest, and insightful, and house no hesitations booking through this site.  As my requirements (read budget) have changed over the past 8 years, Hostelworld has continued to provide me with multiple options (and plenty of reviews) to suit my needs, and requirements.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	neutral

The fact the sponsored hostels go to the top and mid way through results is counterproductive, as often they are outside the search parameters and cost more than their counterparts. Despite this, Hostelworld is ever reliable and remains an integral string in any traveller's bow.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive

615	            I almost always use this website to book hostels, and I stay in hostels at least once a year. I travel a lot with my mom, and it's very important to me that we stay in places that are safe and clean. We aren't interested in breaking the bank on a hotel room that we won't even be in unless we're sleeping. Hostelworld.com has always steered me in the right direction. I like that I can search by rating or price, the pictures are helpful, and the maps are also great.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

639	            Making a reservation through Hostelworld.com was a right and easy thing to do. It solved my primary problem of finding a lodging in London on a quick notice. A reminder sent to me two days before travel was a fine touch (I did not remember to activate it).Overall - a very useful and neat place. Will definitely use it the next time I travel somewhere.        	                1	5	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive
640	            The system is easy to use and there are a lot of options. My only request is enable users to book multiple hostels before checking out so that users can enter payment information once, instead of for each hostel.        	                1	4	Tuesday	hostelworld	neutral
641	            Two weeks prior to where I was going to stay I was contacted by the hostel I had booked for - they told me that they had terminated their relationship with HostelWorld for various reasons and that HW should have been in contact.  I was told that my reservation could not be upheld through HW and that I would need to rebook my reservation directly through the hostel.The email from the hostel was the first - and still is the only - time I ever heard about the termination and that the reservation would not be able to be upheld. Had the hostel not contacted me I would not have known at all.Furthermore, when I tried to contact HostelWorld they only answered my initial email.  They asked for a forwarded email that I had received from the hostel and then never replied to me again.  I sent many emails over the span of a week without any response at all.I also tried calling the number on their website to contact them and was continually met with 'The number cannot be dialed at this time', for some reason.  The number never worked and I could never find another number to use.Overall, I have seen the horrible customer care that HostelWorld provides.  They clearly ignored my attempts to resolve the issue and showed blatant disregard for my questions and for me as a person.I will definitely never be using this company again and will be making sure that no one I know uses it either.        	                1	1	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive

643	            My biggest problem with Hostelworld is that they got rid of the points system that could be used to earn gear/swag.        	                1	4	Tuesday	hostelworld	neutral
644	            I like to use Hostelworld because I feel that I have some basis for trusting in the quality of the hostels on their site. A blip has cropped up in terms of the deposit. Make sure that you know how much you should pay on arrival. I've had three instances, in the past month, of the deposit not having been taken off when I arrived at the hostel. When I mentioned it it was sorted out immediately and without question but it's weird and you should watch out for that.        	                1	5	Tuesday	hostelworld	neutral

679	            I've been using Hostelworld for a good 10 years. After every booking and subsequent stay, you ask my opinion of the hostel (valid) and ask about my experience with your website (pain in the behind).Seeing as I've booked through this site so many times, clicked through your tedious links and waded through your spam, how about a loyalty scheme, eh?Now eliminating your competition, it is hard to undercut your service. Many times I've found hostels for cheaper through booking in person, and must source new methods for booking. As I said, you people are so annoying with your incessant emails and reaching at my opinions. Anyway, till tomorrow,Oliver        	                1	3	Friday	hostelworld	neutral

Hostelworld is easy to use and it has everything that you need to find a good hostel.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
766	            Tons of great experience and reviews are shared about just about every property anywhere. Great way to figure out which hostel to stay in, particularly in cities where there are many choices. Also a reliable place to book reservations. I use it all the time, and have done so in many countries.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

769	            I love this company they are great and treat you well. But sometimes the navigation of the app is a little tricky. And not the easiest to figure out. Im sure there is a way to make it a little smoother for the customer but overall it is great and I love using hostelworld.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

771	            50+ year old staying in 3/4 star rated accomodation. Used Hostelworld for a 3 weeks trip to Vietnam and Cambodia.The Hostelworld app was invaluable as it lists bookings in chronological order rather than the order booked. This makes it simple to know your next location. Even after 3 weeks away it's not easy to keep track of those 'cast in stone' moments.All the places we stayed in have pretty much matched their star rating.        	                3	5	Monday	hostelworld	neutral

773	            Hostelworld had a hostel listed on their website with good ratings, but when I showed up to the hostel it looked very inactive and dilapidated. It was under extreme construction and had nobody working there. I, then, had to pay a taxi to find another place that was actually in operation.        	                1	1	Monday	hostelworld	neutral
774	            Hostelworld.com offers an easy-to-use online search capability. It is one of the best way to make comparisons of hostels. It is very informative and makes it easier to make an informed decision on where to stay during travel.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive

777	            Hostelworld.com makes easy to find the best accomodation all over the world. Only one thing could be better: there is no option on the search interface, if I would like to book a room with separate beds. For example a double bed counts as two beds, which is not the best if you would share the room with colleagues or friends (without benefits ;-).        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive
778	            I would always reply on hostel world to give me the best reviews on places to stay. Would definitely recommend people to trust and use hostel world to give the best options to people.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
779	            I've booked hostels over most of in Japan and Thailand so far.  Generally speaking, Hostelworld has been a great companion.  It's helped me find accommodations last minute fit a fair price.  Most hostels provide a bevy of pictures and all the pertinent info one might require.  The reviews tend to be accurate as well.Feel confident in Hostelworld's service and explore with peace of mind!        	                1	4	Sunday	hostelworld	positive

782	            Hostelworld is my first stop for booking hostels because it is easy to use and has tons of hostels in its database. The various filters and sorting tools allow me to refine search to better suit my needs.

783	            Hostelworld is very helpful and I am using it often when I am travelling. The handling is easy and you can get very quick a good overview about availabel accomendations. There are just a few things that could be better. I would prefer not paying a deposit in advance for example and sometimes the system does not accept my credit card, even if I booked another hostel with the same card just a few minutes before...        	                1	4	Thursday	hostelworld	positive

797	            I have been using Hostelworld for about 6 years. It is good because there are a lot of hostels so many cities all over the world. The app is really easy to use. The customer service is just a little annoying because the chat option doesn't really work and you have to email. The flexible booking option is not straight forward how to make a change. Those are the only problems otherwise would give them 5 stars.        	                1	4	Tuesday	hostelworld	neutral

806	            Hostelworld are fantastic no matter what type of accommodation you are looking for. I've used them in several different countries now and am yet to be disappointed. The only thing stopping me giving them 5 stars is an experience I had in Italy where I needed to extend my stay. I requested through the website and everything was confirmed yet when I arrived at my accommodation they had not received anything from hostelworld.

845	            I've been using this service for a few years. I like that it has an option of insurance to get the downpayment back if I cancel a booking, and the convenience to pay in various currencies. The choice of accommodation seems to be quite good. What I don't like is the notification popups in the browser that tell you for a selected hostel that it was booked so many times today as they slow down the page loading times considerably.        	                1	4	Friday	hostelworld	positive

857	            Hostelworld is a great service, the reviews, photos and comments make booking a hostel so easy. And it avoids any unnecessary surprises. The only issue I have is that the 12% deposit is too high. That is a large chunk of income for small hostels. It is clear the amount of trade the website does (as it is so good) surely they could lower the rate that they charge often independent businesses.        	                1	4	Wednesday	hostelworld	positive

886	            Travelers are a community.  We depend on each others' information and experience to make good decisions... when a hostel has bedbugs, that is good info to have.  Hostelworld does NOT post this sort of info, they actually actively cull it because it can really harm a business.  I understand that, but if you're looking for more options, good service, cheaper prices (on occasion) and real info, I suggest:  booking.com        	                2	3	Thursday	hostelworld	positive

889	            Hostelworld is a great way to find hostels around the world. The traveller reviews help you to get a feeling for whether the place is good for you. The only thing I found out this trip that I don't like is that your booking can't be amended. You can cancel and rebook but not change arrival / departure dates.        	                1	4	Wednesday	hostelworld	positive
890	            The reviews and information on Hostelworld make it so easy to make an informed decision and book a hotel all at once. The only downside is you can only make a deposit on hotels, you can't pay them in full and will have to pay when you arrive to your destination. However, it is so easy to find great, clean, safe hotels and hostels for a great price! The reviews are super helpful for this.        	                1	5	Wednesday	hostelworld	positive

893	            I used the company app to book two hostels in Munich. The first hostel was nice, close to the central train station and clean. However, the second hostel was disappointing to say the least, simply because there was a big issue with hygiene in that hostel. The biggest problem, for me at least though, is that after looking around, I realized that there are other people that have also complained about the hygiene in the Laim hostel and it seems that those comments have not had any impact and they have been ingored.        	                1	3	Tuesday	hostelworld	neutral
894	            I have used  hostelworld every time I travel in Korea. Finding the hostels on the maps or by type makes shopping for a place to stay feel easy. I have never had problems with the site or the hostels I have stayed at. Sometimes the site and the hostel haven't communicated well and things are a bit confusing, but things always end up fine. The mobile app is nice to have while traveling as it gives you hostel info, maps, and reservation numbers.        	                1	4	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive

897	            Ever since I started traveling, I've booked hostels and guesthouses via Hostelworld. I love the fact that we don't have to pay 100% upfront and that our booking can be edited, and have an option for flexible dates.Whenever my friends ask me for tips on where to book accommodations, I always recommend Hostelworld as I trust their network of accommodations. Features of the site are very helpful - hostel description, photos, user reviews of the hostels, and the location map that serves as a guide on where each hostel is located to help me find a base!        	                1	5	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive

Also very helpful with check in process and ordering shuttles. Perfect place for a group of travellers but not social enough for a solo travel as there is no common room. 2 negatives - not anywhere near enough power points in the room. There was 1 in my 4 bed dorm. Wifi was pretty bad within the rooms. I'd stay here again if I was travelling with a friend but not as a solo traveller.        	                1	3	Monday	hostelworld	positive

936	            I once had an unpleasant experience with a hostel I booked through hostelworld and I wrote a honest review after my stay but the site was holding my review until I wrote an email and ask why my review was not published. Besides, some of the hostels I have booked through hostelworld have photos that do not match the reality. I know this is not the site's fault but this can easily be improved by allowing guests to upload actual photos of the hostels like some other travel sites? The review word limit is also not enough. Also, it will be much more convenient if I can make multiple bookings and pay together.

957	            This is a very nice hostel in an excellent NYC location.  It is very clean.  You will pay more for this hostel than others, but less than most NYC hotel rooms.  The decoration is modern and the bath facilities are located adjacent to the rooms.  The beds are comfortable (six bunks to a room) and the bed sheets/blankets are fairly new.  Even bunk reading lights are provided. The bath showers/sinks are new.  There a spaces to sit and rest, read or eat. A small breakfast of toast with jam and tea are included in the price.

973	            The hostels offered on Hostelworld are reviewed by the users - so there is a fairly democratic way to judge quality. The policy of cancelling and late arrvial etc. is also good. I usually can identify fast the degree to which a region is tourstically developped- the less hostels- the less developped. So it is not only a booking site but also a great source of information- for example their handy mini-cityguides.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

990	            Lot of optional for hostels. Although, there's also a lot of great ones that are not on the site. Booking is easy, no complains on that level. Although, sometime hostels offer more option ornate beds than what's proposed on the website. Like double and queen size dorm bed. You have to contact the hostel directly if you want to book those, and obviously, the prices are not the same. A bit of improvement on that level would be nice!

991	            Some really relevant information was missing as the fact that after 6 PM I was only allowed to check in on the store next to the hostel. I found everything very disturbing and not usual at all for hostels. I've been to many, in different countries and have not ever met such a treatment of having no one to welcome you. It was all very impersonal, cold and weird. The checkout, I simply had to drop the key on a box. I have not encountered a single person/staff from the hostel the 3 nights I spent in Norrkoping. It was a bad impression... and I had such a great experience in a hostel in Stockholm. Apart from that, the room was beautifully decorated, it was offered decent food and the common areas were lovely, including the bathroom that was alwasy clean.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	neutral

1015	            Earlier I wrote already about the sky high depositrates (running up to 20 % which means the hostel has a loss), now I booked and noticed the exchange rate is booming business: instead of 1,11 euro to british pound they charged me 1,18. Since I did not notice -just afterwards checking my credit card account-  I lost a Approx. 10 euro on total (I booked several hostels upfront) Hostelworld is Irish, like Ryanair, and has the euro so no way they are allowed according to the rules to calculate in this way.By the way: Ryanair did the same, resulting in another loss of approx 10 euro.        	                12	2	Wednesday	hostelworld	neutral

1017	            I've been so disappointed with Hostelworld, the price payment were not constant with price stated and not honor price payment after booking online. At the end of my stayed, payment were charged double from guesthosts. Oh, when trying to do booking hostel online, it always appears to be full. But when doing a walk in, it than appears to be many beds/rooms are available. Dishonesty, service and faults advertisement. Especially, my experience with Reggae Guesthouse 1, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Guest host customer service from Alvin. Bed bugs are really a bad problems at many hostel stay. No regulations or inspectionts to fellow through with health hazard. I feel that Hostelworld also have a big part and responsibility to make sure that guests, booking online have the right to know that they are staying in a clean and safe environment. These are serious issues and for public health safety. For guests, rather they are paying five dollars or thirty dollars per bed or room, they have the right to know for their safety, health hazards and clean environment should be a top priority and be address.        	                1	3	Wednesday	hostelworld	neutral

1043	            Only site I use when booking hostels. 3 months travelling throughout Europe and hostelworld has helped so much with their maps of locations, directions and scarily accurate users reviews. Have had no issues when arriving at hostels booking through a third party site and payment hasn't been easier. I won't use any other hostel site!        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	neutral
1044	            it's a good and smooth website, some countries there is limited options maybe in those place  Hostelworld should put more efforts.also to be different from other hostel websites you're suppose give promotions, secret deals, points, or a percentage off for those who book more than 10 nights a year or so.keep it upcheers        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	neutral

1046	            The good, the bad and the ugly. Hostelworld can help you find whatever you're looking for in a huge range of prices. It's not just hostels either. Their rating system combined with a great community of folks constantly publishing their own reviews keeps Hostelworld's info useful and up to date. Always read people's reviews before you book, you won't regret it.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1047	            I am very grateful that Hostelword exists, as it is the main way in which I find accommodation while backpacking. The reason for this is the honest reviews from travellers who have shared their experiences, as well as the overall ease of use of the website. I once had to contact the Hostelworld team directly with a request for assistance, which was handled quickly and without any dramas.There are some glitches in the app, I have not always been able to view all my upcoming hostel bookings, and it does not stay logged in sometimes, so I do hope these issues will be addressed.I tend to gravitate more towards the website (on my laptop) rather than the app to actually make bookings and reviews.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1064	            boderline agressive on reviews requests, especially with hostels you've been to already. Consider that a customer who has already rated 5 hostels in a month may participate enough to the community, no need to send 10 reminder emails and a thank you email after.

1065	            Honestly, I wouldn't attempt to book a hostel through any other site.  Their reviews are dependable, because they require a stay before reviewing a site - you're hearing from people who actually stayed there.

They do not charge any fee. With hostelworld you have to pay extra to insure a cancellation. Once you cancel according to the cancellation policy of the concerning hostel you only get your deposit back if you book another hostel through hostelworld. Ik find that a bit of a scam. Once I realized that I stopped making reservations through hostelworld. As I find the site of hostelworld  more clear than Booking.com, I used hostelworld to search for hostel and then I booked them through booking.com (no deposit necessary or payment for an cancellation insurance).        	                3	4	Monday	hostelworld	neutral

Especially considering I'll have stayed in probably 20 hostels by the time I leave. Also, when you enter the date into the top of your search, it doesn't stay very long and within a few minutes I have to gag he it again. Additionally, the way you mark ""only two beds left"" for the longest time made me think that all of the other options with no ""only xx beds left"" we're booked. Some other people in my program thought that too but we eventually figured out that meant they were completely open. I wish I could have known that a long time ago because I could have actually stayed where I wanted. Otherwise, good site. Thanks!        "	                1	4	Wednesday	hostelworld	positive

I do not feel that comments have also been paid attention to when leaving comments requested for hostel world. Comments left include those above and the main fact that total costings are not always accurate, IE when saying '""all costs include taxes"". We have then often been hit with additional costs/taxes (usually in Italy which are noted on the accommodation website). This is not helpful to those travellers especially when being hit with 21euro (IE stella b&amp;b in Rome). This is false advertising and statements made by hostel world, and it is not up-to those requiring accomdation to pay for accommodation providers fees!

1129	            I always book with hostelworld. It's the best page to book hostels with and also good because of so many users that mean a lot of helpful reviews as well. It's always easy and super quick booking with hostelworld.        	                2	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1131	            In about 90% of cases in my experience, Hostelworld connects with each hostel before guest arrival, accurately sending information about number of guests, preferred room types, etc.  In speaking with each hostel where the info. WASN'T accurately communicated, it usually seems to be the fault of the hostel themselves (they have a paper system, their systems were down due to local weather, etc.).  Although Hostelworld's booking fees are often higher than their competitors like HostelBookers, I've found they display a larger pool of hostels, and tend to better integrate with them.The Hostelworld Android app occasionally has a bug where it *changes your travel dates on its own*, without notifying the user.  Once this starts happening, the only solution I've found is to use the traditional website with a web browser.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1134	            I traveled 2 months through Europe, 14 cities. I booked all my hostels using the app, all the reservations were smooth and 90 percent of the hostels were awesome. The reviews were right on spot. Excellent service.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1137	            It is a clean website, where you find exactly what you are looking for pretty quickly. I first used Hostelworld for a trip I did where I had to book 5 hostels in different places, I was not disappointed in any of the hostels I stayed at, it was pretty much what was expected according to the information available in Hostelworld.They even have customer service where you can phone them, and I noticed that the bookings and movements information I did in the website was practically immediately available for the hostel as well, so no space for confusions between any of the parts involved.100% recommended, I'll definitely plan my next trip with Hostelworld again.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1163	            Hostelworld is very convenient for backpackers. The prices are honest and the bookings are well managed. The only drawback is a pre-payment from the creditcard and the second part upon arrival, which makes it not really clear for the personal accounting.        	                4	4	Wednesday	hostelworld	neutral

1190	            Stayed at the Gorge View Hotel in Niagara Falls NY for the weekend of the blues festival. Well located in relation to the falls and the festival, which was held right downtown. It is also just steps from the Niagara gorge. The area right around the hostel is a bit dodgy so some may feel uncomfortable coming and going late at night, especially on foot. We were a group of 4 guys with a car, so had no issues in this regard.Great value for our money. The facilities are clean and comfortable, while staff were very helpful. I would definitely return in the future.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1198	            Hostworld was an ok site to work with but none of the information from the app worked offline and it was difficult to pull information regarding the booking from the app. Traveling internationally I don't want to use a bunch of data just to look up information about my hostel which made this a very frustrating experience.        	                1	3	Monday	hostelworld	negative

1201	            Hostelworld was a great way to find places to stay as we traveled through Europe. It was easy to navigate, read about the different places and see what other people say. Paying was easy as well, just took a little bit to figure out who owed what after paying the deposit if you are traveling with more than 2 people. They show deposit in USD (what I paid in) but the rest of the amount in Euro so trying to do the calculations was a bit tricky. Only other thing that could get better is when reviewing the places that you stayed, having at 10 point scale instead of a 5 point. Some places you could over rank or under rank because you want that middle number but can't use it. Great website overall, definitely would use again to find rooms to stay in.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1219	            Booked on hostel world for 3 person room.  Got to hotel and was told the room only slept 2. Ended up paying nearly double to get a second room so we could all sleep.  Decent hotel but very thin walls. Heard *everything* going on next door...not appropriate if you have kids with you!        	                1	3	Monday	hostelworld	neutral
1220	            The hostel was clean and staff was helpful when asking for directions and information about the city attractions.  Only stayed one night tho and checked in very late around 12 midnight. There were no sheets available when I arrived so only got a clean towel. The common areas were very clean including the shower and restrooms.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1221	            Easy to make reservations, had no problems with the hostels, checking in, or anything.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	neutral

1226	            In the 6 bookings there was only one snafu, where our reservation, which had been confirmed, was cancelled. That caused some worry for us at the check-in, but they found a room for us an it worked out well enough. The other places all went smoothly were easy to find and were clean, friendly and in many places quite beautiful.  Hostelworld gave us access to places that I doubt we would have found in other ways and helped us take an affordable and enjoyable vacation.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1243	            Been traveling around the world. Use hostel world most of the time for booking places to stay. Never problems. Even canceled a reservation once and no problem getting credit for future use!        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	neutral
1244	            This is the best website I've used to book my hostels. Layout, ease of use, quality of bookings and range of hostels is always great. Once or twice I've been emailed by hostels after posting a low-rated review and been offered money to remove my review. So, a bit more anonymity in review postings would be useful to ensure all the reviews we see present a good picture of the hostel we are looking at.        	                2	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1245	            I  slept in a big dorm with 16 people and they weren't any windows, not even in the common room. The kitchen only has a microwave, so you can't really cook a real meal. The  staff running around was not greeting or smiling or anything. So there wasn't a really nice atmosphere, most of the people sitting in the silent common room alone looking at theire smartphones. The showers and toilets are really modern and there is a train station and a Netto really nearby. The breakfast you can book for 70 Krones is fair and tasty. But altogether I wouldn't come back to that hostel!        	                1	2	Monday	hostelworld	negative

1274	            Hostel World is a great booking site for hostels, but not only.

1276	            Hostelworld is working better than a few months ago but, for exemple, you should assume the acounts with the email,like the Booking does.

1287	            Hostelworld is OK to use especially when you are doing the big Cities, but it fails when you are looking into smaller places. Often Google Maps is more helpful for finding hostels than Hostelworld and you can book the Hostel here after you find it. Especially useful is the overview about extras, facilities, etc. for instance if the offer free bedding, kitchen, wifi,... There you also can check out if they have age restriction or any other reason why you might fail to check-in even with booking via Hostelbookers. Since Hostelbookers can be very blink-blink and messy it is very important to look very closely so you won't miss that important policy.        	                2	3	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1317	            I have been using Hostelworld since 2011 and I haven't had any bad experience with the service offered by them. One of the most valuable features that Hostelworld has it is the feedback from the backpackers which are pretty accurate.I recommend this site 100% as I am still using it (I have made 15 bookings)        	                2	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1318	            I always use hostel world for all of my travels and hostel needs. The website and app are very easy to navigate to search for the perfect accommodation for all needs. It's perfect for short notice and rapid bookings. The reviews are very important and the numerical ratings great.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1319	            Useful page, easy to use and a lot or information.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1320	            Really good place to book hostels. Has a wide range of hostels for most places and has all the information you need.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	neutral
1321	            I have been using hostelworld for all my leisure trips (i travel 5-6 times a year, at least) for almost 8 years now. I only recall of having problems with the booking twice, and both were impeccably resolved with hostelworld staff within 1-2 days. It is simply a pleasure to book thru them!Their mobile app could use a revamp, though. It lacks much useful functionality you only get through the website. But I trust they will get that right eventually --better wait for a great app than rush something half baked!        	                3	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1326	            I would recommend this to anyone. I had a great stay in HI Boston. It has a perfect location, it's clean and the staff is friendly. I have had no negative experiences, it was all good and I really enjoyed my stay.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1327	            Personally, I never had problems booking via Hostelworld, I think it´s a safe option to book accomodation. To avoid problems, I would recommend to also contact the hostel directly, some days before your stay to tell them about your arrival time and/or the day before to check if everything´s ok. (Hostelworld also points out that you should reaffirm your stay 24h before your arrival.)        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1328	            Found a few hostels in China.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	neutral
1329	            I recommend Hostelworld to fellow travelers often. It is the best hostel finding and booking app out there. I only wish there were more offline features, like accessing directions to the hostels. I also wish it were possible to delete hostels from 'My Reviews' without reviewing them ( for occasions when I ended up not staying there).        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1330	            Great service, reviews always helpful.Thanks Hostelworld for organizing my trips since 2010        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1331	            You get all the details about the property and the booking is reliable.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	neutral
1332	            With Hostelworld I have never had a glitch with my bookings. It's easy to find accommodation, sort search results according to my needs, and the deposit system gives me assurance of my intended stay. No complaints.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	neutral
1333	            I stayed with Base, St Kilda. I was placed in a ten bed room and was the only female. The smell in this room was indescribable. It hit you when you entered the room and you could physically not get used to it. I complained and was told I could move to another room free of charge, but only if I provided a 5* review. I was emailed on the same day with a link, and as a penny pinching backpacker I didn't particularly feel I had a choice. The hostel already had my card details. The fact that the hostel didn't need to check the room meant it was fairly obvious that this was a common complaint. The 4 bed I was moved to was adequate. The attitude of the live in staff at this hostel equally stunk. They drank each night at the bar and the boys tried to sleep their way through the clientele. Perfectly fine but a bit repulsive, the girls could barely raise a smile, God forbid you did actually sleep with one of the boys in which case you were sure to be smirked and stared at. Everything was geared towards getting as much money as possible out of the guests. The only time something was free was on my last morning where I was told o could have breakfast for free, again for a 5* review. Not a doubt in my mind that the hostel would be rated about 2 if it wasn't for these tactics. I don't feel I can trust hostel world reviews anymore which is frustrating.        	                1	1	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1336	            I've been booking with hostel world since the mid naughties, and I love the service. The reviews from recent backpackers are what I use to rate my hostels by. I've never had a problem with booking, and arriving to the intended hostel either, and I've booked a good 50+ hostels (all over the planet) in the past 10+ years. They even helped me book a hostel in Cuba! (and Cuba isn't even supposed to have internet)        	                2	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1337	            It's the best website for cheap accommodation, simple, effective, perfect website, my only suggestion would be if Luke booking com. You can have live traffic, to see how many people are interested bin any particular place        	                3	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1340	            We were mainly only in our private room with ensuite to sleep, but the accommodation was very good. The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable and it was great having our own toilet and shower. The best thing was the location. We went to Melbourne for some activities and a conference, and everything was within a few minute's walk. My wife and I would definitely stay again.        	                3	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1343	            As a regular user of Hostelworld, I thought that their App might prove useful, and for a while it was. It provided complete record of all my Hostel bookings and the dates for each and I was convinced Inwas onto a good thing, as I could carry it with me on my iPad.But then when I went to open it obe day when I wasn't connected to the internet, there was nothing there. You are unable to use the app unless you are online, when it the downloads all your data again.This is a nuisance because, internet connections are not always available, which then renders the app practically useless, because the app does not allow you to store your data offline. So when Ingo to check the directions to a hostel I have booked, the relevant info is not there. This may not be a problem for cell phone users who have regular connectivity thru their contracts, but for others, this can be an annoying problem.        	                1	3	Saturday	hostelworld	neutral
1344	            Hostelworld is always my first go to for budget accommodation around the world.  The website is very user friendly and has the largest selection of backpackers, guest houses and budget hotels.  The price differentiation between other booking sites does indicate hostelworld has a built in commission, causing some accommodation to be higher when booked through them.  A required deposit is understandable, however other sites offer you booking without deposit - a bonus for the user.        	                1	4	Saturday	hostelworld	neutral
1345	            Easy to compare hostels side by side, and love the reviews and ratings based on other travelers experiences!        	                1	5	Friday	hostelworld	positive
1346	            On paying a $40 charge for staying 3 nights in a hostel I realised that my £10/$15 deposit was non refundable. This means hostel world are receiving over 25% of the actual cost that I paid which to me seems completely criminal. In future I will be checking websites for availability in the next area I wish to travel then going to the hostel direct or through there website to book as I don't think it is fair to be charged the same amount to stay an extra night in a hostel. So I DONT recommend this website/app whatsoever. Happy to be leaving you guys behind !!!        	                1	1	Friday	hostelworld	neutral

1349	            I booked with Hostelworld, received a confirmation email, and when I arrived at the hostel they didn't have my reservation.

The way they have the rating set up allows one to get a good grasp of the intended hostel. Some people may value different aspects of a hostel more than others and the way the site is set up, you can prioritize what you value in assessing a hostel to stay at. The anonymous reviews are also very helpful as they give a more complete view of a place.

1414	"            My girlfriend and I traveled to Sicilia in August, we visited many cities. For Agrigento, we find a hostel on Hostelworld.com, it was the first time we used this website and... It has been a very bad experience !Indeed, when we planned our stay in Agrigento on hostelworld.com, we specified that it was for 2 people but the website gave us the price for a one person without clarification. We filled the ""People"" box with ""2"" and then were offered a room for 30€/night with no more information, so we booked. At every step of the process, from online booking to the email of confirmation, we thought that we booked a room for two.But when we arrived at the hostel in Agrigento, the owner expected only one person. As we are french and he didn't speak a word of english, we couldn't communicate. We ended in an unsanitary room, with holes in the walls, stains on the sheets, a non closing window, the list goes on... and we paid twice the price given online.We hold Hostelworld.com responsible for this and don't recommend this website. Plus when asked to review our experience with hostelworld.com, we ticked the box offering ""to be contacted by the customer service of Hosterlworld.com"". We never received a call neither an email...        "	                1	1	Thursday	hostelworld	negative

My friend and I are both 17 and will turn 18 within three months, so we had some difficulty booking places to stay, which was very irritating - they're *youth* hostels!

1479	            I stayed in this hostel for 6 nights. The first thing which struck as I walked into this place to check in, was the friendliness I received from staff at reception. They are well organised. They gave me details of free daily tours available to the attractions around the city. This is a fantastic offer as this enables travellers to the city, visiting for the first time in my life an excellent facility.  I can see how this would save time with experts who take groups out to explore this unique city. As for myself I ventured out on foot just for the adventure of discovering Paris, knowing I would get lost which I did. I had an excellent work out I am sure I walked at least 6 - 9 miles a day exploring Paris. This was fun, learning to navigate through the city, figuring out to get to places becoming familiar buildings over time The hostel was clean. The rooms are kept to a high standard they are spacious and adequate for the purpose ofor short term stays. I was in one of the top floor rooms with a dorm window overlooking the city. I remember in the morning, greeted by the city view. I could see the Eiffel tower. Notredam. One very strong practical aspect of this hostel St.Christophers Inn,  was it's locality near the main Gare Du Nord train station. If travellers are flying into Charles De Gaulle Airport, all they have to do is to hop onto line 4 heading for down town Paris straight to Gare Du Nord train station. From there there it is just a mere 5 minute walk to the entrance of the hostel. How handy is that! With a lot of luggage it is ideal.The hostel had a good bar offered a free  drink on arrival which is a nice gesture. The bar staff where friendly they seced up the drinks coffee etc quick didnt have to sit long at all they were definately in the spirit of things which was good for the travellers who felt part of the whole thing bexause if that. Food was of high quality, good prices considering it is Paris. The hostel is good for folk to sit around during the evenings to chat about their day, what they seen in the city, their travels in general. Akso it wad nice to return after a full day packed with walking about. Good bar with friendly staff to welcome you back to home base, get a drink and chill fir a while to reflect on the day.They have bands there. Overall I was happy with this hostel. I have not travelled much before, mainly throughout the UK. This is different. It is challenging which makes the whole experience valuable due to a sense of the amount of walking involved but sure walking us hood for you. I hill walk and hike anyway. Makes the experience so much worth it. It was more like an adventure than a holiday.  I recommend St.Christopher's Christopher's. They have free breakfasts every morning which is a good way to start the day,saves you a few quid. Good location for access to metro rail. Took a couple of goes to get in the swing of the metro but doesn't take long at all to get confident with the system. In all my travels so far I have never seen anything like this city beautifil! The Architectre I seen walking down every street was astounding so detailed classical and majestic. It was another world I explored over the 6 days I was there. The louvre buildings are magnificent. The dancing along the river with dufferent styles and sounds of music people,playing chess, having pic nics in the middle of a city was very upset lifting and impressive. Great sense if freedom here. I loved this Paris I will return again to a city I fell in love with. The atmosphere the hussel and bussel of the cafe's and the beautiful cobbled streets, cobbled squares surrounded by cafes quaint pubs and restraunts, give a person exploring this city a real sense of inspiration  not only for the city but also personally with a positive perspective with life, and the world we live in. I liked the tree lined streets the, areas the grandure. I will miss Paris. Thank you France for this wonderful experience I will never forget.        	                1	5	Sunday	hostelworld	positive
1480	            I love hostelworld! It is the best way to find hostels to stay at while you are traveling!

1490	            I loved the Hostelworld app as it is so friendly and easy to use. It has all the information I need and for looking hostels is also good as they provide good pics and the ratings are so helpful along the comments. It will be better if you had the option to make the full payment through the app as well so you have sorted out before going to the hostels.        	                1	4	Wednesday	hostelworld	positive

1496	            I would recommend Hostelworld because it is easy to book accomodation even if you are in a hurry (the same day). No need to pay in advance.

1497	            hostelworld only wanna refund Standard Flexible Booking to account instead of cash/credit card credit, which i strongly disagree with it.

1504	            I've used hostelworld when travelling for quite a while now and had few problems so I was annoyed to spend the best part of a day to travel to a hostel to be told they hadn't received the booking for us.

1566	            Iv booked with hostel world 4 times now, my first 3 bookings were fantastic, they did exactly what I expected of them. However on my 4th booking when the hostel did not have our reservation, hostel world were incredibly unhelpful. First of all putting the blame on the hostel when we provided evidence of te hostel stating they had no rooms for us to hostel world, the company then decided to put the blame on myself claiming that they had notified me that the booking was not successful.I have since found evidence against this claim and I am now trying to contact them to get back compensation to cover the deposit paid and the increase in price and the only avaliable accommodation in the area was more expensive.

1570	            The site is user friendly and has great listings. Would be great if all bookings were already flexible and you didn't have to pay that extra fee (which isn't really that much anyway), but yeah, I can't really complain.

1574	            Haven't been misled yet but make sure you read all of the reviews for any hostel you are thinking of staying at because some appear much better than they are. You don't wanna make the mistake of staying at a place to have it turn out to be a nightmare. And remember: cheapest isn't always best.        	                1	5	Friday	hostelworld	neutral
1575	            Hostel Sant Jordi itself was beautiful, clean, the staff very kind and in general very helpful. But unless you are the type to sleep during the day and party all night; this is not the hostel for you, specially if your stay is longer than a couple of nights! This fact was not evident from the Hostelworld ratings and reviews, which shows that their reviews and rating system leaves room for improvement.        	                1	3	Friday	hostelworld	positive

1577	            Thanks for making booking hostels as easy as it could be. Everything is straight forward and easy for booking, only improvement I would suggest (don't know if you have it on the app and I'm being thick) is sorting by amenities as a drop down option - such as wifi, parking and so on.        	                1	5	Friday	hostelworld	positive

1602	            Lovely host and guys that work there, it's 24 hours and they are very helpful and you feel very safe when you are there. It's about a 7 minute walk from the nearest tube and only a few minutes from a small supermarket, 15 - 20 minute walk from the main train station, so location is very good. The 310 bus also stops right outside which goes to and from the main station. The beds were creaky which kept us up for most of the night and meant we didn't have great sleeps! The air con was broken but worked on one setting! They have a kitchen, but it wasn't as equipped as we would have hoped for because there wasn't any hot water to wash the dishes and nor any washing up liquid! There was a stove, but no oven.        	                2	4	Thursday	hostelworld	positive

1611	            I booked two nights at the Old Mill Forge which was listed as being a five-minute walk from the train station at Gretna Green. It was actually more than 3-miles along a major Motorway. It was too great a distance to walk at night with luggage. I spoke with the hotel and they advised me to cancel which I ultimately did.However it took 4 days and at least 6 emails to accomplish that. For the first 3 days, I received absolutely no response from Hostelworld, then I got an email saying that my request had been received and would be dealt with. Finally, I had to get the manager of the hotel, Graham Smith, to call Hostelworld directly and cancel the booking for me.I requested a refund of my deposit since I had booked based on misleading information. Hostelworld refused to refund the deposit. I have notified my credit card company that I will not pay that charge and I probably will never use Hostelworld again.        	                3	2	Thursday	hostelworld	neutral

1630	"            I was booking a hostel in Europe. Its description was clearly saying ""You can check-in at any time"" and ""email us to arrange your late registration"". I completed registration on Hostelworld.com and sent email to hostel to arrange my check-in time at 5pm. They replied within few hours that they only can check-in till 3pm?! Their description also said that their check-in starts at 1pm. LoL!Basically, I requested cancellation within few hours and explained the reason - ""incorrect hostel description"". Hostelworld.com didn't return their registration fee. Bad business practice - doing false advertisement (incorrect hostel description on their site) and failing to handle such typical customer support scenario.Stay away!

1656	            I love hostelworld because when I'm looking for somewhere to stay, I'm usually looking for very specific things about each city, stay, and budget, and those specifics are often different for every booking;  Hostelworld makes it easy to find and filter places to get exactly what I'm looking for for the right price.  The ratings are accurate while some reviews need to be taken with appropriate salt. I haven't had any issues where I needed to contact customer service, but that's just as good of a sign as good customer service itself!        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1660	            I loved my stay on Guernsey. The hostel I stayed at was very clean and the breakfasts were great. I would recommend this hostel to anyone, as it is quite affordable and easy to get to from the ferry terminal.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1661	            Hostelworld made it easy to find a place to stay and the map view was especially helpful. I did have to contact the hotel directly for clarification on check out times because the Hostelworld email contradicted the website, but overall no lasting problems.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	negative
1662	"            Hostelworld is a great way to find hostels, no doubt. BUT it suffers a little bit in a few places. One, the redesign made it more difficult to use. Compare is no longer obvious in its use and its a little more difficult to navigate and see the things I want to see quickly. Tweaks have been made, but more are needed. Two, the cancellation policy is a joke. You always have to make a downpayment. If you cancel you lose it. However, if you opt to pay a dollar or so fee for cancellation protection, you can get the deposit back BUT NOT THE FEE. What's the point then? Seems greedy. Beyond this, customer service IS good and when I have had issues with hostel, though they must deal with a little ""he said, she said"" they usually come to a fair conclusion, usually a credit to my account (because the hostel didn't meet all the things to proclaim to have for example). All in all, I plan to continue to use HW, but I do look elsewhere now, such as Booking.com, because they have bette rates and deals and free cancellation in many cases.

1725	            I am traveling solo in Croatia and on Monday I failed to get off a bus in Zadar, where I was to stay for 3 days, and ended up 2 1/2 hours later in Split Croatia at about 11 pm.  Needless to say as a female traveling solo for the first time in Croatia, and really hosteling for my first time as well with this month of travels, I was in a bit of a panic.  But with the Hostel world app I was able to book a new place right there on the spot in Split, easily walk there and check right in. What a relief!

But some of the discriptions are a bit vague as to how much of a party place a location is. Criptic, to me anyway. I would like a more upfront and informative discription in this area. Otherwise I have never had an issue. And even at the party locations, I have never had a problem. Traveling is great!        	                1	4	Wednesday	hostelworld	positive

1730	            Once i was a huge fan of Hostelworld. It had a fine selection of warm and welcoming Hostels and a nice service.The Hostel Selection is still good (if there's a listing - most of the time the places looked suited me more than agoda, tripadvisor or booking.com) but the Service got some issues...With the new app (iPhone 5S) it really hard to find HW good.It always crashes. It's lame - i need to wait ages for clicked sites or searchlistigs.If you want to travel with a little kid, you can not say that to the host while booking... I always need to inform them seperatly.Some times the price difference to agoda.com is huge (30 USD in Thailand)  - maybe just because agoda made a special deal...Sometimes i'm looking for 3 people in a dorm and i only can select 2 beds...Well. I hope you guys fix those bugs in the app and maybe ad a family plan to your bookings - backpackers grow older now and then....        	                1	2	Wednesday	hostelworld	positive

1742	"            Don't use hostelworld. They booked us the wrong room and the hostel we stayed at says this happens a lot for people booking through hostel world. I emailed hostel world multiple times and they did nothing to fix it. At this point it's been two weeks since I booked and I just received my third email from their customer service department saying ""they're looking into"". My recommendation use the website for quotes and reviews but book directly through the hostel.        "	                1	1	Tuesday	hostelworld	neutral
1743	            Hostelworld has the most reviews and pictures of any hostel sight. A must use for backpackers. Only gripe is the reviews of hostels seem a little bit inflated, not sure why. Just have to adjust your scale.        	                2	5	Tuesday	hostelworld	neutral

Inside of a ""closet"" and a small window that looked through the ""real"" room haha. Atmosphere was ok, some people just come to sleep with no talk and some others are more friendly.

I love that people feel comfortable to write honest reviews that don't get hidden on HostelWorld, it's daunting to find a place to call 'home' while you are travelling and I think reviews are the best way to get a feel for a place before you book.        	                1	5	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive

1757	            I am probably in the too percentile of Hostelworld users, having booked hundreds of hostels through them as a very frequent traveller. My concern comes from the fact that on more than one occasion they have edited or not posted my review when it has been critical of a property. For a site that prides itself on being loyal to customers and posting real reviews, this shows that their true interests are in money from hostels. I no longer use the site when I can help it, and would not recommend it to anyone who can find an alternative.        	                1	2	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive

1763	            I stayed in hostels during my recent trip thru Europe. I'm single, over 50, female traveling alone and I had a great experience. This sight is the best because you can find a place to stay anyplace you want to go with a. App on your phone. Hosteling for me was better than hotels because I met people and it was inexpensive. Most people in hostels were in their 20s but not all, and everyone was opening and friendly. The site helped me to know exactly what type of place I was getting into before I got there. I'm a hotel world devotee.        	                1	5	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive

1779	            Most of the time it's been worked out and the hostels have been great! However, on one occasion the hostel didn't receive confirmation from Hostelworld of our booking even though I had receipts from Hostelworld. Apparently this has happened to other people. Sometimes it's best to look at reviews on Hostelworld and book through the hostel site itself if possible. Hostelworld took no responsibility and made me figure everything out with the hostel. Regardless of who lost the reservation, they need to step up and claim responsibility.        	                1	3	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive

1807	            Hostel world is a great site for one reason only, they offer a complete list of hostels in the area you are looking for with pictures and reviews.  Booking through Hostel World is a total rip off, the deposit you pay doesn't go towards the balance of the actual accommodation it is their fee aka profit.  So based on where you stay and for however long hostel world is getting their portion for each day based on the hostels rate for that room...total joke.  They should get a small reasonable commission for each booking not a base percentage of every different place.  Their profits are all over the place and it's taking advantage of the customer.        	                1	3	Wednesday	hostelworld	positive

1809	            While I was travelling in Europe, I had booked most of accommodations with Hostelworld. However, when I arrived in London, the accommodation has shut down. I was shocked this situation so I called the owner of hostel. He said Hostelworld had sent me an email. Unfortunately, my phone was broken while I was travelling so I couldn't check my email before. When I checked my email, they just sent me 2days ago before my arrival time. They shouldn't expect that everyone can check their email all the time. It was a nightmare because I knocked five hostel doors to find a bed. It was a peak season so those were full at that time. Also, I needed to pay three times higher than the original place where I booked with Hostelworld. Hostelworld hasn't taken care of this situation at all. The main issue is they haven't refunded my booking fee yet although I have asked it to them three times. I am still waiting for their response to receive it. It's really unpleasant and I am not happy for this with Hostelworld. Dear Hostelworld, could you please look into my issue?        	                1	3	Wednesday	hostelworld	negative
1810	            I purchased a number of accommodations through hostel world for my trip to South America  and had a problem with one hostel overcharging me even tho the price was agreed. It took hostel world several emails to step in , if you can even call that- they simply emailed the hostel once.  In the end I had to sort it out myself -  the hostel world did absolutely nothing and ignored my emails. Definitely not worth paying them 17% in fees for that service!

1825	            Hostelworld is my go-to whenever I need a reliable, cheap hostel to stay in. I've booked months in advance, and sometimes with only an hour or so notice and I have never had an issue.

1827	            I hope this review changes your thoughts that Hostels are dormitories where you are in with a crowd and communal showers. Ours was quite private, spotless, excellent food where we were and the service exceeded some of the hotel chains where we stayed on this trip! My husband and I were there with our 18 year old son - he had reservations - he loved it! It was a quick walk to the National Park, The staff helped us with great suggestions and the coffee was the best ever! I wish we could have stayed longer. I will be using Hostelworld again!        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1837	            Great place to find places to stay. The reviews are very helpful on where to go and where not to go. I would plan on going to a city because of a hostel. It's a very good website        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1838	"            I recently booked four separate locations with Hostel World as my cousin and I road tripped around Ireland.  Some were better than others, and I would definitely caution you to thoroughly read reviews of each location you're visiting, though the individual hostels themselves are not what I'm reviewing here.  I've reviewed those on Hostel World as well as on Trip Advisor.I say read the fine print, because when you book with Hostel World, each place you book will require a deposit, and then they offer a 3.00 US deposit protection fee -- so that in the event that you have to cancel, if you do so within 24 hours, you'll get your deposit back (usually 10-15 USD depending on the property).  There's fine print listed with it, but it's hidden in the ""see more"" button, which I only ever click if I haven't understood something.  It even says 'recommended' over top of the option.  Of course it's recommended... they want your money since you'll likely not need to cancel, but in the event that you do have to, they can sit on your money so that you can only spend it with them.  I in fact did have to cancel one, as when you're road tripping things can change.  I contacted Hostel World to get my 10.75 USD deposit back, and apparently in the fine print (which doesn't pop up when you're asked if you want to apply the protection, you have to click ""see more"" to find it) it states that ""your deposit is protected so you can use it to make another booking within the next six months if you cancel"".  If after six months you haven't used it, you can apparently email customer service and ask them to extend it.  Hopefully they can extend it every six months until I have enough money to return to Europe...Well, since I'm now home from a vacation that cost me 3000 Canadian Dollars, I can pretty much guarantee that I will not be needing to use my Hostel World account for a long time, and I sincerely wish I hadn't wasted 12 USD on deposit protections for each of the 4 properties -- because that's more money than the deposit I've now pretty much lost.  In all, I feel like I've lost 22.75 USD at this point, and that doesn't make me very happy.Read all the fine print before you book, and know that if it seems too good to be true, with Hostel World, it likely is.

1852	            The very 1st hostel in stayed in from this site in Athens, Greece bed bugs (which I had never seen before). I was bitten all over my body (face, neck, arms, back). The hostel covered it up by saying it was only mosquitoes. They didn't return my money. They moved someone else in the room the next morning I complained instead of getting a new mattress or something. The other hostels I stayed in were like the 4 Seasons in comparison during my 2 weeks trip. So, it's hard to recommend there services when I've experienced real highs and extreme lows.        	                1	3	Monday	hostelworld	neutral

All the information is easy to reach, and clearly laid out. The other thing that I really appreciate is the protection plans, they are the cheapest of any service (that provides a similar amount of hostels in the search), and is reliable. I would still go to the hostel's website to book there if possible, so they get all the money, but hostelworld is easy, quick and has all you need in one place. I used to use hostelbookers, but even though hostelworld now owns them, bookers cost more for the protection.

1905	            The staff is friendly.The place is clean. Nothing bites in the bed or in the room. There is your bare basic. The bathroom and shower stalls are clean, sparkling clean, much exceeded my expectation for a hostel; and there is hot water around the clock. The macro picture of the kitchen is clean and decent, but bring your own cookware and eating utensils if you are as meticulous as I am.Yes, I would stay there again, and again.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1906	            I prefer to communicate directly with the hostel to gather a reassuring understanding, but HostelWorld did an awesome job answering my enquiries. Thank you!        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1907	            I did not have any problems with Hostel World while making a booking as well as the time I had to make a cancellation because I did not have enough time to visit the city where I booked through Hostel world. I traveled through Europe for 70 days, I did not have my computer with me and I was able to make a review of the hostels I stayed in after I got home. With the other booking co I was not able to. I wrote a letter to them and still no reply. good service Hostel World!!!!        	                3	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1911	            I have used hostel world for a multitude of accommodations over the last 6 years.  The filters, sorting, and review capability of hostelworld make it a great way to search for the right place to stay for your trip.  I have no complaints about using hostel world.        	                2	5	Monday	hostelworld	neutral
1912	            The owner is lovely and helpful. The location is good - one easy bus to the old town. The room, however, was really dirty when we arrived - we asked for it to be cleaned and it was by the following evening but if they had been cleaning it regularly it shouldn't have been like that. The wifi doesn't reach the room which is obviously really annoying - you have to go sit outside reception to use it, this was particularly annoying because we had some terrible weather while we were there. Finally, the kitchen only has a fridge, microwave, kettle and very few utensils so its very hard to cook anything.        	                1	3	Monday	hostelworld	negative
1913	            I was very impressed with the Hostelworld site.  It made trip planning in Ireland easy, and allowed us to stay at some wonderful, reasonably priced places.  It's a well designed site and easy to use.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1914	            Excellent – no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone.        	                2	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1915	            Always read the reviews and check the terms of the hostel such as reception hours, breakfast, wifi, bed sheet and linen, etc.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	neutral
1916	            The best way to search your next hostel, it's easy to use and reliable. I use it in all my trips. Sometimes it says that the taxes are included but in the hostel they charge you the taxes, I don't know if it is a hostelworld problem.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	neutral
1917	            Hostelworld.com provides a service that no other website does. It is easy to use and reliable.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	neutral
1918	            Used this site to find the best deals on budget accommodations around the world. I use it on basically every trip I take!        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1919	            It's great for finding hostels in different cities. However it still has some kinks; my original booking changed and I wasn't informed of the changes.        	                1	3	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1920	            I book 3 hostels thru hostelworld. At the beggining it was a little hard to understand how the site works, but when you familiar with it, its very easy to use.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1921	            I traveled parts of Asia with a friend recently and utilized Hostelworld numerous times for booking rooms. Even on short notice we were able to get a good room in a convienient location.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1922	            From what I've seen, the hostels I've visited get enough of their business from hostelworld.com and similar sites, that it keeps them pushing to be better on the things they're rated on. I always book at top rated sites as well, and feel the ratings can be trusted. Besides the convenience of booking whole trips at one site, this is the value HostelWorld.com delivers -- it actually makes hostels strive to be cleaner, more updated, and locate in more convenient areas. As a result, I'll book my next trip's stays with HostelWorld!        	                3	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1923	            Does what it says on the tin, plain and simple: what more might be demand or indeed expected. The travel insurance offered seams pricey and on the one occasion I tried to claim it proved highly problematic to do so, I gave up and no longer purchase. To date Hostelworld apparently haven't sold my email address to companies dedicated to filling inboxes with crap. If they haven't broken client confidence, that is respected the privacy of customers personal contact emails addresses to third parties then that is good, but as yet an unknown.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	neutral

1925	            On a recent 1 week trip to Spain, I reserved stays at 3 different hostels via Hostelworld. The reviews were accurate, but one of the hostels sold our beds to someone else. They knew we were coming, even greeted me with 'are you Michael?'. Then told me they were overbooked. They put us up for free at a local airbnb for one night, but we were on our own for the second night. Could not find anything close though.        	                2	2	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1935	            Hostel world is great that it's cheap and quick. But for all its loyalty, it would be nice to receive some sort of payback, like a rewards system to keep me, and others, motivated to keep writing reviews        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive
1936	            The site is good, trustworthy. Just be careful when choosing which places, reviews aren't always what they seem. Some give low stars but only have one issue, such as one slightly grumpy staff member, or bad shower pressure. And works other way around too.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	negative

1939	            I just did a tour of Europe and using hostelworld allowed us to feel safe and in control of our trip. We could change our stay at any time and have a great selection of hostels to choose from. However, I do think hostelworld can add many more hostels. For instance, there is only one camping hostel listed for Switzerland and there are tons of them, even within walking distance of the one already listed on hostelworld.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1958	            I booked two hostals through Hostalworld.com and both choices were great. Hostalworld is a very friendly site  that provides  lots of choices  with a big range of accommodations and fees. They have an efficient and fast communication. They provided me with  an excellent information about the Hostal that was very helpful  for me . I was able to talk to the people at every Hostal, and to know every location ahead of time .        	                1	5	Wednesday	hostelworld	positive
1959	            The information on location and the reviews are great but would actually only rate as 3.5* the pricing system can be misleading and you can't edit the reviews once they're posted. A couple of times I've reviewed the wrong place by accident and can't go back to change it. I sometimes don't book through HW and can't then review through the site which is also a downside, though I guess it's to prevent people from being dishonest which is fair enough. I like that you can see how many times others have reviewed properties as it helps to get more honest opinions. I think that the scoring system should be out of 10 not 5 as often it scores the properties higher than I would rate them as there isn't a great enough scope on a 1-5 basis.        	                1	4	Wednesday	hostelworld	positive
1960	            Hostel World is awesome for identifying and evaluating hostels around the world.

1961	            Second time staying in this hostel. The guy who checked us in, vinny, was cool. Great atmosphere and the best facilities I've seen in a hostel. Beds are comfortable. Another amazing thing about the hostel is the location, right on the edge of kreutzberg and freidrichstein so the best place in the city for nightlife.        	                1	5	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive

1974	            The hostel was in a beautiful location.  Staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  The hostel was very clean.  A well equipped kitchen and good eating area.  My only comment would be that there were very few toilets and showers, not really enough for the size of hostel.  However, we would definitely go back as this is the only criticism and wouldn't put us off returning.  Good location for beautiful mountain walks and a short walk to the beach.  We had a wonderful time and I would certainly recommend this hostel.        	                4	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

1999	            Hostelworld is usually the best site for booking based on it's customer reviews. Hotels and hostels always use the best pictures of their accommodations, but it doesn't always live up. When I book (and I travel a lot), I look first at overall rating, location and price, but I always look at customer reviews throughly. I read them critically looking for patterns such as multiple comments on the cleanliness or ease of getting to the city centre. I also like that it only shows places based on my preferences. It won't show me places that don't have the type of room I need. I would like to see hostelworld grow as it doesn't have many options in some cities in Asia. For example, I struggled to find accommodation on Phi Phi Island in Thailand.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive

2002	            Easiest way of booking when on the go. The app is great, easy to use and keeps track of all bookings in one place. Only downside is cannot see bookings while offline. Low booking fees and trustworthy reviews left by others makes choosing a place to stay easy.

2031	            Overall I had a pretty good experience with Hostelworld.com. The only caveat for me was that it was challenging to adjust a reservation through them - in order to change the dates on a reservation, I had to completely cancel and then rebook. Also, in order to contact a hostel to ask questions, etc., I had to send a completely separate personal email to the actual hostel hosts (couldn't communicate with them through Hostelworld.) But other than that, the ability to book hostels across Europe through one site has been pretty convenient!        	                1	4	Sunday	hostelworld	positive

2038	            I like hostelworld, because it offers a wide range of different hostels and gives all the information needed for any traveller. the only thing missing is information about difficult access for example, for handicapped people.

2042	            Hostel world offers a big range of Hostels and Guest Houses all over Thailand. Even in cities and on islands which are not that touristic you can find something which fits your needs. The variety of offers gives you the possibility to find something for every style and budget. The ratings are mostly helpful even though sometimes one should consider that you get what you paid for. Meaning for a really low price you can't expect five star facilities!        	                1	4	Wednesday	hostelworld	neutral
2043	            It's very easy to use the site, and they probably have some of the best deals. I trust the reviews, and its' pretty easy to tell whether or not a hostel will be good.        	                1	5	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive
2044	            I use Hosteworld for a majority of my bookings but I prefer the web design &amp; functionality of HostelbookersThe PC web app does not show the full month of check in dates. It is partly hidden at bottom of screen. Whereas another booking site pops the check in date window onto to the visible part of the screen.It would also be nice to explore hostels or destinations without a definite check in &amp; check out date. As a traveler, often you have not decided exactly when you will go somewhere so you just want to look at hostel info, prices, directions etc and firm up the dates later.        	                1	4	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive
2045	            The bookings were no hassle in all 9 hostels everyone was expecting us. The only bit of criticism i have that when you print off your booking confirmation it would be great if you had a clear full address with directions how to get to the hostel with the hostels direct phone number with a street map i had some trouble finding some hostels but this is a great service but would be brilliant with the things i mentioned keep up the good work        	                8	5	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive

2050	            Not only is the website user friendly, it's incredibly easy to find a place to stay on hostelworld.com. With a few clicks on the filters (for ratings, room type, etc.), you instantly have options to choose from with a map of the location and some photos of the property. The app is modern and functional and was a life saver when I booked hostels on the go in Thailand. It's one of the few travel sites I can genuinely trust for reviews as only travelers who have actually stayed there are permitted to submit a review.  For almost every trip I take, hostelworld.com is my starting point because of the varied inventory of places to stay and ease of booking a hostel.        	                1	5	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive
2051	            Searching for accommodation in London, I browsed many, many, many different booking websites searching for the cheapest hostel. Hostelworld is very similar in design and search functions to multiple other booking websites, but it did have the hostel I eventually used listed on it, so it probably has more places listed - or maybe just different ones. ANyway, it's fine, I had no problems with it.        	                1	4	Tuesday	hostelworld	negative

2053	            Quite honestly, I have only positive aspects to report on hostelworld.com.

2061	            Tip: use hostelworld to find a hostel and then book direct with them or on another site. Rant: Hostelworld is crap because you have to pay a non-refundable deposit. Booking.com has no deposits and often free cancellation. It's awful that hostelworld doesn't refund ANYTHING. I made a booking where I accidentally opted for flexible booking, costing £7. I realised 2 hours later and asked hostelworld for this money back. They say no. I also notice that the exchange rate they used on my deposit is much worse than the google exchange rate meaning I lose another £2.80 this way. I ask hostelworld why and they say because they use a fixed rate. They do not offer my money back for this even though their rate is 8% higher than the google one. So I'm down £9.80 because of their 'sorry no refunds heh' policy. Never again!        	                1	2	Monday	hostelworld	negative

2070	            I've had nothing but success booking with hostel world. I used them extensively both in Western Europe and Southeast Asia.

2074	            Since I'm traveling around the world (and it's been a long time) it's been my favourite site to book backpacker style hostels.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	neutral
2075	            Has a large number of listings, misses out a few. Prices are different from the actual hostels, prices differ between search page and when you click on a hostel, the app is terrible and doesn't respond.        	                3	3	Monday	hostelworld	negative
2076	            I enjoyed my bookings on hostel.com. Payments were fine, mediocre customer support (but really friendly people), nice layout of the website. However, do not trust the review system: some reviews are done by foolish people that don't know what's good and what's not  ;)        	                2	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive
2077	            This is a great site to find the hostels all over the world for all budgets. Reasonable booking fees. Can be paid in multiple currencies.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

2079	            HW let's me find the best hostels everywhere I go. Always getting good recommendations from other users and I can do it on my phone too. Just Great.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

2081	            You must pay a deposit when booking. I put in my bank details being told I would be charged $10.44, instead I was charged $11.48. Though this is minimal, it is unaccepable for this to happen. I had to email customer service 4 times before they realised their mistake, afterwhich they offered to return me only $0.70, of which NEVER happened. They are crooks. I wouldn't be surprised if they were purposefully overcharging people in hopes that no one will notice.        	                1	1	Monday	hostelworld	negative

2083	            Found decently priced places on Hostelworld where the ratings matched the places reviewed. Out of the 20 plus bookings, only had one glitch where the site keep putting in the wrong dates for my booking, otherwise, it has worked very smoothly. Liked the way that clear travel instructions for various transport options were given in getting to the hostel.        	                1	4	Monday	hostelworld	neutral
2084	            My journey through the website rather smooth. Interface is clean and intuitive, all information appropriately placed. Payment ok. I have only concern: when you send request for property review it automatically fills it as anonymous and then when I sign in, I can't go back and edit it if needed. It also seem not to display the entire review. 2. Password reminder - I find the password complexity check is too complex, i.e. having %$^ and number. But in general -  nice website with lots of valuable information! Well done!        	                3	4	Monday	hostelworld	positive

2100	            people we have been able to find rooms in hostile world for every City that we wanted to visit. We wanted to work with local people and they were able to bring us closer to the local citizens visited. We were very happy with their security, their prices, and their accommodations. They obviously work with the local people and keep up their expertise and the ratings.  We feel that we will benefit from using hostelworld for the rest of our trip  in Europe.        	                1	5	Monday	hostelworld	positive

2109	            I really enjoyed using Hostel World to book some time away. I was able to find a great place to stay internationally that was way less than what I typically spend to get out of town.

2115	            Easy way to book a hostel worldwide especially when there's no time for having a look around. We booked a very nice hostel for one night in Bangkok.

2118	            It had all been wonderful with Hostel World: so easy to use, you can select th4e exact characteristics you want in a hostel and review ratings/sort by ratings... very easy to work with as well, and the cancellation protection offer for under 2$ was great: it allows you to you cancel the bookings without losing your deposit up to 24 hours before check in.But one time I selected the Oasis hostel in Granada, which had over a 86% rating &amp; great reviews, and ended up in a disgusting, dirty dump that was clearly not maintained or ever swept. So I wrote a review describing how dirty the place was on Hostel World (I was comparing it to 7 other hostels I had stayed at, and all were acceptable), only to realize my comments and review was removed from the webpage a few days later... I guess now I know why the hostel had good ratings despite being a dump. Needless to say, I don't trust Hostel World ratings anymore and will consider my options of booking and ratings review websites (maybe try trip adviser) before my next backpacking trip.        	                1	3	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive

2124	            Do not get fooled by the offer of refund in case of cancellation. You will not get one. Instead they give a credit which can only be used for future bookings. I have been ripped off thinking that I would get a refund if I paid extra for their so called refund guarantee. When you pay they get you. Never will you get your money back, only a credit, which if you never book through them they keep. Slick ripoff scream.        	                1	1	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive

2128	            It's great to have everything in one place so you safe time looking for a place to stay at. Not all we booked were great but that's on us. We chose location above everything else and didn't follow rates from others which is a good thing to do, if you care about it.Using Hostel world was the best way for us traveling from Denmark to Milan in 18 days staying at hostels most of the time.

2129	            Hostelworld is great, easy to use, it has rather reliable reviews, and constant follow up. I started using it years back, and I plan to keep this good habit of mine - hw.com is one of the best friends of a backpacker. :)        	                1	5	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive

2133	            Hostelworld.com is the best way to choose your hostel. Hostels are NOT hotels. So, there is no reason to book a hostel room or dorm from any other site. The best reviews, pricing, and contact information is on Hostelworld.com. I like the fact that I can pay a deposit for my bed, the webpage is easy to use, and I know that even if my flight arrives at an odd hour, I will have a place to put my bag.        	                1	5	Tuesday	hostelworld	positive
2134	            My story. I booked a hotel room , paid a deposit , received confirmation , but at next day hostelworld canceled my reservation. I booked a room at another hotel , again received confirmation - but when I arrived at the hotel , I was in for a surprise . It was the worst accommodation in my life . when I arrived at the hotel I was told that my reservation is canceled , and instead of my delux room I was staying in a room with no windows , no shower , no toilet and no ventilation . on top of that I was told that my deposit that I paid online I will refund by hostelworld , and I paid full price. hostelworld did not return to me my deposit , so I paid twice. NEVER use this service if you want to save your money and do not want to be cheated!and of course that guarantee , of which they write on the site - is a fraud . no guarantee other than the guarantee problems and loss of money .        	                1	1	Monday	hostelworld	negative
