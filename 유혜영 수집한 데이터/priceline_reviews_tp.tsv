0	            Priceline made everything so easy and convenient.  I used Express deals for a 4 star hotel and they put us in an amazing hotel at a great price! I will never use another website. Priceline is ideal!        	                1	5	Tuesday	priceline	positive

13	            The staff was great. Hotal not so much. It's a business hotel. Not for children. It would have been perfect for a solo or couples trip. Leave the kids at home if you are staying here.        	                1	3	Monday	priceline	positive
14	            The price higher for Dubai compare to other website, and bidding doesn't give u good saving, u can go directly to competitor website and get good offer.

25	            I have used the site to find specific hotels, and also to find the best available hotel in a given area. In each case I have been pleased with the quality of the hotels for the prices I found on Priceline.

27	            Booking the room online was easy however when I got there I was placed in a second floor room and I’m disabled and have to walk switch cane, the bed was new however the bottom sheet had cigarette burns in it and the toilet ran all night. I tried to giggle the handle but at 6am I just shut the water to the toilet off. I talked to Jamaica about my issues and she didn’t offer to do anything to make up for all the problems I had.        	                2	1	Sunday	priceline	neutral

30	            One thing that hurts me about Priceline  is no refund policy which basically if for any reason you want to modify your hotel book,  cancel,  you are screwed.        	                1	3	Sunday	priceline	negative
31	            I am a frequent flyer and use many different sites to book tickets and priceline is by far the absolute worst. I booked a ticket and typed an (a) in place of the (e). I realized that as soon as i received my confirmation and called in to correct it. I was told there would be a 100$ charge to correct the spelling. The agent then told me well if you dont want to pay then cancel your flight. I have never been met with such horrible customer service and i will NEVER book through priceline again, and I will make sure every internet site and social media account attached to them knows not to book with them either. Completely disgusted.        	                1	1	Sunday	priceline	negative
32	"            The worst  experience with priceline! We booked family vacation , flight and hotel in Cancun Mexico with priceline. When we arrived in the  hotel The Ritz Carlton, with two little kids , we were told that there is no reservation for us, it was 4 pm , and we were enough tired   and exsausted  from the trip.That was a big  shock for us,we were so excited for the vacation and priceline ruined it! at all! Hotel stuff,were very surprised how they were not able  to find our reservation  from priceilne, we gave them printed copy with the  confirmation numbers .We start calling priceline, 3 hours spent through voicemails and transfers from one to another person , finally we reached a live person , and another shock,   after explaining to priceline representative that we are waiting in the hotel with hours, (with kids that are crying, because of the situation) ,she said ""sorry we forgot to reserve the room for you""OMG I can not believe what she said! And she can not do anything now, only  if she can  ""try"" to find another hotel for us if is possible nearby! Hotel stuff offered us to book a room  directly with them,  with double price that we already paid to priceline! We did not have an choice, cause was already late night time.We  paid  the hotel one more time with double price , because priceline forgot to  make hotel reservation fr us! So much bad experience!, never again using them!        "	                1	1	Sunday	priceline	negative
33	            Very happy with my Priceline experience. Only complaint was my own fault. Would have liked to spend more time there, but when I got my final airline schedule my time was the first flight out at 6:15 a.m., would have more appreciated a flight time after hotel checkout times. I still saved hundreds of dollars! ;).        	                1	4	Saturday	priceline	positive

38	            We were told by the front desk that they don’t have our reservation. Luckily I have the confirmation email from Priceline with me but it still took them more than 15 minutes to straighten everything out. At the end, the hotel is nice enough to upgrade our room.        	                1	4	Saturday	priceline	positive

Deal not available, and my credit card authorized again!!Customer service offered no help at all.

94	            Problems with booking last week, Monday Nov 19th in DuBois PA. You said rooms and rates were available but when I tried to book, the site acted like it was going to book and then, Poof, Sorry room not available at this rate. But guess what? Chase Visa charged me for that room. I'm going to see if it's taken off by now but thankfully my trips on Priceline says I had a failed booking so that's where I'm starting. Also this week when we booked a hotel in Youngstown OH on the way home, Wed Nov 28th, when we got to the hotel the front desk man had a problem with your credit card payment and was on hold for 20 minutes to get to one of your customer service people to help him. Not acceptable.        	                1	3	Monday	priceline	neutral

97	            I have doing a great deal of traveling lately and Priceline has never disappointed me! I’ve been staying in great hotels for resonable prices. Priceline has been my first resource when finding reliable reviews and the best place to stay!        	                2	5	Monday	priceline	positive

99	            We have the utmost trust in Priceline.  In researching for hotels in any area, the selection is awesome.  We usually use the Express Deal feature and have always been pleased with the hotel and the prices received.  Our last purchase has been far and above our expectations, and one that we never would have even looked into (figuring it was out of our range)!  Thank You!!!        	                3	5	Sunday	priceline	positive

101	            WARNING** DO NOT USE PRICELINE TO BOOK HOTELS, CARS, or FLIGHTS. Terrible customer service, inaccurate reservations, and extra fees when you actually fulfill the booking. I booked a room in a hotel with a hot tub, two beds, a view, and no extra fees. Besides the correct dates, priceline got everything else wrong and took zero responsibility for it to help afterwards. The room I got was a king bed, no view, the hotel had no hot tub, and the hotel added over $100 of fees.        	                1	1	Sunday	priceline	negative
102	            Nice, clean room.  Very quite.  'Grab and go' breakfast was perfect for me.  Staff was very accommodating.  Only complaint was trashy parking lot and limited parking near the main entrance.  Nothing can be done to increase the size of the front lot, but something could be done about the trash.  This room and hotel was everything it was advertised to be.  No, it doesn't have daily linen service, it's an extended stay hotel with weekly service.  Internet was sufficient for everything I needed to do but higher speeds were available for a small fee. Need anything else, walk to the front desk and ask!        	                2	4	Sunday	priceline	neutral

107	            Priceline deals with fraudulent companies. If you don't believe me, just google Executive Car Rentals and you will see for yourself. A company is not trustworthy if they deal with con artists.        	                1	1	Sunday	priceline	negative

111	            Priceline sold me a ticket from US to Portugal but the layover at the NY airport was not long enough to make it to the next plane. (only 51 minutes) They also did not warn me I needed a round trip per/Portugal law. That forced me to buy another one way at twice the price I would have paid for one round trip. They refused to reimburse me the $400 the airline charged me to change the ticket. They refused to talk to me because I had called the airline to discover the problems. So they ruined my trip, forced me to pay more for a ticket and fees. They took no responsibility. Did not offer a credit or an apology. Any tickets purchased from then with connecting flights need to be scrutinized carefully.        	                2	1	Sunday	priceline	negative

120	            I would have given a 5 rating but my last experience was horrible. I booked a hotel for an upcoming trip but I made a mistake of putting the wrong date. I immediately noticed it and called Priceline Customer service right away and informed that I already paid for the hotel but made a mistake of putting wrong date and need to correct the date. I have been a Priceline customer since 09 and I was disappointed with the poor customer service I received from Customer Service staff. Although the upcoming trip is not until next week, the Customer Service staff did not even attempt to changed the date or call the hotel. I had paid for the room already for this upcoming trip. I did not want to cancel but to change the date since I made the mistake of putting the wrong date. Very disappointed with Priceline esp I have been a customer since 09.        	                1	3	Saturday	priceline	negative

132	            I use Priceline just about every day and overall it's not a bad site. Bad thing is you can't collect hotel points, no free nights after so many stays. Sometimes your better off going to the hotel chains main site,  paying a few dollars more and collecting those points.        	                1	3	Friday	priceline	positive

137	            I have never experienced such rude and racial behavior.  I've stayed at Hawthorne Suite in Hilliard Ohio several times but Rebecca at the front desk accused my teenage daughter of being a known prostitute.  Then she called the police and told them we refused to leave - she never asked us to leave.  She also said my husband threatened her - in front of the police! He never did anything to her.  Even the officers said it was a racial thing.  We booked for 4 people for one week and left the second day.  It was Thanksgiving week and also my daughters birthday.  Now we were left 2000 miles from home with no available hotel options.  I called corporate and almost 2 weeks later, I'm still waiting for a response.  Luckily Ryan at Hilton in Dublin hooked us up with a 2 bedroom suite for cheaper than the Hawthorne.  I will NEVER use racist Hawthorn EVER!  And to top it off, there was chunks of dirt on the couch and black mold in the shower.        	                1	1	Friday	priceline	negative

146	            Generally gets better pricing than other sites. However you now have to use the mobile site to get name your own price, and the booking fee sometimes makes the room more expensive than just booking through the hotel  site.

174	            PricelineI use your service daily, and have been overall pleased. But I have had two encounters now with your deals showing online and not being able to book my room. Associates telling me that the can get me a room for more money than what is advertised. They tie up my money to get a room elsewhere and I don't understand how my money is tied up if I'm not charged for a room. Finally I was given the price that the hotel charges and told I could pay the cost of the room to the hotel upon departure but was told by the hotel that if I didn't pay right then I had to leave. I understand the hotel but I am very upset with Priceline and may not deal with you again. You cost me $45 more dollars today than I should not have had to pay and booking me the room thru the hotel I was already staying at I could have done myself.        	                1	3	Wednesday	priceline	negative

187	            Priceline is my go-to for hotel bookings. The name your price option has allowed us to stay in hotels we otherwise couldn’t afford! We’ve only once had a poor experience, and honestly there weren’t any nicer hotels in the area than the one we ended up in so it was just a poor destination choice on our part and didn’t have anything to do with Priceline.        	                1	5	Wednesday	priceline	neutral

197	"            I WILL NEVER BOOK WITH PRICELINE AGAIN! My boyfriend booked a flight via Kayak for a trip to Scotland this coming Mayas a surprise to me. After he booked the flight, he realized there was a letter missing from my middle name (instead of Patricia, the reservation was for Patrica; mind you, my boyfriend suffers from dyslexia). Immediately, he begins calling Priceline, the company in charge of managing the reservation. He is welcomed by staying on the phone for over 4 hours (half of which he is on hold for) with customer service speaking broken English from scripts explaining that they would have to ""start a process"" requiring 55 dollars to move forward. After paying the $55 dollar fee, he is told that he would have to make another reservation for double the money in order to add the letter to my name. He calls the airline who explains this is Priceline's policy and would have to take it up with Priceline. After hearing this, I call myself and am welcomed by someone with a thick accent blurting out finally that I would have to pay $55 dollars to get any answers Thus begins 2 hours of wasted time. After explaining my issue and my boyfriend's previous payment, she hands me off to ""Blake."" ""Blake,"" the ""supervisor of customer service at Priceline"" informs me that I will have to spend $728 (my original ticket was grossly $450 dollars) to make another reservation because one letter in my middle name is missing. When asked why, Blake explained this was the policy of the airline. So, I request to get the airline's information and/or to do a conference call with the airline (Finnair, operated by American Airlines). Blake begins rattling off 13 digit phone numbers to me (I am a U.S. citizen) and reports Priceline cannot do conference calls. When I ask if I can speak to a supervisor, Blake says she is the only supervisor and there is no one else for me to speak with to which I reply ""Can you give me a phone number or email account to contact or are you the CEO of Priceline?"" Blake answers ""there is no other phone number or email account for you to contact."" I, refusing to accept this, explain that I would like to file a complaint and would like to know how. Blake tells me to go on the website and she can no longer help me. What do I do? I call Finnair and am greeted with someone easily understandable and kind within just a few minutes. She explains that the the fee/reservation is on Priceline's end but that Finnair does not accept incorrect names on the tickets. She urges me to call Priceline back to negotiate price. My boyfriend has called back multiple times and continues to be left on hold for unimaginable amounts of time with people speaking almost unintelligible English who are all apparently the CEOs of Priceline and cannot allow him to speak with/contact any supervisor. I just spent 30 min on Priceline's online website unable to find a location for filing a complaint. I attempted the chatbox which told me to call ""Priceline's excellent customer service network."" Priceline is an outrageous scam of hidden fees and outsourced customer service unable to provide answers or accommodations for honest, hardworking customers. My boyfriend wanted to surprise me with a trip to one of my bucket list destinations. Now, after spending nearly $1000 for the flights, we are faced with another $728 dollar fee. I, a frequent flyer, will not be purchasing flights through Priceline again if this complaint is not heard.        "	                1	1	Wednesday	priceline	neutral

216	            I have used Priceline for many years.  I always get what I feel is a good price for hotel rooms and rental cars.  The only improvement I would like to see is the ability to get a room with 2 beds (my kids are young) on the Name Your Own Price (or Express deals without having to pay more.)  You are only guaranteed a room for two adults with the Name Your Own Price.  I found this out the hard way when we showed up at a full hotel, got a room with only one bed and there were three of us and was told we were only guaranteed a single room.  I had to sleep in the window seat!  Not the best experience!        	                1	4	Tuesday	priceline	positive

226	            We have used Priceline many times and gotten great hotels.  Only twice have we been disappointed.  In Thousand Oaks, CA, the hotel we got was awful and nowhere near the star rating.  In Diamond Bar, CA, we were in a hotel that reeked of cigarette smoke, had a non-working sink in our room, and were treated incredibly rudely by the front desk staff.  I am sorry to report that they were Asian.  The hotel catered to traveling Asians who tend to smoke a lot and they allowed them to smoke on certain floors but the entire hotel reeked of tobacco.  It was sickening.  We couldn’ wait to get out of there.  I registered a complaint with Priceline and got NOTHING  in both cases.  When something like that happens, I think Priceline has an obligation to make things right.  In both cases, given that Priceline makes millions, they should have refunded our money.        	                2	5	Monday	priceline	negative

259	            What an absolute disaster booking with Priceline turned out to be. The deal with Priceline was slightly higher than another booking website – the reason I booked is that it stated (in three different places) that free breakfast was included. Arrived at the hotel and they asked me how I would like to pay for my stay (which I had already done). They had no payment details, only my name, and hotel staff and myself spent nearly two hours getting in touch with Priceline and then Agoda, who Priceline explained was a 'sister company' who they had purchased the deal from to save money - though there is no mention of Agoda on my itinerary and confirmation. Priceline refused to help and gave me a US number - I'm in the UK. Every time I called Agoda, they said 'your booking is confirmed' after I entered the reservation number and then hung up on me. Travelodge explained that my booking had the hallmarks of a fraudulent booking. I eventually had to pay all over again (Travelodge's fee was 50 pounds less than what I had paid to Priceline) to access the room I had already paid for. Travelodge eventually refunded the money later that night because they suspected they could chase up the missing payment. To top it off, the 'free breakfast' magically disappeared when Priceline bought the 'room only' deal from Agoda. Their incompetence and dishonesty cost me two hours standing in a hotel lobby and breakfast for five nights (52 pounds). Never again.        	                5	1	Sunday	priceline	negative

288	            I have been using Priceline ever since for booking my travels. It is great website. I know they are getting better but it always takes both ends for accountability. I know convenience is one of the main purpose of sites like this, but for a consumer like me, I do my part meaning exhaust all options before booking or making a decision. Because in the end, if you are already right there it will be difficult to make changes or get stressed about it. For Priceline, ensure the consumer that what are being posted by companies on your site is really trustworthy meaning what they say is really what you are getting.        	                1	4	Friday	priceline	positive

327	            I contacted a phone number that was suppose to lead directly into the hotel. I was not looking for a third party vendor. The hotel had some issues with billing, not at the fault of Priceline, but when trying to reconcile my business trip with the charges that were on Priceline, they could not be divided evenly into the three day stay I had with the property in Ontario, CA. When I called Customer Service to explain the mix up btw them and the hotel, the agent basically said, sorry there isn't anything I can do with that. Also the phone number given to me to contact Reservation Counter was inaccurate and I had to research on my own to find a working number. Lastly, when I was making the reservation the phone attendee had such a strict accent that I could not understand him which is probably why I got screwed in the whole process.        	                2	2	Tuesday	priceline	negative

330	            I googled “Priceline Canada” was brought to the site that I believed to be Canadian. I booked my hotel then notice it was charged $50 more that it said when I booked it. I went back to website to find out why and saw in the bottom of the page in small writing that it is in American dollars. I called Priceline to cancel and they wouldn’t do it, saying that because it is such a great deal I’m locked in. When I got to the hotel I was told that they would have only charged $155 per night for that room when I paid $186. Not a deal at all!! Not happy with Priceline at all.

343	            First issue is that prices go up constantly through your search. My wife and I can do a search at the same time for the exact same search parameters and get different prices. Second issue, booked a flight, got to the Delta check-in and they tell me we can't check-in because my son will be 2 days past his 2nd Birthday. I was required to give his birthday on the priceline website, why wouldn't they warn me that this would be an issue? I called priceline to cancel the the return flight and was told that I couldn't cancel even though I had paid for a cancellation policy. The lady on the phone says oh I can't change anything. You should talk to Delta (1).I tell her I'm standing in front of a Delta rep and have spoken with them. oh ok can you talk to Delta (2). I tell her I have and that they advise cancelling the return flight. well, i can't change anything. Could you possibly talk to Delta (3)? This goes on for another 15 min to the point that Delta is starting to think this joke. Luckily the Delta manager was so shocked at how useless priceline is that she worked her magic to get us on the flight.        	                2	1	Tuesday	priceline	neutral

376	            Looked at flights for an early morning, non stop. There was a 6:25 and a 6:40 right next to each other. Chose the 6:40 only to get the airport and find out it was 6:40 pm not am. Who puts those 2 times next to each other? Had to change our flight which cost $50 a person. Why wouldn't you make it more confident for customers and have it in chronological order. I will never use priceline again. We were emotional while picking flights because my grandmother is in the hospital and Priceline just made it that much more difficult. When we chose the 6:25 flight first only 2 seats were available when needed 3 so 6:40 seemed the obvious choice. This site is not used friendly. I recommend either the airline itself or expedia.        	                1	1	Saturday	priceline	negative

The availability and the price notifications for each available Hotel makes each trip and experience which is enjoyable because there are times when you're there for pleasure and want that little extra comfort and accessibility. Other times all it is is a room to sleep so you can get up and do the work you need to in the morning and yeah that is available when you sign up you know what you're doing and where you're going        	                1	5	Friday	priceline	positive

393	"            Their ""detailed"" explanation of the properties are very misleading and will fool you. One of them said that they had breakfast buffet for a fee, if you read it among a big paragraph, it will confuse you and make you think that the breakfast buffet is for free, not for a fee. Customer Service was non existent and cold. they didn't care and did nothing to help the situation nor tried to resolve it. They didn't cancel the reservation nor comped the breakfast.

410	            This property is presented as a luxury resort hotel with many amenities. It in fact is a lame attempt to sell timeshares there. We stayed in a strip type motel room with curbside parking and entrance nuch like a Motel 6 or the like. The site wide wifi as advertised runs at 2megs and they charge by the day to struggle with it. It is too slow to run most apps and will not stream any video. It does have an indoor and outdoor pool as listed. There's no mention of them being far removed from the rooms in its own area. I could go on with a horrible getaway for a long weekend compliments of a misleading property listed on Priceline. I deserve a refund.        	                2	2	Wednesday	priceline	negative

TV was nice but no guide for channels. They didn’t have a sign for do not disturb. Kitchenette was very nice and fridge was large. Bed was comfortable but there was no extra blanket.

The price was great and we never experienced any problems. This last trip we took to Italy was amazing! At first I was a little nervous about it because it involved connecting flights but it went smoothly. The cost was so reasonable and the flights were perfect! We flew Aer Lingus to Dublin with a short layover and then to Rome. On the return flight we flew British Airways with a layover in London. Our flights were on time and great!

Saved Money for the Company, more importantly I was able to locate something much closer to my next morning destination and cut my LA traffic commute to nothing. I recommend Priceline for anyone with that needs resolutions for accommodations in a timely manner. Sometimes it's rough paying before you know what your getting though the savings has well been worth it for my personal expenses.

Expect to receive confirmation within minutes of booking with a detailed breakdown of what you've booked. There were no hidden fees when you go to check-out, everything was consistent throughout. You also don't need to show anything from Priceline to the Airline/Hotel/etc. This was important to me because I don't like having to print out a confirmation to show to someone.

524	            If I could give Priceline zero stars I would. There is no reason for even 1 star. I booked a non refundable reservation for 2 rooms and need to confirm with the hotel that one room was a double and the other a king which thankfully I did because when I contacted the hotel, they didn’t have my reservation. I went around and around with Priceline. “Someone will look into it tomorrow” Tomorrow game and went the. I had to call again, “oh I’m sorry actually someone will contact you about it tomorrow (again)”. Next day nothing. I called again and kept getting the run around and finally they agreed to refund me my money. I was hoping it was a glitch and a isolated incident so I waited a day and then booked again. I called to confirm the hotel had my reservation and NOPE. They didn’t. Called Priceline and Luis, who I spoke to, said I’m going to look into this and call you in 15 min. 2 days later and I never received a call. I did a online chat with them and they said “it can take 24-48 hours for the hotel to update their system” (even though the hotel tells me it takes 2 hrs and the first Priceline employee told me up to 24 hrs). I wanted 48 hrs and the hotel still doesn’t have my reservation.  This time I was smart and had booked a more expensive room that I was able to cancel so I did. I will NEVER book through Priceline again. I could only imagine if I hadn’t wanted to confirm with the hotel on the 2 rooms what it would have been like to actually show up to the hotel assuming I had reservations, for them to say “we don’t have anything for you” with 6 people in our group and one of them her birthday. Unfortunately people don’t usually look at BBB until after a situation.  But after seeing all the 1 stars her I don’t understand why priceline hasn’t been shut down.        	                1	1	Thursday	priceline	neutral

526	"            Fees are used to make up for the difference in lower hotel rates. Often you will see a hotel discounted more than normal, but the fees will be double what they normally are so if you are not watching you will end up actually paying more than hotels with higher rates because of the excessive fees charged by Priceline. I'm not referring to resort fee either. Just the Taxes and Fees section. Also, they will make up ""coupons"" or different room names, so you can not use the best price guarantee if you find a lower rate elsewhere. When you book a room they will say a coupon was automatically applied to that rate, Even though there really wasn't. They just put the word coupon next to the rate or call it a mobile discount, so they can deny any price match claims by saying they aren't allowed with coupons or discounts.  Same with room types. The hotels website and other booking sites might have 3 types of rooms for that hotel like King, Queen, double, but Priceline will add a room or call it something different like standard deluxe, so you can't compare it to other sites and use for price match guarantee. They tell you the room has to be the same type, which it is, but Priceline claims it's not because they named it something different. It's all just a scam.

537	            I’m 60 year old Marine Corp Veteran I had booked a rental for November 14 until 18th in Phoenix thru price line , I over looked the booking conditions as a result when I cancelled for reasons out of my control there was no refund no credit , so my mistake for over looking the booking conditions terms which it cost me $87.90 , being a Veteran, let alone a person , explaining my situation on their chat line I got no mercy no understanding, just unfortunately there is no refund, no credit at all . Well lesson learned by me that cost me ($87.90)  costly mistake of course , my fellow veterans and seniors softball players here in central Texas including myself will not be using there services going forward , of course my team travels every year to go play senior softball . It is what it is , literally no understanding just read the terms and conditions on a prepaid rental, you have to actually click on the conditions to see that there is no refunds no credit regardless of cancellation, which I’ve admitted over looking. This of course was in reference to booking #153-722-314-38 through price line .com !

578	            I booked a British Airways flight from Texas to London with the flight costing $1,059 + flight insurance $68.87 for April 17, 2018. Unfortunately, unforeseen events occurred and I was not able to make my trip to London. I called months before my flight date and the only option that was offered to me was to put my flight credit on hold until Nov 19th 2018. The flight was non refundable or transferable. The only fees they mentioned were the re-booking fees of $275 + $30. The agent told me that as long as I use my credit before Nov 19th, 2018 there will be no problem re-booking the flights. Firstly, Priceline's customer service is subpar..every agent I spoke to was rude, short tempered, and uninformed. I was not informed that my my flight insurance from the original flight was non-transferable so $68.87 was stolen from me right off the bat. Skip ahead a few months to June of 2018... I called Priceline to use my flight credit and book new flights. I was shocked at how I was treated and mislead. The website at the time of re-booking listed flights From Texas to London to cost around $1,200. When I spoke to a Priceline agent to book the flight she told me it would be $5,000+ for the same exact flight. I asked her why they did not honor the current price listed on their own website and she told me that the prices on the website are 'discounted rates' and can only be used when buying a flight for the first time. Since I was using a credit I had with the company I was not authorized to the 'discounted rate'!...The agent went on to blame British Airways for the price hike and told me it was not Priceline's fault. I asked her if the price would drop in the near future or if this is the normal rate of $5,000?? She told me that this is the rate she usually sees when re-booking flights...I then called British Airways and asked them their rate on the same exact flight and they quoted me around $1,200...The agent at British Airways told me that they do not hike up the price. This lead me to understand that Priceline is a shady company that I will never use again. When I placed my flight on hold I should of been informed that all flights are inflated 4-5x over the original rate paid. I do not understand how this is legal?!?!? I could not afford to pay the $5,000 total amount to rebook my flight..it would of been totally pointless because I could of purchased a brand new flights at a fraction of the cost.In Conclusion, I was not able to take my trip to London because of the 5x price hike on the ticket price and Priceline has stolen $1,128.43 from me. If I could rate the company a negative 4 stars I would in a heartbeat. This is the first time I have ever written a negative review about any company. Please learn from my experience and never use any of Priceline's services.        	                1	1	Tuesday	priceline	negative

585	            No refunds &amp; long customer service hotline waiting times with Priceline Priceline might get you a better airfare than booking directly via an airline's website, but when things go wrong with your flight, it is extremely difficult to secure a refund or compensation. I booked a British Airways flight and, as often happens with BA, the flight was cancelled as BA's IT systems failed. In fact, all BA Heathrow flights were cancelled that Wednesday 18 July 2018 after the IT systems failed around 4pm. BA insisted I claim my refund through Priceline.com. It took around 3 hours over 4 attempts waiting for Priceline to direct my call to a Customer Service Rep. They asked me to contact BA directly but eventually agreed they would file the refund on my behalf and contact me within 2 weeks once they'd heard from BA. Of course 4 weeks later they had not replied and to date I've been unsuccessful in getting through to Priceline on the phone. So I've chosen to write off this refund but I will never be booking through Priceline.com again. I admit BA are an airline with appalling customer service and getting a refund from them is complex and time consuming but I have been successful where i have booked direct.        	                2	2	Tuesday	priceline	negative

604	"            The worst customer service ever, I booked a room at the Marriott hotel in Paris for my husband, my 10 month old and I, the room policy said they accepted up to 2 children under age age of 12 in the room and they provide free Crib and breakfast included, Priceline took the money, then Oops, the hotel can not accommodate my reservation! interestingly enough the same room is freaking still available on Priceline website and other websites. They offer to relocate me and I nicely accepted despite spending over a week looking through all options, hotels, location, the rooms criteria, reading the reviews, finding the best value for money and all the details. They relocated me to Napoleon hotel which was in my opinion kind of tiny downgrade, at least location wise, as the Marriott in the main champs-Elysées street and the other one is not, but whatever, no big deal I thought. non the less feeling that they sold me a product they do not have to start with (I can't prove that though), but it is called a scam in my opinion.   few days later I contact the New Hotel (Napoleon) asking whether the crib is free of charge as Marriott was, to My surprise, the agent who relocate me according to the hotel email did book the ""Classic"" room that accommodate max 2 adults and not children at all.I called Priceline to clarify that and no one can help me, they actually lied to me telling me it is the hotel policy and they can not change it, when the hotel email clearly said that specific room is not safe for children, but they have other ones that my accommodate us. so Priceline asked for 1 to 3 business days to ""see what they can do"" they failed to admit there mistake, they tried to put it on the hotel back, they were not able to call me on my International phone number (as I am not in the US at the time of the events), they won't let me talk to a manager (they directed me to the website), they do not care that even if they refund me in 3 days the hotel prices online is going to double (actually that is where they want to take me I feel, to trap, gaining some time until I can not afford last minute prices so I will accept whatever they offer me) they also were rude enough to encourage me to go for dispute through my credit card to get my money back... Unbelievable, can't imagine that there is still in US a company that treats there customers  this way... wow!        "	                1	1	Sunday	priceline	positive

I was left out in the hotel lobby with my wife, only had money to spend for the days we were there and not a cent more, PRICELINE said they cant help me book another hotel , they said sorry bye bye. I was stranded, I had to book another hotel with the only money I had, which was very expensive booking a hotel on the weekend same day, I pay wayyyyy more and most hotel were completely booked out, after I got a hotel I had no money , my wife and I was in Vegas with no money, couldn't attend anything or dine anywhere good other then subway and mcdonalds. They offer no help, and were very rude and show no empathy why I was crying for help.. All i wanted was just to have a good time with my wife for our anniversary it turned into the worst time ive had in my life ... PRICELINE IS TERRIBLE...

609	            First time I book with priceline. and last time.After I book the flight, I receive an email a minute later with a confirmed itinerary number and ticket number for each of the flight. That was 2 AM in the morning. I go to sleep. Only to be called 3 hours later (5 AM!) while sleeping. I did not answer as I was sleeping so a message was left to my voicemail. I wake up a 7 am and see the message was informing me that the airline company did not confirm the seats. Not sure how priceline issues ticket numbers and confirmations without having secured the seats. I call priceline. After being on the phone for 45 minutes, the conclusion is that they did not cancel themselves and my only option is that I book another flight. Ironically, they don't say at all anything about the airline company not confirming the seats. Even more, the customer service rep (who despite being very nice and friendly) tries to tell me several times that it was me who cancelled the ticket because it's not priceline who cancelled. eventually, it's useless. They won't admit that they cancelled my ticket. At some point, the rep evens says it might be united airlines who cancelled the ticket since it's not them. Eventually, I hung up and called united and gave them the confirmation number (imagine! I was issued a UNITED confirmation number without having seats on the different flights not sure how!). The United rep tells me directly that she sees that it was priceline who cancelled the ticket and not them. I call priceline again. Told them United told me that it was you who cancelled the ticket. the guy asks to keep me on hold for 5 minutes and then comes back and says: yeah it seems when you booked the flight there was someone who booked at the same time and that seat was no longer available, that's why we had to cancel.Like what the hell?! It took you 3 hours to discover that the seat was bought by someone else? How about you just admit that you were showing a non existent flight on your website, and that you're slow at updating flights, and then when I booked the flight it was already booked out or that the price went up and you don't want to pay the price difference yourself?Such a bad experience. especially that I had bought other flights based on that flight! Never using priceline again. Stick to Expedia guys. Their algorithms are much more efficient than priceline.        	                1	1	Sunday	priceline	negative

618	            Express deals do not work well with a resort in Vegas. Sight unseen you'll end up getting Circus Circus which is a shabby decrepit resort advertising themselves as 3 star or higher hotel. They then bait and switch Priceline bidders by putting them in an even shabbier hotel they annexed across the street. You then pay an upcharge to get into the actual resort.

628	"            This is my first time traveling to NYC and I booked through an express deal. Priceline mentioned this booking as a 3-star hotel being close to a Marriott, Hilton Sq, and/or Best Western. The website also mentioned this hotel being near Madison Sq Garden. Upon booking and the hotel being revealed, I came to understand that the hotel actually comes in at a 2.9 star and has very poor reviews about safety, cleanliness, and quality-- many negative customer experiences. I called Priceline immediately to see if there was any flexibility to re-accomodate me to a safer location as I'll be traveling alone. I was even willing to pay more to get relocated to another hotel. Unfortunately the representatives were poorly trained and treated me horribly, even to go so far as to state: ""Ma'am, you knew what you were signing up for when you signed terms and conditions."" Terrible, terrible words to say to a customer concerned for her own safety. They even went so far as to say ""If something happens upon you reaching the hotel, you can try giving us a call back and we'll try to see what we can do"". Meaning they expect me to call them after an incident has occurred-- I have never dealt with a company that can treat a customer so poorly.I actually had to lose the $1K+ I spent on that mistake of a deal and rebooked through Trivago. I lost $1200 on a mistake that I will never make again. Severely disappointed by the situation and treatment. Priceline has forever lost a valued customer.

637	            I set up flight, hotel and rental car package through priceline and let me tell you it was like having your own little travel agent. You pick your preferred flight time, preferred hotel and star preference and set your rental car budget. They keep you on track with flight emails to check in and select seats and with any flight status updates. Everything went smooth, was prepaid and all I had to do was show up with I'd and credit card for incidentals. Last but not least, the bundle helped save me tons of money!!

687	"            Priceline is a better-than-average option for discount prices on hotel reservations, airline flights, and car rentals.  You can also accumulate points using a priceline.com Visa card for all your purchases with the card and you get more points for priceline.com purchases that you make with the credit card.  These points can then be used in conjunction with money to purchase lodging, airline flight tickets, and car rentals.  One grief I have with priceline.com is that they can make mistakes like overbooking rooms at certain low prices without clearing it with the hotel, causing the hotel to either lose potential money on the transaction or to turn down the customer for the Priceline-booked room at the Priceline price or offer the customer a higher-priced room, then paying the hotel for the difference.  This can make for a bad situation for all involved: the hotel, the customer, and even Priceline.  Another ""beef"" I have with Priceline is that they have tracking cookies that allow them to ""hound"" me with advertisements of hotels, flights, or car rental offers from Priceline that I may have been looking at recently.

We got to the hotel and they couldn’t even get in our room the door was locked and the manager couldn’t get it open. We really wanted a hotel with a Jacuzzi , that was the only room left at that hotel so he offered us a refund. We took it and booked a room at a different hometown hotel that had a Jacuzzi a room we could get in. We never got our refund and ended up paying for two hotels that night. I tried to get it sorted out with priceline and they called the hotels to verified but for some reason the hotel said that we stayed at both of them the same night.        	                2	3	Tuesday	priceline	neutral

I contacted Priceline and they said booked it thru Agoda and told me to contact Agoda.

722	            I was buying a ticket from SFO to Guangzhou at 5th Oct evening, the flight was at 8th Oct. Google flight offers 3 options, and I chose Priceline, which became a disaster to me.Via Priceline website, I selected the dates and flights, all went well, and put in my credit card info. But the website got stuck there, and was never able to proceed, I tried two times, all failed, then I gave up.Then I got into the airline website, and booked the same flight, got email confirmation right away.I then went asleep an went for a short trip the next morning.On 8th Oct, after I checked in and got onboard, I got a msg from Priceline that my flight was going to take off, then I was shocked to know that Priceline booked the flight for me, two times, which means I was triple booked.And the confirmation emails came at the midnight for 6th Oct, while I was asleep on that night.I then called Priceline right away, and they were aware of my dual book via their website, but they did not do anything but wrote it down.When my flight was landed at Guangzhou, I called Priceline many times, and they refused to refund me for anything.Please DON't book anything from Priceline.

In the top righthand corner in a little drop down that says in US dollars. No where when you put in your information and credit card does it tell you that you will be charged in US funds. REALLY!?

745	            Priceline sometimes finds better deals, but if you find a better walk-in rate, Priceline won’t reimburse the difference, which I think is crap. Plus, they take too long to send payment to the hotel, so the hotel also charges the customer, and then you’re left to deal with two charges on your cc for the same hotel stay.        	                2	3	Saturday	priceline	neutral

747	            Priceline is typically my go-to for hotel travel given the demise of VRBO/Air B&amp;B and how that company has gone down hill dramatically. But, I've always used Priceline from the beginning. My biggest issue is that when booking using their Express feature, I am unable to indicate a need for non-smoking room as rooms aren't assigned until check-in. That is not acceptable since any type of smoke triggers hateful migraines for me, as does the use of deodorizers that hotels insist on spraying in rooms while cleaning them. Just stop and start considering how smoke and these products detrimentally affect people like me. Wouldn't it be nice if Priceline got involved in spreading the word!        	                1	4	Saturday	priceline	negative

The staff was wonderful and greeted everyone with a smile. When we arrived, we found there was not room refrigerator, when we called front desk they brought a foam cooler to the room. We found that the hotel is marketed for couples, so it is not a family friendly Hotel. This is a hotel to take a ""hottie girl friend."" The white curtain decoration reminded the me of a disco. The dark elevators with jazz music from the states, was not the best for a tropical setting. The room menu sucks!The free breakfast was very good, and again the restaurant staff all get 5 stars.

I typed the info into Trivago.com, which led me to a SUPER low price on a room for the night, on Priceline.

So clicked on it set up to pay and there was an issue. Did it 3 times so I called customer support....hard to get a hold of anyone, and asked them about it. By that time the deal was no longer around she couldn't find it and I was perturbed.

We signed up for a car rental under my name with my wives credit card.  So that's what we took to pick up the car.   They would not allow us to rent the car, even though we both had ID (same last name) because it was not my CC with my name.  Ridiculous!  We've rented with others and this was never an issue.  So like I said, use another online company to rent from.  Oh and BTW....I called their help line, and all I got was ""you agreed to the fine print"" talk...not even trying to help me.

881	"            The hotel booking I made through Priceline was one of the worst travel experiences I ever had.  Forget the pretty pictures and ratings on their hotels, they're meaningless.I arrived very late at the BestWestern+ in Deerfield Beach.  The rooms are all on a catwalk.  At 2am there were teenagers partying outside my window and when I asked them to quiet down, they cursed me out.  Two minutes later, there was another group outside my window partying.  I went to check out because I didn't feel safe there and at least the person at the front desk was decent about it but when I called Priceline to ask for help to get me into another hotel at 3am with no where to go, they told me ""you're on your own."" And, I'm a woman who was traveling alone!  I finally found a place on my own and got into a room at 4:30am.  As I left through the main entrance of the hotel there was a group of people right outside smoking pot with the fumes blowing right into the lobby.The only good thing I can say is that I was able to get my money refunded -- but if you find yourself in a predicament, don't count on Priceline to help you.

893	            Priceline needs to work on its brand. The initial offering is neat and has made it well known, however it is beginning to fall into the last option of the hotel booking category because credibility in branding is not there.Perfect time to retool the brand and move to top 3 choices when online booking.Several ways to do that.        	                1	4	Thursday	priceline	positive
894	            Do not use debit card with price line I booked a hotel, which was then sold out but they still charged my card I had to wait 3weeks to get £1100 back..JOKE!!!        	                1	1	Thursday	priceline	neutral
895	            Priceline is a God awful company that treats its customers as options. They took a $15 cancellation fee on a car rental that I made with my debit card because my credit card was stolen 2 days before this tee trip that I had to make to a Festival in Atlanta. I had to cancel the car because National rental car service would not allow me to leave the airport with the rental car without a return flight iteniary. SO, I drove 40 miles to my father's and used his credit card to rent the exact same car through Natuonal using Priceline.  I tried to explain my situation to them to be told by Emerald employee number 1320187 that she does not care. I have worked in the music world in Nashville all of my life. I will be recommending all of my fellow music people here to never use them again. And, I will be putting a Priceline sucks banner behind all the future shows that I help finance and promote within reason.  Will be having hats made as well of Priceline sucks        	                1	1	Thursday	priceline	neutral

How do some get 2 stars is beyond me and on two occasions while checking in the reservationists were very rude in honoring the room rate. One hotel charged me a $20 upgrade fee. Isn’t the hotel listing the room with Priceline? The site is wonderful, no problems. The hotels however are a different story unfortunately        	                1	5	Thursday	priceline	neutral

918	            It was helpful to have my entire trip booked and paid for in one place. The only downside were the flights because the seats were not able to be selected prior to booking the flight (this could be because of the airports and airlines selected, but still an inconvenience). Other than that, this site works great for booking an entire trip and having it paid for in advance.        	                1	4	Wednesday	priceline	positive

920	            I advise you against doing business with Priceline. They will not guarantee the price and will not back you up when the car rental company does not honor the terms of your agreement with Priceline. Case in point -- I rented a car through Priceline in late September. I reserved an economy car. When I arrived on time at the vendor, Budget Rental Car, I was informed that they did not have any economy cars remaining and that I would have to pay a higher price for a higher class car. Instead of giving me another car at the economy car price, they said my only choice if I was going to get a car was to pay the higher price. Given that it was 9 pm, I reluctantly agreed to pay the higher price. I did so under protest. When I contacted Priceline Customer Service, they were unhelpful, telling me to take up my complaint with Budget. They washed their hands of the matter. Anyway, so much for Priceline and their price guarantees. Don't bother doing business with them        	                1	1	Wednesday	priceline	neutral

If you have no other money ur sh#t out of luck! Be sure to have back up money handy and always be repared to pay a deposit for incedentals. Ive seen anywhere from $15 to $100 pre auth or immediate hold of the funds, which yet again you wont see back in your account for 2 - 10 days.

975	            I’m not one to complain about customer service. I don’t even send my order back when it is wrong at a restaurant, and I still tip. This is going to be my first negative review. Priceline should not show rooms available for overbooked hotels. When you do, and there are absolutely no rooms with the same star rating available anywhere within a 45 mile radius of the original location, you should be able to get a room more than half of a star better. Priceline does not allow upgrades more than half of a star. It took us well over an hour on the phone with a Priceline customer service rep, Reuben, and supervisor to get re-booked. The worst part is that the supervisor, Mario, told us there was nothing he could do except refund us what we paid plus 20%, because he could not find any available rooms except one that was two and a half hours away. We found a room on Priceline that was only 30 minutes away, but he said that he had called and it didn’t exist. I called from a different phone, and the lady said she had plenty rooms. After telling Mario this, he called and booked it for us. This was the worst customer service experience that I’ve ever witnessed, and I’ve seen pretty poor service several times. My wife and I both work with customers daily at our jobs, so we realize how pitiful it really was.        	                1	1	Monday	priceline	negative

977	            Best hotel prices and best customer service. When the booked hotel oversold the room and didn't allocate me, priceline offered me booking to other better hotel at no extra cost. It didn't stop there, they issued refund for the night they couldn't manage, given some rebate and offered to compensate for breakfast if not included in other hotel. I was impressed with customer focused service.        	                1	5	Monday	priceline	positive
978	            I have used Priceline twice.  The first time I was in need of a hotel after being in a hospital all day with a relative who was expected to pass.  I was having a hard time finding a hotel in the area that I could afford that would accommodate the four of us.  I ended up calling the number on the website and the lady I spoke to called one of the local hotels nearby and negotiated a room at a price I could pay.  I am forever grateful for her help.  When I needed to return to the area for the funeral I used Priceline again and easily found a good deal on a room near the funeral home.

I've gotten some amazing deals with little effort, and the few times I've needed to contact customer service, my issues were addressed completely and pleasantly.

985	            The service was trustworthy and gave us what it advertised.  We were very happy with the hotel, location and price.  However, it was not clear the prices were in USD - we’re Canadian and were not aware the prices were in USD. Thankfully, while not as good a deal as it originally looked, it was still a good deal.        	                1	5	Sunday	priceline	positive

My room had Black Mold on a wall picture that had water damage so I called Priceline to complain but never heard back from them please try to do better. Quality Inn @ Lutherville,Timonium Maryland don’t use that hotel worst experience ever. Ask to see your room if by chance you have to stay there. Just go down the street to the Holiday Inn it’s better. I could not even give it a review it was so bad. Breakfast Food terrible same thing every day just reheated. A damn sham I was  so 🤬 😡 I cried when I was talking to Priceline the gentleman  said he understand my  frustration and he will take care of it what he did I don’t know but they never contacted me about it try to do better priceline        	                1	4	Saturday	priceline	negative
1015	            I don't feel the 3 star rating on our motel was accurate.  It was more of a 2 due to the fact that the property is maintained very well.        	                1	3	Saturday	priceline	neutral

1017	"            In this instance I feel I was able to book the hotel at a great rate through Priceline.  If Priceline would make it easier to identify the ""got-ya"" fee's like parking and resort fee's the website would be even better.  They tend to hide these fee's.  The fee's are buried and hard to find even for a regular user.  Even when seeking them out it is difficult to determine if you are going to be charged additional fee's.  And if booking an express deal there is no way to call the hotel in advance.  Overall, if Priceline would find a way to simply list the bottom line ""out the door"" price with all fee's and taxes included the service would be top notch.  Otherwise, be careful when booking and make sure you understand you may be charged a $20/day resort fee or $10/day parking fee that is not included in the listed price.

1021	            I arrived to the airport on time for my scheduled flight at 9:00 a.m. I then found out that the flight time was changed to 8:30 A.M. I did not receive any notification from Priceline on the change of flight. Jet Blue informed me that since I purchased my flight tickets from Priceline, Priceline was suppose to notify me about the change in departure time.  I missed my schedule flight and I am very unhappy about this occurrence. it is a most unpleasant feeling to find out, only upon arriving to the airport, that I missed my flight because of a time change that Priceline did not inform me about.  I woke up in the middle of the night, to then travel in it to the airport to ensure that I’d make it here on time. I arrived at the airport at 7:30 a.m. assuming I had plenty of time to check in and be on my flight of 9:00am.  At 8:15 A.M I was unable to check into my flight and it was only then that I found out about the flight change.  I had no choice but to reschedule my flight for the only later time which is at 8:00PM! I had to also reschedule all of my other reservations for the day. I am disgusted at this inconvenience that Priceline has put me through. I would have appreciated any kind of notification to tell me about the flight schedule change. Instead I am now stuck at the airport, losing an entire day of my vacation that I planned months ago. I will never use this service again for any of my vacations and I will never recommend anyone to use Priceline.        	                1	1	Saturday	priceline	negative
1022	            This was a first experience using Priceline and I did so because the hotel suggested it as a means to be able to pay for a hotel room for my daughter so that she did not have to when she arrived. There were other options and Priceline presented a price (no hidden deal) and gave me the option of using PayPal to pay in addition to credit card processing. The only thing I experienced that concerned be was the use of PayPal seemed to be less immediate than I expected as it took 15 minutes for the hotel to see the reservation; but all worked out great in the end.        	                1	5	Saturday	priceline	positive

1030	            My stay at The Fairmount Royal York Hotel was pleasant. From the front desk you already feel welcomed with knowledgeable staff. The elevators are full of character with expectional woodwork. As you pass by the security on the floor on your way to your room you feel safe. Once you enter your room you will be welcomed with a stocked mini fridge, a functional desk and a comfy bed. After you have settled in head down to the health club for a nice swim, workout and steam room experience to get refreshed if you wish. Now you can check out the bar, restaurant or venture out into the city for many dinning or entertainment venues within a close distance. In short I recommend this Hotel for people who expect a high level of customer satisfaction. 5 stars. Enjoy your stay and rest easy!

1044	            Recently I booked to stay through priceline down on the Texas coast, and found a very nice hotel for extremely low price. Thinking the only reason for this was for off-season purposes and no further explanation given on the website, we booked the hotel without further hesitation… Upon arrival, the hotel was undergoing major renovations with major sections barricaded off and lots of loud construction noise in the room right next to ours throughout the day making midday rests nearly impossible especially for our 14 month old toddler who really needed his naps! This isn’t the only issue I’ve had with Priceline being vague and unclear on terms of bookings and other things, so I’ll have to say that I will probably look at other agencies for my upcoming trips.        	                1	3	Friday	priceline	neutral

1073	            I have always had good experiences with Priceline using their Express Deals. However, this time I saw an Express Deal that was regular priced at $125-$135. The Priceline Express Deal price was $80. I went ahead and booked it. I liked the hotel that I got, but the regular price for the hotel was $86/night. I feel like they falsely advertised the price. I was expecting to get a much better hotel by the price they were saying the room was being booked for.        	                1	2	Wednesday	priceline	positive

1107	            For the most part , Priceline has saved me money and has been reliable. I have two experiences where they dropped the ball but have used them often so that is why they still get four stars.  The good outweighs the negative.  My advice is to use them when your trip is planned and avoid them in last minute situations.        	                1	4	Tuesday	priceline	neutral

The fifth room was billed $15.49 in additional fees even though the room rate didnt change and all things were equal between the 5 rooms. Spoke to a live customer service rep and chatted with one online and neither could resolve this issue.

1119	            Customer service is a SCAM. Spent over 2 hours with 2 representatives. Kept contradicting what the hotel was telling me about canceling my reservation. The hotel was willing to cancel and issue me a full refund however I was told by priceline the hotel refused the cancellation and I went back and forth with the hotel and priceline and received two different stories so I called the hotel on 3 way much to the dismay of the priceline rep and the hotel said they never even tried calling them! Even though I was put on hold for 15 minutes. It’s not worth saving a few bucks for the AWFUL scam system they run        	                1	1	Monday	priceline	negative
1120	            I use the Priceline function that reveals the name of the hotel after booking - a bit of a gamble that I enjoy. I only book this way after doing a great deal of research and only when I know that the designated area is within my distance tolerance for the activities I plan to do. I have repeatedly been pleased with the revealed hotel, and it is often a higher-rated hotel than I would normally pay for. If you have the right personality to take a bit of a risk and can tolerate a bit of uncertainty, you can be rewarded using Priceline.        	                1	5	Monday	priceline	positive

They stated they would speak to the manager but then never did - they also said they would get in contact with them first thing in the morning and leave a message on my file to clear this up as my booking date was supposed to be for the next day.

1168	            Located in Fraternity/Sorority Row.This isn't a super huge hotel. I was able to park and pack all the baby gear to the room without trudging super long distances. I wish that it had an indoor pool but the outdoor pool area is very nice and there's even a gas firepit with lots of seating. The pool isn't zero depth; so more appropriate for larger children. Avoid the Chili's that is attached to the parking garage. We had to wait 45 minutes for our food and almost as long for our check, and the food was, meh! Try the Sports Bar around the Other Corner: much better food!        	                2	5	Saturday	priceline	positive

1174	            Booking a Birthday getaway for the two youngest of my three GrandDaughters to Disney....It was their first time! We had taken our Oldest GrandDaughter a few years before on a similar trip and the experience was Awesome, so we decided to repeat it with the two youngest....The smiles and memories are Unforgettable! Like with our oldest GrandDaughters trip, I found Priceline to have better pricing and an easy booking experience this time as well. I checked with Disney Direct and several other Travel booking engines online and could not beat Priceline's prices and availability. Will use Priceline again and again and again and Highly recommend to all my Friends and Family!Thank You Priceline, The Fox Family of TampaBay!        	                1	5	Friday	priceline	positive

1178	            Had I not called ahead to the hotel to verbally confirm my reservation I would not have gotten the jacuzzi suite in which I thought I had booked through Priceline.

The hotel checked it out online and sure enough the wrong photo was posted. The hotel fixed it and I got the jacuzzi suite for NO extra charge        	                1	3	Friday	priceline	negative

1181	            Details of experiences are seemingly accurate. The star rating of locations has been comparable to how I'd rate and I travel a lot so I know what real people want like safety, comfortable beds, clean room and environment, and convenient amenities and toiletries.

1188	            Priceline is my #1 go to App  in finding a motel, They always are comparable or cheaper than their competitors. I feel Priceline should always check out there consumers reviews and complaints. Some of the motels  are not well lit and unsafe along with being filthy.  In my opinion  they need to drop that hotel not necessarily the chain but the ones in certain cities that don't meet standards that the good majority of us expect when we stay in a hotel for the night.        	                1	5	Friday	priceline	positive

1194	            I booked an Express deal thru priceline.com which was supposedly a 3 star hotel.The reservation was processed by Booking.com and upon arrival we discovered it was barely a 2 star hotel. In attempting to rate my experience the Priceline website refused to log me on. When I attempted to use their chat line I was cut off after entering my complaint because I am a 2 finger typist and slow.        	                1	2	Thursday	priceline	negative
1195	            My husband and I were hugely impressed with this site.  We booked our hotel and flights from Priceline, aka, Booking.com.  Our hotel was wonderful, we had such a great time. We booked our room with the Marriott Kaua'i Courtyard Coconut Beach and it was truly wonderful, a dream honeymoon.  We also booked our flights and all information was provided us on the web site.  I printed out our receipt and took it to the airport to receive our tickets with no difficulties whatsoever!!!  We were very impressed.  No hassels, no problems, exactly the trip we dreamed of for many years.  We are planning another trip and will use Priceline again.        	                1	5	Thursday	priceline	positive

1197	            Priceline has great pricing compared to other sites and even better pricing for return members however take care to secure a tangible transaction histories and numbers, (screen pics) when making reservations via Express Deals.  Have experienced three separate occasions where the original room and star rating selected was substituted and reduced somehow after booking was thought to be complete.  Quite a mess to remedy.  Read travel details thoroughly and in their entirety immediately upon confirmation.  We found it better to call in directly to address discrepancies and cancellation fees for substitutions.  Also, if amenities are crucial to your stay, you may wish to call your facility in advance as insurance does not cover a pool or hot tub that is not functioning.  Ah yes, insurance...there's another good read.        	                1	3	Thursday	priceline	positive

1202	            I love priceline for booking flights. Just don't have a last minute change when booking a hotel room on priceline or your in for some frustration for sure. I booked my boss and myself a few rooms and he needed  to check in a day earlier and leave a day earlier and I got told essentially to pound sand. This is why I may not book another room on here because there is ZERO flexibility. I managed to call the hotel, have priceline call the hotel and it got worked out in the end but it took awhile and I feel I got lucky. Beware.        	                1	3	Thursday	priceline	positive

I then found out that the flight was ticketed and I never received an email with an itinerary or anything regarding a confirmed flight. I called everyday for almost a month in regards to a refund for this almost $500 flight. I was told a refund would be issued within 24-48 hours, to call this specific person, someone would call me in regards to my refund, and then that it would take 6-8 weeks. I became so irritated with them I finally just filed fraud charges with them since they REFUSED to give me a refund by making me run around and wait forever with no solution.

1277	            It was very nice and relaxing, i loved the gym and steam room area. The hospitality was almost perfect if it was not for the staff working in the lobby cafe/bar. Me and my wife are on our honeymoon and purchased some delicious cookies from the local bakery and was told we were not allowed to have them woth our tea that I bought from the lobby cafe/bar and i was confused because they serve cookies themselves but i did not like the cookies they served which is why i went outside the hotel to purchase cookies that me and my newly married wife very much loved. We were rudely told to go to our room and have our cookies. It was very unprofessional of the lobby cafe/bar staff. It was very unlike the remainder of my experience with the staff, who were very nice and professional and helpful. The door man was very nice and so was the staff and manager at the reception.

1310	            As per my trip review.  Hotel above average, but trip spoiled by Car Hire experience through Priceline.  Website says debit card is available to be used as payment, and that Hire Co. will charge a refundable deposit to your card.  We were ready to have $250-$500 charged as deposit.  However, when we went to pick up vehicle, they refused as 'no debit cards accepted'.  Felt cheated and let down by Priceline as the booking fee and liability insurance was non-refundable.  (I gave two stars because the Hotel was perfectly acceptable).        	                2	2	Sunday	priceline	negative

1328	"            I have used Priceline to book hotels for several trips over the years and each time it was a smooth process. Because my needs/wants like bed choices, room size, and amenities eare not always the same, I have booked hotels through all the variety of ways on Priceline. Booking a hotel with the ""Name your own price  tool"" can yield  a huge price savings but doesn't always yield the wants/needs at the time so I can always fall back to ""Express Deals"" or the best advertised pricing and know that I am getting the best value for my money. Priceline's website is nicely laid out and makes it easy to navigate while being custom tailored to the preferences of my trip. I think they are one of, if not, the best travel sites out there. I have always recommend them to family and friends and wouldn't hesitate do the same to a stranger.        "	                1	5	Saturday	priceline	positive

1342	"            I get excellent prices on hotels; there are two special aspects to Priceline worth mentioning: 1. there are often hotels that you can get for phenomenally low prices for their ratings, on which the listing shows the rating and the price without naming the hotel, which almost always is at least as good as its rating when you see what it is and when you actually get there. 2. the ""Name Your Own Price"" feature, under which you put in a bid of a price for some hotel of a rating level that you select; if a hotel of that rating or higher is willing to give you a room on the dates selected for that price, they give you the highest-rated hotel that would accept the bid.

My room ended up costing $89/night.  That was no bargain!Also, due to extenuating circumstances, my trip was cut short by one night.  I stayed four nights instead of five.  When I requested a refund from Priceline, I was denied, even though others told me they were able to get refunds.  I'm not happy about this.

1350	            Booked a room for my girlfriend, when she got the hotel they demanded payment again after I had paid online. So she left and when I contacted Priceline about getting my money back the guy refused to refund the money, I filed s complaint with visa about them and will dispute the transaction when it hits my account. The guy I spoke to later as I was tied up and could not call right then told me 4 hrs later she was okay to go back which was too late at that point.        	                2	1	Friday	priceline	negative
1351	            Sometimes the car rental agency says unlimited miles but doesn't mean that if you are a 'local driver' b/c some people in that profile steal cars. Read the fine print about any deal you make on this site. Do not trust the graphics that say things like 'unlimited miles' or whatever else seems too good to be true.        	                1	4	Friday	priceline	positive

1359	            Nexus Hotel was a great place to stay. As I've stated before no problems at all. Minor problem was TV programming being American I wish there were more sports channels to watch and got bored watching soccer and not being current on news from the US. Also the refrigerator needed to get a lot colder as I bought food it's spoiled quickly and my two weeks stay. I would come back to the Nexus without any problem but it would be excellent if they could address those issues for me. Priceline was great, my wife is from Ethiopia and checked out the hotel before I came there. It lived up to its reputation.        	                1	5	Thursday	priceline	positive

1383	            Prior to booking with Priceline I always check other offers from other companies/websites. Priceline ALWAYS wins on the cost of the room! I absolutely LOVE Priceline! I get nervous when I let Priceline pick the room at X price. (Especially when every other hotel is sold out!)  iI begain to  tell you how many times I have checked in and the hotel clerk is “YOU paid WHAT?” It’s like Christmas when you see the room and rate that you are able to reserve. It’s like Vegas! So far I have gambled and Priceline hasn’t ever disappointed me or my family!!!        	                1	5	Wednesday	priceline	positive

1385	            My only concern is that if I'm traveling with an older couple of  that I can't ask for a two double beds or a handicap room within the app.  Having to call the hotel to ask for specific room requirements after confirming it is risky if they didn't have have a room available that I needed, I'd be out the money.        	                1	4	Tuesday	priceline	neutral

1387	            It would be more helpful if star ratings were more consistent. I do take into consideration town and city sizes.  For example an experience in Santa Fe boasted a 3 1/2 star hotel, when in fact it was just a glorified motel, and for Santa Fe a 2 star establishment, in a small town it would have been a 3+ star.        	                1	4	Tuesday	priceline	positive
1388	"            Priceline advertise their promos are LIES!! I booked a hotel through Priceline because it had mentioned that we will get a free parking on our stay. When we arrive at the hotel, the hotel said it doesn't provide free parking even with Priceline. Since the day we arrive there until the next day when we check out, we were communicating with PriceLine about the issue. They know it was their fault and thye ""tried"" to pay the valet for the hotel but everytime the hotel front desk help them, they were never successful. It is just $40! How does a big company like you can't cover it because it was your own mistake!! So we were on the phone with them when we are checking out because the hotel wont release our car if its not paid, after almost 2 hours!!, the hotel decided to cover for us first and let us continue our trip. Couple days after the trip, the hotel charged us the valet fee which we thought were already covered by Priceline! this is totally unacceptable. They lied in their promotions, when we told them about it (we kept a copy of the original receipt), they quickly changed it online and my email receipt doesn't have the free parking (good thing we printed out the first time). That is shady! and after almost 2 months, they still haven't resolved this issue. what kind of company does that?        "	                2	1	Tuesday	priceline	negative

1390	            Trustpilot is the only website where Priceline has a 4-star review.Priceline is the absolute worst company to do business with. I have been doing business with them for years and have recently purchased a ticket for an international flight. I wanted a slight change in my last name since I got married so I called them. They required $30 for the change which I did not have. God knows I didn't. Priceline is a billion $ company, I have made them multiple thousands of $$ over the year yet they couldn't waive $30 for me as a one-time courtesy. Their customer service representatives are overseas, can barely speak English and have no compassion. They don't care about losing a customer or bad reviews which can affect the company's revenues. I do not recommend Priceline one bit. Last time I would do business with them.        	                2	1	Tuesday	priceline	negative

I booked a one night stay for what was advertised as a 4 start hotel. I've stayed there before. It is 2 stars at best. Rooms were literally disgusting and me son and I were bit about 9 times with bed bugs. It was the Crown Plaza in San Diego. Immediately after the ""resort"" was disclosed and no longer than 4 mins after my booking I called to cancel due to the misrepresentation of the accommodations, only to be met with the poorest level of service I have ever experienced.

1450	            Horrible experience and customer service. Do not use. I used Priceline to book a hotel room without issue. Canadian hotel, Canadian dollars. Not even a week later, booked another room. This time without my knowledge the room had been charged in American. I paid over $50 more than I would have if I’d just walked into the hotel. In explaining my frustrations to the customer service agents I was met with the same script read over and over again. No actual explanation for why one week their prices were in Canadian and the next American. I was told nothing could be done. I will never use this company again and would highly recommend that others avoid at all cost. Sneaky, rip-off, and lacking compassion.        	                1	1	Sunday	priceline	negative

1452	            Free parking was given which is very rare in this city with this location.  Every sightseeing points are in maximum 30 min distance. Front steps are bery kind and helpful.  Do not expect super great breakfast but the quality was so so.  12 euro of city tax was charged when I checked out. I don’t know if this is general in Roma but that was not noticed before by hotel or priceline.        	                1	4	Sunday	priceline	neutral

1454	            In all honestly it looks like ill be using this site for good. It's amazing how much cash you save when using express and being a member with the app- I've gotten 4 nights in different 4 star hotels one being a 4.5 star? And with taxes it's no less nor more than a motel 6, which I've paid through my bottom for, (90$) for a hotel 6? Just because they're right on the major highways. No thanks I'd rather drive an extra 15 minutes, and stay in a 3.5 or 4 star for probably cheaper on express deals. I'm going to test out the bidding system tonight!        	                1	5	Sunday	priceline	positive
1455	            We booked a hotel for a soccer tournament. The price was 30% higher than what the hotel charges for the same room. We know this because other parents of kids on the team told us what they paid direct. On top of that the complimentary breakfast they got was not included with our price. RIPOFF! I would reccomend calling the hotel direct instead of paying a premium on Priceline.        	                1	1	Sunday	priceline	neutral

1462	            Priceline is outstanding !!!  We use them for all or part of every trip we take.They always deliver on price and service.  If anything is wrong ... they fix itasap.  They always have the best price, selection and even extra discountsif you sign in.  Now they own a rental car company ... car deals that no oneelse can match.

1463	            This is the worst booking. Charged my credit cards 5x but to no avail. This booking uses the strategy to gain interest in the money that they hold for their own interest. Of consumer cannot do anything to stop this scammer. The only way is prevention. DO NOT BOOK through priceline.com and booking.com because they are just one company. Whatever explanation they do please don’t consent these scams... or you’ll gonna end up getting embarassed and out of fund in your cards.

1465	"            I like Priceline because I usually find decent deals and hotels and flights. In the past, the ""name your own price"" has always given me the best deal. Lately I've been using ""express deals"" for hotels. I found you get better rates of you sign-in before you search. I gave them 4 stars because sometimes their hotel ratings are off. Also although I can collect airline miles, most hotel chains don't give you reward points for booking on Priceline.        "	                1	4	Saturday	priceline	positive

1471	            I used to use priceline constantly. However, where I used to get an amazing deal on a regular basis, I'm now only paying slightly below what it would cost if I just contacted the hotel directly. Not sure why that is but it's not nearly the deal it used to be. I will still use them to get a lower rate but I've cut my travelling by quite a bit since because of it.        	                1	4	Saturday	priceline	negative

1493	            Priceline is a roll of the dice.  The customer service is some of the WORST I have ever experienced and if you really don't care about sometimes over paying for a hotel, then use it.  I've been a customer for years and saved a lot of money over the years but also lost a lot as well.I try to avoid it when I can.  They do not stand behind their star rating and are really more of a volume shop so your business means nothing to them.        	                2	2	Friday	priceline	negative
1494	            Up until now ive never had an issue, but they got me a room i am beyond angry about and cost me so much more than just a room fee. I am hoping after the reviews i sent to them that something is fixed and i can say that they are trusted but until then i have no choice but to blame them for my experience at a hotel they booked for me and promised was going to atleast save me some money. I was Robbed by hotel staff. The room was Misrepresented and amentities were far from even acceptable. they dont run the hotels but thier suggestion and secret deal did sell me that room. i have to say this experience ruins all the good deals and happy visits i have had using priceline. I wont blame priceline If this hotel is marked properly and they  ensure that noone else will have to experience what i experienced thinking its s 3 star hotell, i like shoppers to be made aware and given the knowledge that this hotel is awful before booking it. And i would love ut if the didnt represent this hotel on the secret room deal becuaee it is not in anyway comparable to a 3 star hotel or a deal,        	                1	1	Friday	priceline	positive

1543	            Friends and Family hear my words. Do not EVER book with Priceline.com we booked a round trip flight and hotel through them June 25th of this year and when we arrived at our hotel we found out from our lyft driver that it burnt down over a month ago. Priceline line reps are giving us the run around about getting us another place to stay that is comparable. Comparable? To a burnt down building? Really? Then they come back saying they found one for us 20 miles away. Still trying waiting on them to find us a place to stay currently while we stand in a parking lot across the street. Could priceline not have told us 2 months before our trip that the hotel burnt down? #makethisright #boycottpriceline.com        	                1	1	Wednesday	priceline	positive

1548	            I reserved a rental car through Priceline in Europe for a 41 day driving vacation (I’d just retired) and also purchased  collision damage insurance at the same time through Priceline which they brokered through Global Allianz.  I paid the insurance in full 9 months before my trip and received documentation from Global Allianz.  Two weeks before my trip I found I could save $1,200 by using another company and used that company. Priceline sent me an email the night before the trip asking me to confirm or cancel their reservation, which had never been guaranteed by me with a credit card so I cancelled the reservation .  I picked up the rental car today drove to another city and just learned that Priceline cancelled my insurance coverage with Global because I cancelled my automobile rental through them.  Because I knew I had coverage that was fully paid, I waived insurance with the rental car company and now Global won’t reissue the insurance because I’ve already picked up the car.  Now I have to change my vacation to drive back to the city where I rented the car, all because Priceline cancelled my pre existing fully paid for insurance policy!! This is totally unacceptable!!        	                1	1	Tuesday	priceline	negative

1551	            My daughter and I were in town for a birthday party. We were greeted upon arrival, the staff was very friendly. Room appeared to be clean, upon further inspection the coffee maker looked like it hadn’t been cleaned or used in forever!!!  When reported to the desk they were very  apologetic and replaced immediately.  But didn’t give us anymore coffee or sugar/creamer which was requested. I had a sneezing attack, (I have dust allergies) found the cause to be the fact that the air conditioner filter was so dirty they were BLACK! We were told the indoor pool was available.... NOPE!! Chemical issues it was closed!For the most part the beds were comfy, the pillows are soft and easy to sleep on. It worked out for us, because we only slept there, spent most of the time with family, but if this were a family vacation I’d pass on this hotel.

1588	            PARKING ...The only surprise was when we received our confirmation of our hotel reservation we noticed that there could be a charge for incidentals and after reading prev reviews saw that they charge $16 /daily for parking.  Not mentioned anywhere on Priceline.  Chatted with Priceline. They said no where does it say ‘free parking’. In my opinion it is deceiving. We called hotel and confirmed indeed there is a charge and asked not to be charged for it and told them it was not mentioned on Priceline.  They obliged and did not charge us for parking.

1590	            You can still get a nice break on regular prices but seems they've changed their policy. You can no longer bid for a rental car using your own price and seems like the more you shop, the more the rates change and quickly like how airlines do it.

1594	            For the most part it's saved me quite a bit. However the stars assigned to some hotels lead one to believe some places are better than others and a few times I've found those ratings are not accurate. Not sure WHO assigns these stars but a couple of times I've stayed at places that were not at all as nice as touted to be by Priceline. Recently a place I stayed via Priceline that had a sign on the lobby door that said in 2015 Hotels.com customers had given it an 8.1,rating. I don't think they were staying at the hotel I stayed at or things had gone SERIOUSLY down hill in the intervening time.        	                4	4	Monday	priceline	positive

1599	            Horrible experience. Flight booked for San Diego to Philadelphia, debilitating accident and associated doctors letter made it impossible to fly. Called the actual flight provider (Delta), with no expectations as I didn't have a flexible ticket. However surprisingly they were happy to issue a full refund of the ticket or at the very least a voucher for it's value. The only catch being they couldn't do so until Priceline cancelled as they didn't know what Priceline had paid for the ticket. There ensured back and forth phone calls with Priceline and Delta (6 in total). Priceline claimed 'the contract' (with Delta) precluded them from cancelling the ticket without charging me a $200 fee, and that was the claim they hid behind. However Delta explained very helpfully each time, that there was no stipulation on their part, and Priceline were basically not adhering to the same discretionary policy as Delta, which according to Delta they should. Delta even told me to ask to speak to a supervisor etc etc, all to no avail. Priceline effectively stuck to their disingenuous story it was being imposed by the contract with Delta, when in reality it was just their own stipulation. All leaving a very bitter taste in my mouth. Communicating and negotiating all this was made ever more difficult as there call centre did not appear to be based in the US/the west. Whereas the Delta representatives seemed to be based in Jamaica and were easily understood, understood easily and were very amiable.

1649	            Generally speaking I'm happy with Priceline, but I questioned some of their hotel ratings.  Some hotels are rated too high and I have gotten a few hotels which do not live up to their hotel rating.  This is especially true when getting an Express deal.The Mom and Pop's hotels are some of the hotels that are ranked too high and some of the big chains are ranked too high when they don't keep them up to their star rating and should be adjusted to a lower rating.        	                2	4	Friday	priceline	neutral

1669	            Wish i would have read all the 1-star reviews on Priceline on Yelp before I booked a hotel room through them in Washington D.C. for my son's wedding.  I booked way in advance becasue I wanted to be sure to have a room for this important event.  I thought I might be able to get a better rate, based on their lowest price guarantee, so i watched prices. Sure enough, the price dropped from $125 a night to $93.  But when I tried to get the lower rate, I got the runaround. No real reason was given. (It was NOT a name-your-own price deal) No matter what i said, the answers were nonsense.  I believe the people who are paid to answer calls like mine have no authority to do anything except apologize.  Very upsetting.  I won't trust Priceline again.        	                1	1	Friday	priceline	negative

1703	            Make sure your hotel has no less than 4 stars if you’re bidding. Research the area and be specific in your neighborhood filters to weed out the seedy parts of town(s). Much as it may pain you, be prepared to pay between $70-$150 per room night for a better quality hotel, location, and experience. If the deal seems too good to be true, it usually is. With any luck, you’ll be able to find a 4-5 star hotel for $70 something rather than the $369 that they charge via their internal reservations systems. Don’t bother with anything under $60 per night unless you’re fine with blood stains, cigarette holes, and drug deals going on next door.        	                1	4	Wednesday	priceline	positive

1710	            Priceline will commit fraud to make money. They think that the majority of Americans will simply chalk it up to a bad experience. I booked two nights at super 8 in Craig Co. I was not able to stay the two nights so I talked to the front desk clerk and gave him 24 hour cancellation for the 2nd night. I stayed the first night and checked out at 6 am. I again talked to the night auditor making sure that i would not be charged for the second night. She assured me I would not. Priceline has a different idea. they charged me the second night. This is their policy as it shows on their confirmation Any cancellation received within 1 day prior to the arrival date will incur the first night's charge. I am now having to make a dispute with my credit card company after trying to reason with Priceline TWICE! I am going to make a complaint to the BBB also.....fight these pukes.

1719	"            I recently booked a trip with Priceline. There was no issues booking the trip. within a couple of days I recieved notification that the flight had changed. This happened several times over the following week. However, when I checked on the changes, I couldn't find any. This is because their system does not update to reflect the changes to the customer. I was 2 weeks out from my trip and checked on my reservations. My flight had in fact changed. The return trip had a 14 hour layover!!! I didn't know who to call to change it, so I spoke with the chat. They gave me a number to call. This took over an hour to change my flight. Priceline had to call the airline directly. I could not call the airline directly, because Priceline ""possesed"" the tickets. Again, I received notification the flight had changed 2 days before my trip. It changed back to my original flight change of a 14 hour layover. I called them and it took another hour and a half on the phone for them to tell me that the flight in fact did not change. Currently, I have been on the phone for another 2 hours waiting. My flight was cancelled last minute. I finally got through to a Priceline agent after waiting 35 minutes in the que. She put me on hold to check on my flight and hung up on me. I called back. Waited another 25 minutes to speak to a representitive. He told me he could not help me because Priceline no longer had control of the tickets (it is past midnight the day of the flight). I asked to speak with his manager, due to the fact that I was hung up on. He put me back in a que. In the meantime, my husband called the airline. He put me on a callback waiting list. I received that phone call, before I could talk to a manager. Still waiting in the que!!! On top of it all, while I have been on hold all this time, I tried to speak with the chat representatives. They will not help you! They will only give you a scripted line and give you the phone number that will put you on hold. I asked to speak with their manager. I was never given a manager to speak with.        "	                1	1	Wednesday	priceline	negative

1743	            Rolled into Winston Salem to find that the hotel Priceline booked me at was overbooked. After 50 minutes on hold I finally got through, at 12:15am in the morning. After an hour they booked my across town. I took a taxi to find out Priceline made a verbal reservation, meaning they won't get paid, then called back and cancelled the reservation in an effort to push their Priceline reservation through. Someone else took the room. It was the last room in town and it was 2:30am. I was on a motorcycle in NC, rode from OH. I called them and back and at 2:30am Priceline told me to find my own room. I slept on a metal bench in front of hotel B. In the morning I took another cab back to hotel A where my motorcycle was. I was out a nights sleep and $60.00 in cab fares.        	                1	1	Tuesday	priceline	neutral

1746	            Hotel was in great proximity to tourist areas. Had somone with a keycard try to come into my room at 0620 and again at 0830.  The 2nd time they identified themselves as housekeeping, but I found it suspicious that housekeeping would be knocking at 0830, when check out was at noon. I alerted staff, who stated that she would alert housekeeping manager.   I told her that was a huge safety issue, and someone needed to follow up on it.

1747	            Each time I second guess Priceline. I keep coming back to priceline because no one can beat it!!!!! It is so simple to use. The customer service did me right, when a room I stayed at had a broken AC. They credited me quickly which I used for my next stay. Extremely friendly. I was talking to a customer service rep and asked me if I was driving. To be careful while taking the call. To me that actually means something! I was really surprised! I love Priceline!        	                1	5	Tuesday	priceline	positive
1748	            I've used Priceline many times to name my own price and have always had great luck.  It's becoming harder and harder to find the name your own price options, though.  Seems like they're pushing the express deals pretty heavily.  I have never booked an express deal, so I can't speak to that, but if you're naming your own price I highly recommend them.  If you plan on lowballing and working your way up, just be aware that you can only do that a certain number of times before they cut you off.  At that point, you have to wait two hours to try again.  It helps to have a few areas in mind you'd like to stay in and submit your bid for the first area, open it up to the second for your second bid and so on. I have consistently been able to get 4-star hotels at about half of what the median rate is (usually about 40% off the price of the hotel I end up with).        	                1	5	Tuesday	priceline	positive

1804	            Priceline has been amazing for finding great deals on hotels and car rentals during our travels. It's always nice reading reviews from other travelers before booking as well. Will definitely keep using the Priceline site when needing cars, hotels or flights.        	                1	5	Sunday	priceline	positive

1806	            I rented a car that I was supposed to pick up at like midnight. I pre-paid it.  I was to have the car for four days. I went to pick the car up at a later date and Priceline refused to give me the car, or my money, even though it was still in my paid rental period. That is theft to me.  Now I have to pay out of pocket for a ride to the airport although I paid for a rental car.  They did not advise me that if I picked up the car other than at the first possible opportunity that I would loose the whole rental.  That doesn’t even make sense.  I will never deal with them again.        	                2	1	Sunday	priceline	neutral

1812	            The hotel is great for people looking for a bargain. Bed is comfortable. Room is clean, carpets are worn out. Staff is friendly. The rooms are studio apartments and are pet friendly. Just like an apartment, guests are responsible for cleaning their own dishes. If you have more than one pet/ dog, you will pay more per night for your pets than you will for your room.        	                1	4	Sunday	priceline	positive

We had a large clean room with a great breakfast in the morning that served a variety of fresh food, (not rubbery eggs).  The hot tub and pool were also clean and refreshing.  This place was well run and well taken care of.  We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to others.        	                1	5	Saturday	priceline	positive

1826	            Although some airfares come with extra restrictions, if you are traveling alone and price is the most important factor, Priceline gets the best price and the airlines and hotels used are reputable.

1827	            I am going to be VERY clear here. I booked this hotel through Priceline and it false advertised in the photos that there was a working pool, they only mentioned minor construction and pool closures in a dropdown for policies that I had no reason to check.I got there and it was MAJOR construction.  It didn't look like a hotel from the street, it was covered in construction.I drove 6 hrs in the desert to have a very special time for my twins birthday present.  I saved my money and worked hard for this to be a great time.  When we arrived we were mortified.  It was torn to hell. We asked for a refund at check in and we were told since it's Priceline that your hotel could not provide one. I was told Marriott had no power to help me. Now I'm being told by your manager and Priceline that the hotel refuses to issue a refund and at the time of check in that they could have and I could have left this crap hole. Your people lied to me. I then had no place to park for registration so I said that I needed to park for the night and there were only handicapped parking which I am not allowed to park in. There were three people at the desk who all told me to park there overnight it didn't matter. I have contacted the Americans With Disabilities to investigate your property for this VIOLATION of human rights. Shame on you, and no I did not park in that spot.We got to the room, the room smelled,  the TVs didn't work and at 7:14 am when the construction started. The room was not renovated and did not look like any of the ones on Priceline. False advertising. I have asked your manager and Priceline has asked him for a refund.  He refuses. I am contacting the local city for an ordinance complaint as well as the tourism and city officials.  To make my stay worse, I got a nail in my tire from the construction.        	                1	1	Saturday	priceline	negative

1847	            I use online reservation services quite frequently and while Priceline offers some great rates you have to play around sometimes to maximize value, as an example I needed to book 2 rooms in Lisbon recently, but rather than book one time, it was better value to make two separate reservations, so save money but waste time? Disappointing when you're booking almost 200 room nights a year.        	                1	3	Friday	priceline	positive

The express purchase feature where you allow Priceline to pick a hotel for you has never failed me.  I ended up getting the room at the Waverly for only $62 a night when it is normally valued at $265.        	                1	5	Friday	priceline	positive
1858	            Almost perfect experience with booking the hotel room.  Booking information on priceline website said 2 guests with up to 2 children ages up to 19.  Therefore, although not explicitly specified, you would reasonably think there would be 2 beds in the room.  It turned out to be only 1 king size bed.  However, hotel staff changed the room right away without any hassle.  The process from booking to checkout was otherwise very pleasant!        	                1	4	Friday	priceline	positive

1953	            I have used Priceline for long time until recently a very unpleasant experience made me decide not to use it again. I booked a hotel through Priceline’s express deal which is said helped me saved 25%. But just half an hour later after I arrived the hotel I found actually Priceline charged me 30% more than the standard sales price the hotel offered. I am especially disappointed at Priceline’s customer service. They tried each way they can to find the excuses to tell me that they need earn money. Gaining a profit through cheating and providing misleading information on their website is what I realized that what Priceline has been doing. They charge unreasonable extra tax and commission (service fee) which makes their deal isn’t good at all.        	                1	1	Wednesday	priceline	negative

1956	            Priceline is my go to website for hotel accommodation and rental car.  I love the express deal and am mostly pleased with the selected hotel.  It can be a risk, but you might end up with a gem, like the Marriott in near Miami airport at a steep discount.  Prices are usually cheaper or comparable with other reservation sites; however, the quality of service that Priceline provides is unrivaled.        	                4	5	Wednesday	priceline	positive

1963	            Priceline has provided us reasonable rates for hotel, car rental and flights. They updated our flight gate changes before the airline sent a text. Downside is that the hotels don't always honor room booked and can't comp you because it is booked with Priceline and when it's late you don't want to call price line to try and assist.        	                1	5	Tuesday	priceline	negative

1993	            Priceline is a great online service for finding hotels and motels where I'm traveling. But may not be aware of underlying issues in the places advertised. And cancellation may not be possible when the hotel is below standard.        	                1	3	Tuesday	priceline	neutral

2018	            Reservation cancelled by Priceline was resolved but it was inconvenient to arrive late at night, tired and hungry and spend 30 min waiting for a solution.

2021	            I think the website is a good way to find good deals on hotel rooms. However, there are always so many hidden fees that the advertised price rarely reflects the actual price of the room you book.        	                1	4	Monday	priceline	positive

2024	            I felt that princeline was a ripe-off, we told that there are no discounts for disabled veterans,  and after I got to hotel to check-in I was told that I could not get a receipt of what was charged to my credit card because their was a third party involved. I called the 1-800-Holiday-Inn back and quesion why was I dealing with a third party, when I dealt called the Holiday Inn's 800 number, they could not give me a direct answer. All I know is that I gave my credit card info to a Hotel representative, which gave it to a third party without my consent, and now my info is being used without me haing any knowledge of how much I am being charged, or a receipt to should what I physically charged for my records.        	                1	1	Monday	priceline	positive

2031	            Be careful when booking hotels and condos.  I made a reservation for a 2 bedroom condo for 6 people but received an email saying the reservation is for a max of 2 people.  I went back through the checkout process with 6 people and it does not change the number until after you get the confirmation email with non-refundable reservation.  Classic bait and switch.  Chatted with customer service and they told me there is nothing they can do.

2042	            We stayed at this hotel for consulate interview in the ends of Aug. Thank god everything went well and fast we only stayed at the hotel for 1 week. But i would recommend the hotel it has a nice pool area you can order food from their kitchen. Very clean overall a decent gym and good service 24hrs a day.  Really appreciated their receptions Alberto he is bilingual and we're bugged him for food/eating out places loved it.They have a nice little laundry room highly recommend if you don't want to carry too many items with you and just wash. Good place to stay if you are bringing your children along but i would recommend taking them its such a drag for them poor things . They offer you courtesy transportation if need be too you're appointments but the driver does take his sweet time so you might be stuck waiting a bit longer. They give you a courtesy breakfast everyday but it's not very American  breakfast si options are the same and you get tired very quickly same breakfast nasty orange juice,  wish they had bacon, sausage , and better scrambled eggs. With that said i would still recommend staying here of i would have to stay here i would do it again!        	                1	4	Sunday	priceline	positive

2047	            Great location right downtown at the Intercontinental in Milwaukee.  Maria at the front desk was so personable and thoughtful, definitely the kind of person a hotel would want greeting the public.  The room layout was great with a sitting area separate from the sleeping area.  The only downside was the cleanliness and maintenance of the room.  A little paint on the doorframe and wiping of the woodwork in the bathroom and I would have given 5 stars.        	                1	4	Sunday	priceline	positive

2054	            In a world of customer service, and a world of travel, I have never dealt with a company that was as bad as priceline.com! I am a person who travels alot, love it! PRICELINE.COM made me had my last weekend trip. Booked a hotel and got directions from there website to the hotel, my phone directed me turn for turn to my destination in my state and stated it was 1 hour 48 min away. Got there where it said it was and it was in the middle of a residential street. Turns out it booked a hotel in a completely different state!!!! Gave me directions to a location in the city and state I was going but booked it 4 states away!!! Called and was told they would do nothing about it!! Horrible company and horrible people that work there. Talked to 5 different people, none off them had any problem taking my money and telling me there was nothing they could do. Plenty of other travel sites out there, use any but Priceline.com.        	                1	1	Sunday	priceline	negative
2055	            If there was a no star option I would rate priceline as that. Yesterday my boyfriend and I had an emergency trip to make across the state to see a dying family member in the hospital. Went to priceline and selected our state and city location. Columbia,mo we selected a hotel and confirmed the information dates and booked the hotel. Clicked the directions button on the Priceline website, the map took us to the correct city and gave a location of the hotel in missouri. When we got to the location on the priceline website, no hotel. Called priceline and they say that the reservation was made for south Carolina......really our side said missouri theirs says south Carolina. So the lady on the other end of the phone 'maria' says she can refund our money that night but therer would be a cancellation fee because the hotels manager wasn't there that night to approve the removal of the fee. She then directed us to call back in the morning because the hotels manager would be there at that time and would wave the fees and refund our money. We did as the priceline associate instructed and called back. The very rude man who answered informed me that the hotel was denying the refund because they said it wasn't their fault and that priceline needed to handle it because it was an error on their end. The man then informed me that their was nothing priceline could do and that they would not be refunding anything to us now, when a mear 9 hours before their associate said she would. I then asked to speak to a manager since I wasn't getting anywhere with him. 'Josh' then informed me that he 'was the ultimate authority' and refused to transfer me to anyone higher up in his company. He then tells me I have to speak to the hotel and get them to refund the money. After asking several times and being turned down i never got to speak to a manager. I call the hotel and they inform me that the money goes to priceline and that they have to be the ones to refund it because it was an error on Priceline end and that they can't refund money they haven't received yet. I hung up and called priceline back. I got a lady who wouldn't listen to a word I was saying when I kept asking to talk to a manager and kept over talking me and kept 'reviewing the previous associates notes' and kept repeating the conversation I had just had with Josh. I then informed her i know all of that information already and I then again ask to speak to a manager. After now dealing with this for more than 30 or 45 minutes. I finally get to a higher up in the chain who tells me the same story....Priceline wont refund the money because the hotel (which was not to blame) wouldn't refund it and priceline wont refund anything without the hotel approving it. I tell her the entire situation about what their associate told us the night before and she said nope they wont do anything for me. At this point I become very upset and she kept over talking me I tell her she isn't listening to me and ask why 9 hours ago I could have got a refund and now after listening to one of their associates I am being denied. They only thing I was offered was that she would escalate it to the next department and they would refund my only after it was reviewed and if they found that they were at fault. She then asked me the rudest question I have ever been asked. This so called manager of a million dollar company asked me 'if I was a lady or a man'? Honestly i have never been more offended in my life. Priceline now not only refused to help in a situation where they were at fault, but actually asked a very discriminatory question. This company is very lucky that they didn't do this to a lawyer or judge, they would be seeing an impending lawsuit if so . Needless to say when I book my European honeymoon I will not be using this disgraceful excuse of a company.        	                1	1	Sunday	priceline	negative

2063	            The only real problem with Priceline is making sure that an Express Deal will fit a families' needs.  If you don't follow up with the hotel [that you won a great deal with] they have no idea if you're showing up as a solo on a business trip or as a family on vacation.

Their customer service phone reps are useful only for booking. if you have questions or complaints, i was told by one of them that there was no phone number to call because ""they"" don't want to talk to people.  No problem!  May I suggest that you call Booking.com for any of your travel needs.        "	                1	1	Friday	priceline	negative
2076	            Update to review below: Because I'm a Marriott Rewards member, I called Marriott for assistance.  They said they could fix the problem if I could get Priceline on the phone.  Obviously, Priceline won't speak with the vendor to allow you to hear what is said, but luckily, the Priceline rep was willing to call my contact and get the date changed.  I upped the stars on my review, but still only went to three because I don't know if the next person would be so fortunate.  As a final point, I don't know whether it was Priceline's system that changed the date or Mapquest, which transferred the request to Priceline, but either way, you may not get the date you request, even if you are looking at it correctly before confirming.I believe Priceline's system is set up to scam potential customers.  This is second time where a reservation date was changed from what I selected.  Because of my first experience losing money on a date I didn't select, I was very careful the second time and got the same result: wrong date and no refund.  They say they can't re-book the date because the hotel won't let them; however, the hotels say that Priceline has total control because they prepay for the rooms and can cancel or re-book at will.  Total scam.  Never going to use them again!        	                1	3	Friday	priceline	negative

2082	            I paid $440 for a hotel and not knowing that it didn’t have free parking until I called the hotel. On top of that, the parking was not at the hotel! And I have two children. I wanted to see if they can change to a different hotel for me but they said they would have to charge $316 to cancel that hotel and I have to pay for another hotel. Yes, sounds reasonable. I asked them if Priceline was ok for a client to pay $440 for a hotel and not be happy with it and they said there’s nothing they can do. They is absolutely bad business and bad customer service.        	                1	1	Friday	priceline	negative
2083	            I booked a rental car with them and realized I needed an extra day a couple hours later.  Called customer service and they said that they couldn't change it and I would have to do it through Budget.  So then I called Budget and they said I had to add the day through Priceline.  I called Priceline again and they said that they couldn't add the day and I had to do it through Budget.  So I called Budget again and they said that Priceline is a booking agent for them and that only Priceline can change it because of the contract they have with them.  The crappy thing is that I had to extend my hotel stay too and Expedia got it changed for me without much of an issue so I know Priceline could have added another day!  I am trying to spend more money!!!!  I have read a ton of reviews that their  customer service is terrible if there are any problems.  Now I know it for myself.

2126	"            The insurance on the priceline is a HUGE LIE. When you booked the hotel, they gave you the option to purchase insurance saying ""free cancellation"", but that is a lie. Priceline told us they cannot modify our trip even though we purchased the insurance. The insurance company told us no trip can be cancelled unless it is life threatening, which is not it was advertised. Customer service was unhelpful - that's if you call someone repeating a million times ""I can't help you"" customer service. Bye bye Priceline.

2127	"            Recently we booked a hotel in South Africa through Priceline.  The day before our trip we received a confirmation of the booking from Priceline.  When we arrived (after a trip of 30+ hours) the hotel was dark.  No one answered the doorbell.  No one answered the phone.  We tried to call several times.  There was a big ""for sale"" sign out front.  We contacted Priceline and were told the booking was through Agoda, one of their ""partners,"" and therefore they could not/would not help us.  Two days later we received an e-mail from Agoda indicating that they had the right to charge us for ""failure to show.""  As of today we have not received any apology or other form of reaching out from Priceline.  I will never book with them again.        "	                1	1	Wednesday	priceline	negative
