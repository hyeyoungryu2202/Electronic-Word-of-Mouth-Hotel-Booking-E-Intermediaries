1	            They charged my card 4 days before they said they would.  I tried to call and was on hold for an hour, never got to speak to anyone.  Bad business.  Seriously upset, not to mention appalled.  Charging someones card before they promised is a crime.  I had no intention of paying with that card, only to reserve.        	                1	1	Monday	agoda	negative

19	            Hiccups happen and it's nice to speak with someone when that happens.  The listed number for Agoda on their website is 866-656-8207 which will place you on hold indefinitely.  Twice I waited on hold for nearly an hour before giving up.However, they have another number which someone answers right away and I found them quite helpful.  Try 929-270-4044 instead.        	                1	3	Friday	agoda	positive
20	            Disgusted - don't use themI've just arrived at a hotel for a 2 night stay only to find that Agoda have cancelled the booking - without informing me. Tried their customer service department (via an automated system) only to be told the booking was cancelled and to email if I wasn't happy.....Absolutely shocking and will never use them again. I'd also advise others to be wary.        	                1	1	Friday	agoda	negative

Pathetic thing is no one is calling or responding on the refund. at the time of booking they call 5 to 10 times to share card details. this is the most terrible service I have ever seen.

26	"            Site is confusing, selected correct dates from calendar, confirmation showed wrong dates, logged in to change dates, site said correct dates ""not available"", then i ""see"" their ""no cancellation"" policy, call their customer service #, on hold a long time; Agoda representative won't speak to me because reservation is in husband's name.  He's aged and sight/hearing impaired ... they used this excuse (I have to put him on the phone to cancel.) as their ""reason"" for keeping my $.  Agoda is the worst in site management, service, and a waste of time. I warn everyone - find another service that wants to be of service rather than waste your time and take you money for NO REASON but they're a rip off.

34	            Agoda advertised a room on their website that didn't exist at the hotel. Instead of a twin room i was being checked-in to a room with a bunk bed. When i contacted Agoda they said that i couldn't get my money back or change room because the hotel policy doesn't let you cancel the reservation on the day of arrival.. (this seems obvious to me, however how can i know that i'm getting checked in a bunk bed room). I've now been battling with Agoda to get my money back (i had to book another hotel for that same evening). Until now this resulted in 4 hours on the phone, 1 long chat session with their helpdesk and 2 emails and no solution yet. This is really the worst experience i've ever had.A simular case i had with booking.com was resolved within a 5 minutes phone call (full cashback without any issues).        	                1	1	Wednesday	agoda	negative

39	"            Dear Fellow Patrons of Agoda,I write this review in hopes to deter any of you from booking through this platform to save yourselves from the horrible experience we have gone through.After booking a room at Estadia Hotel through Agoda for 2 nights from 30Nov-2Dec 2018, we found a same room on booking.com, inclusive of breakfast, but at a much cheaper price. The gravity of their deception and adamant refusal to admit that we have indeed found a booking for the same room at a cheaper price with all the evidence against them should be a strong enough reason for me to turn your heads away from this site. However, I understand the need to paint a clear picture and cover both sides of the story. Hence, I have attached the 2 bookings since a picture is worth a thousand words, much less 2.Naturally, the first reaction upon finding a cheaper option, we tried to call Agoda. After waiting on the line for 2 whole hours 3 days in a row, our call was finally answered. (In between, we tried reaching out to Agoda via Facebook Message but it is evident that they have decided to ignore our case when they left us on read.) The nice lady on the other end of the line then instructed us to apply through the claim form on their website. After filling up the claim form multiple times, we were brick walled by the same reply multiple time, stating that the:-room size is different-bed type is different-provision of free breakfast is different-cancellation policy is different-provision of free bike rental and shuttle service is differentBy the 3rd rejection, we were well on our way to Malacca. Once there, we got the hotel to confirm the room types for both sites and have appended their letter in this review. 1.	Room Size is DifferentFrom Agoda: Please be advised that twin bed 2 single beds, city view, non-smoking, free wifi and the size of the room is 22 m2/237 ft2/ Please be informed that the Screenshot sent to is for the Estadia Deluxe Aside from the obvious deviation from a standard reply leading to a typo in the email, the room on booking.com is stated as a deluxe room while the room on Agoda is a twin bed room, upon inspection of the hotel website, it was evident that there is no twin bed room provided by the hotel which left us worried if we had been scammed. However, the hotel has stated that both the rooms are the same as stated in the letter. 2.	Bed Type is DifferentFrom Agoda: Please be advised that twin bed 2 single beds, city view, non-smoking, free wifi and the size of the room is 22 m^2/237 ft^2As with above, we requested for the hotel to join the 2 single beds in one of the room and left the other as it is to prove that it is indeed the same room. Regrettably, we did not take pictures of the room, however for those familiar with Malacca, we shall state for the purpose of fairness that the room was facing Jln Melaka Raya instead of the shopping centres on the other side of the hotel, city view or not, you decide 3.	Provision of Free Breakfast is DifferentFrom Agoda: Free Breakfast is providedAdmittedly, this point is different from booking.com since booking.com does provide breakfast while agoda does not. However, on this premise, it infuriates us that the staff of agoda dared to bring this point up, as if we are expected to pay more because something is not provided.4.	Cancellation Policy is DifferentFrom Agoda: Same Cancellation and Amendment policiesBooking.com allows for free cancellation while agoda does not. As with above, this point is different, but expecting us to pay more for a service that you did not provide has, at this point in time, become a classic for agoda5.       Provision of Free Bike Rental and Shuttle Service is DifferentFrom Agoda: Please know that your confirmed agoda booking includes free shuttle service and bike rental. While the rates you foundon other website does not. Aside from the obvious deviation from a standard reply leading to a typo in the email, the hotel has confirmed that free shuttle service and bicycle rentals are provided to all guests upon request. Estadia Hotel is a wonderful hotel in Malacca strategically situated between the malls and street food. With warm staff and sheltered linkways between the malls. This hotel has been a go-to for my family since its completion a few years ago and I would highly recommend any visitors of Malacca to have a try. I understand that social media is a double-edged sword and naturally posting this would put me at a risk of being “flamed”, hence I leave it to all of you to be the judge and I hope that this review has helped you to think twice about booking through agoda.

After many many emails to and from them they absolutely refuse to change the booking (in the same hotel) even though we have called the hotel to see if they have accommodation for the new night and they do.

56	            I have now realised that i will not be using Agoda again after using it for several years due to the following:1) you will not be able to talk to the personnel handling queries by call. I have benn calling about 10 times a day foe several days and each call i have waited even for 30 min, and yet they never take the call2) the cancellation option is not quite misleading. Though you have chosen to book with no cancellation fee if you cancel before a certain date, when you click on the cancellation button, the condition will be stated as no refund of your payment. Hence the option to cancel without cancellation fee is not true.if you dont believe me, you will face the same frustration .        	                1	2	Monday	agoda	negative

69	"            This was the third and last time I ever book with Agoda. I had an issue with my Agoda booking in Tokyo Japan. We were not able to stay in the apartment we booked because it was so dirty it was totally unacceptable by normal standards to stay there. We had to book another place last minute which cost us double the money. I've had issues like this before but I've dealt with Booking.com and Hotels.com and they've always have found a way to help us out in situations like this by either giving us our full refund which we would in return use asap to book another place on the spot or even part of a refund. All we got from Agoda was vague emails through out our complaint process. Agoda's resolution to our problem was to give us $42.03 on a Agoda ""Gift Card"" which had to be used within 3 months. We just came back from Vacation. How am I going to plan another trip within 3 months. Horrible just horrible BUT you live and you learn!        "	                1	1	Saturday	agoda	negative

I notice every time I try, the price keep changing and the last attempt was successful BUT I didn't get the lowest price as before (when payment failed) and there is no option anymore to add in the coupon voucher (10%).

90	            My booking is still months away, so I can't speak to the end of the process, but trying to contact their customer service is absolutely pointless. I am trying to add a day to my stay and I sat on hold for 20 minutes before giving up and trying again 4 different times trying different menu options, but nothing worked. I tried calling the hotel directly, but there is nothing they can do on their end. I might cancel my booking and try using another site, even though it might cost a little more.        	                1	1	Tuesday	agoda	neutral
91	            Terrible - booked hotel, held charge on credit card, then sent an email stating that due to a systems error the booking could not be made, asking me to book again through their site.  When I checked back, the price had increased by over $100 per night.  If you can't honour the rates you publish, don't publish them. Very dodgy        	                1	1	Tuesday	agoda	negative

98	            The price in the confirmation email wasn't what I was charged - it showed £586.44, and then the actual payment which was taken a couple of weeks later was £35 more at a total of £621.89. I was told this is because of the currency conversion from Euros to Pounds but nowhere was I told that it would be re-converted. This is really misleading and should be made extremely clear. I would have cancelled my booking and found a different website to book through, but it was too close to the date of travel and was not worth the added headache. For that reason I would not use Agoda again.        	                2	1	Monday	agoda	negative

102	            Booked Holiday taxi from discovery holidays from agoda from BKK airport to siam kempinski. Upon arrival we waited for almost an hour before the driver showed up. We approach the tour counter which displayed our name for the pick up. The lady at the counter was not helpful at all. She just kept asking us to wait. Till we decided to get our own taxi and asked her to acknowledged on our booking letter that the driver didn't turn up then she took more proactive steps to call the driver. We wanted much of 6 persons time standing there waiting. Thought that we booked the transport prior to arrival will save us time, but we were wrong. What a start to our holiday in BKK!!! Will NOT book any transportation from this vendor anymore.        	                1	1	Monday	agoda	positive

105	"            Misleading pricing. The ""book now, pay later"" is a total scam. They trick you into booking by showing cheaper prices, but then when they do charge your card a couple days later, they charge a higher amount. When asked, they say it's because of the exchange rate. But the exchange rate is the same as when you booked. When asked what exchange rate they use, they say they don't know. And it's much higher than the visa exhange rate, or mastercard, or the european bank. So they just basically rob some money off you.Might not be the case with the bookings where you pay on the spot. Either way, not booking through them again as they seem completely untrustworthy.        "	                1	1	Sunday	agoda	negative

112	            I’ve booked though agoda for the very first time. Was a bit hesitant about this company. But I did anyway. No confirmation was received. So I have no booking reference. When calling their 24/7 website it ask for booking confirmation number. I don’t have one, so impossible to chat. I send a few email but only  reply was Hello, Thanks for getting in touch with us. We'll get back to you quickly..Checked my credit card - they have charged me for the booking. I’m not sure if  Hotel has been booked or not. For that reason I’m giving Agoda zero star.

144	            We were given a smoking room even though we had booked a non-smoking room. The view would be a city view, but instead we had a view of a neighboring house a few meters away. We tried to change but got to the conclusion that it was fully booked. Only day after we got another smaller room, which was cheaper per day. We have requested a refund for the first day without results. Agoda who does not have Swedish customer service refuses to refund. They mean we agreed to stay in the smoking room and therefore can not get the money back. It's like a bad joke. We had traveled all day and were tired.

Once he/she pickup the call, they will ask you to hold for 2 min and then they never responde and later disconnect the call after 15 or 20 min. These i faced 3 days continuesly. Further, Agoda can only provide you the booking confirmation but that doesn’t mean your booking is confirmed. I have faced few incidents wherein after I made booking and payments with Agoda, hotel rejected on check-in day that their all rooms are sold out and that time you will not have any choice to go with their ( Hotel Guy ) options.

I would just book nrw dates without waiting for US operator to talk to me like a robot. That's not a penalty it's just losing the booking.Agoda: that's correct.Me: thanks for your help.Agoda: the woman hung up. No sorry, no good bye, no have a good day.

186	            Agoda's customer service is abysmal.  I tried to call them to change a reservation which required them to contact the hotel.  The first time, it took 15 minutes to answer, then they listened to my request.  I was then put on hold while they contacted the hotel.  No response and call was hung up.  Tried again, and this time no answer in 20 minutes.  Called hotel, got through immediately, and they said agoda has to call, which they had not. So not only unresponsive, they are totally ineffective. Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever encountered.  I will not use Agoda anymore.  That after 8 years and many reservations.

200	            Honestly, if there is an option not to press any star, I won’t.  Agoda don’t deserved it.  During our holiday in Philippines, most of our hotel bookings made by Agoda.com, but shame on them charging me an Imperial room in Royal garden hotel in Ozamiz City Philippines. I sent them an email, complaining that I haven’t booked that imperial room and they showed me a booking referrence which I don’t receive an email from my side, of course if i have that confirmatiin i have all the right to cancel or to retain it.  You will be shocked and its already deducted to your debit card of £247.00. I try to call customer service nit helpful at all, talk to hotel in charge but they will just forward you to different people (not the right one). I been sending several emails to customerservice@agoda and the hotel itself, but non of them like to entertain you or help about your problem made by them. What a scam at agoda.com and the hotel.That amount of money that they took from me I would rather help to my nephew who is suffering from brain tumor and need more of financial support.What an aweful Agoda.com        	                2	1	Monday	agoda	negative

205	"            Avoid AGODA like the plagueI hate to spend any more time on this, but I feel like I owe it to other travelers to know what they’re dealing with.We booked a resort in Thailand  over the holidays earlier than usual through AGODA knowing it is peak travel season (and in fact it wound being the last room available).... and almost immediately received a notice that AGODA had charged our credit card almost $4,000 twice.After we called attention to the second charge, weeks went by with no response from AGODA despite repeated calls and emails so we contacted American Express who suggested we simply dispute the second charge.Almost instantaneously, we received a notice saying that our attempt to dispute this charge will result in cancellation of our reservation so we leapt into action contacting AGODA and the resort to say it was not our intention to cancel.... only that we had been charged twice per American Express and were disputing the second charge.What followed included...	⁃	Repeated denials by AGODA that the card was charged twice	⁃	Refusal by AGODA to contact American Express as instructed by Amex to confirm the second charge 	⁃	Unhelpful and flat-out accusatory “customer service”... when you can actually speak to a live person that is	⁃	Over $250 in international calls due to 30 minute wait times calling Agoda’s UK customer service # that no one ever picks up as well as calls to the resort and American Express	⁃	The cancellation of our reservation by AGODA despite over a dozen attempts to avoid this in writing and over the phoneTo add insult to injury, after AGODA finally acknowledged the error was theirs and that our cars had been charged twice AGODA’s “solution” was a $150 discount next time we use their terrible service which will never happen again.Unbelievable.  Unacceptable.  And here we are almost three months after our card was charged twice and still no refund.We travel more than anyone else we know and have never experienced anything even close to this.

208	            To all the travellers, holiday makers and sun seekers, please take the time to read my recent experience in October 2018. I would advise against using Agoda to book hotels. Agoda and Booking.com are owned by the same company. I booked a hotel and paid in full months prior to flying to my destination. I arrived in Istanbul at the 5 star hotel I had booked and the hotel told me that they require an extra £640 if I wished to stay. As I had already paid Agoda in full. I tried to contact Agoda but could not. It was very late and a was very tired after a long flight. I had to find somewhere very quick in a city that I was unfamiliar with. It was very scary and dangerous wandering through back streets in the dark. I was concerned for my personal safety. One blessing was that I was travelling alone and did not have children or family with me. I found a hotel after wandering around the streets with my all of my baggage. It was past midnight. When I awoke in the morning I found that Agoda had emailed me asking what had happened. I emailed them back advising them what had happened. They responded by stating that if I sent them the receipt for the new hotel that I was staying at they would reimburse me. I sent the receipt over a month ago, they have still not reimbursed me and are ignoring my emails. I have had to get my credit card company to help and try to get the money back that I paid them. If you’re going on holiday whether you are a family with children, a romantic getaway for couples or travelling alone, please be wary of this company        	                2	1	Saturday	agoda	positive

210	            Professional at dropping the ball. The first time I used them there was an error and after a long wait on the phone they offered to send a coupon; no coupon ever showed up. Fast forward a few months and I decide to give them a second chance. I booked a room on their app, Agoda billed my credit card but I never recieved a confirmation. After several email exchanges they cannot figure it out and they ask me to call them. Well two problems with this; I don’t have a phone plan for the country I am in, and I don’t enjoy spending my time traveling on hold. So, I had to go to show up to the hotel that I think I booked inland hope I have a room.        	                1	1	Saturday	agoda	positive

On arrival at the Hotel I was informed that payment had not been received by them and had to pay once again for my reservation.  This is not how a relaxing break should start!!  The hotel staff were very helpful in trying to resolve the problem but it is embarrassing having to prove you have already made payment for your stay in full view of everyone at reception.        	                1	1	Friday	agoda	negative

However, if you need to shorten your stay you WILL NOT be reimbursed the difference. They say this is part of their cancellation and change policy which doesn't actually say anything about changes. Customer Service is condescending and rude. They keep referring you to their policy and even offer to highlight it for you. I'm done.        "	                1	1	Friday	agoda	neutral

Do not trust this service.I reserved a hotel in New York City through Agoda. I received an email saying I would receive an email confirmation in 10 minutes. I did not.I never received a confirmation email confirming the booking (yes, I checked ""spam drain' to be sure). However, Agoda DID charge my credit card for the booking, more than 700.00 US.I emailed them several times (there is no phone number to call) and got a automatic email saying they'd get back to me right away. They did not.My hotel booking was for the next day. Since Agoda had charged my credit card, I assumed the booking was valid. I arrived at the hotel and the hotel had not received any booking from Agoda. I had to book with the hotel, another 700.00+ charge. Agoda got back to me 3 days later with an absolutely unhelpful email. It's like their email correspondence is written by a robot or a computer. It is not communicative in any way. I am still fighting these charges. Do not use this service under any circumstances.        "	                1	1	Friday	agoda	negative

I will now never book with them again due to a recent booking they made an error with, resulting in me arriving at a hotel to be told the booking hadn’t been confirmed to them and the room booked was unavailable. Fortunately at this late time I was able to book an alternative inferior room directly with the hotel but this was substandard and spoilt the end part of my holiday. I contacted Agoda who rather insultingly have offered a $20 credit against a future booking which must be used within 3 months. After pleading on several emails I have now rejected this very insulting offer as a matter of principle and will never book with Agoda again!! They obviously don’t care about loyal customers. I shall book with their competitors in future.        	                2	1	Monday	agoda	neutral

Agoda simply said their terms and conditions do not guarantee anything and it is up to you as the customer to check, Put simply it is pure chance if your request is acted on and they are not proactive at all.

251	            Usually, as Canadian I prefer Agoda before Expedia because usually the hotels are cheaper. Nevertheless, I figured that Agoda is one of the rare agency not telling us that there are resort fees to be added (mostly in Las Vegas ...).Ex: Circus Circus Hotel, if you want a really good deal then you choose the days of the week and you select NO REFUNDABLE. After, you will get the bill from Circus Circus with the great deal ex: 3 nights at $20 each plus resort fees of $37/night. With Agoda, you accepted to pay 3 X $ 20 plus the normal taxes. Never Agoda will mention the resort fees. Surprise!  $110 as extra to pay for a reservation that you can't cancel..  . Agoda is used by fraudulent businesses and does nothing to tell us that you will get extra charges from criminals.        	                5	2	Sunday	agoda	neutral

283	            AGODA is absolutely disgusting. Poor customer service. Promised to refund for a hotel but then said no. I have lost £420 in a hotel we couldn't stay in. Please do not book through Agoda. You will be very disappointed.  I have made a formal complaint to the highest complaint agency here in the UK.

284	            Truly disappointing Agoda experience! Manipulated reviews! Poor customer service!I have reserved 2 rooms at a hotel Hotel du Havre in Paris suggested by agoda 7/10 reviews, and fairly okey reviews on the page. When I got to hotel what I saw was absolutely not what I saw online. The room was old and dirty, bed sheets have not been changed, and if they have been changed, they haven't been washed, there were stains all over them. There were hairs in the bathroom floor and bathtub, mold all over the bathroom and the room, smell of bed bugs repellent, blood stains on the walls, carpets, blankets and mattress. The grosest experience I've ever had in a hotel. Immediately I contacted customer service and I was told that the hotel has no cancellation policy but if I send a proof that room is not to standard agoda will probably refund me. I took pictures of the hotel and sent them over to agoda.  After I sent images I received an e-mail saying that agoda contacted the hotel and HOTEL SAID THAT ROOM WAS CLEAN!!! That's the most ridiculous thing I've heard because I was at that room (2 rooms in fact because I booked 2 rooms, and they were both gross!). I took and sent pictures proving that the rooms were dirty. In the meanwhile I checked out because it was too gross to stay the night and made a last minute reservation at another hotel.Oh, and on top of that the hotel staff were the rudest people I met in Paris on that trip. They even charged me city tax upon check in and refused to pay it back even though I didn't spend a night there.A few days later I received an e-mail from Mara at agoda repeating the same thing that hotel has no cancellation policy and asking if she could call and I replied with my phone number but never heard back either. Since then I sent a few e-mails and haven't received any feedback from anyone at agoda. I also did try to post a review about my experience on agoda.com for Hotel du Havre but review has not even been published!!!!  And here I wonder why, because I'm sure there will be more guests like myself who would book it based on reviews that do not represent the reality. At this point I realise that agoda has provided information that was not fully representing the condition of hotel I was booking and is refusing any responsibility. I have used agoda a few times and I am not a fussy traveler, I can handle a lot of things. But that hotel was absolutely gross and nobody should stay there. I am truly disappointed with the whole experience from booking till early check out and how agoda handled my complaint and the poor customer service. In the future I will certainly look for another way of making hotel bookings.        	                1	1	Wednesday	agoda	negative

301	            This company obviously has security issues. My account has been hacked and I had two bookings I didn't make that were charged to my credit card. They did cancel my booking and have it refunded to my card after I raised the complaint. However, I am not able to delete my account. My attempt to change the password did not work. I had to cancel my credit card with my bank as a result. Today, I have a fraudulent booking using my rewards point. After I called and complained again, they decided it's ok to cancel my account but it's still not processed. In the meanwhile the hacker is making a new booking again. I wasted my whole Saturday on the phone with them and the problem is still not resolved. It's unbelievable  they do not freeze and cancel my account right away. Do not use agoda, it's not worth it!        	                5	1	Saturday	agoda	negative

Upon arrival the hotel refuse the booking claiming it wasn't paid. Even after showing the receipt and paid conformation the hotel still insisted it wasn't paid. Needless to say the Booking was paid in full and it showed on the bank statement that the money was taken out. The entire team ( 5 people ) had to go and find 3 rooms at 10pm that night and Agoda is still unreachable ! NEVER USE THIS SERVICE.

340	            DO NOT USEWith Agoda I've experienced the worst customer service ever.I booked an hotel through them and after few hours they informed me that it was fully booked. They offered an alternative accomodation but they never followed up. I was left waiting for their emails to receive instructions about the method of payment and info about the new accomodation. I got three replies, all of them from a different customer service agent with no clue about what was going on. Ten days before my departure I had no accomodation, I had to book a new one with very limited choice left especially in term of price. Thankfully my payment had to be taken 48 hours before the arrival. I would not trust them with my money and at this point, after waiting 24 hours for a reply that never arrived, I genuinely think it is a scam.If something goes wrong with your booking there is very little chance they will be able to deal with it in a decent way.        	                1	1	Monday	agoda	negative

352	            Made a booking for a double room in Tokyo with agoda as the hotel's website doesn't work. Had booked this hotel with agoda previously with no issue, however this time around, despite paying the going rate for a double room in full 2 months in advance, on check in the hotel claimed that I booked a semi-double room. Managed to get through to Agoda the first time I called but was put on a lengthy hold only to be told that they need more time in order to negotiate with their supplier. Then they eventually told me that the hotel refused to honour the booking but can give me the ordered room if I topped up, and agoda will refund the unspecified difference with receipt... checked with the hotel and guess what? There were no double rooms available! The next room type up is a twin, and the difference is more than $100usd a night, much more than I am prepared to pay and not get reimbursed by agoda for. I already paid almost $200usd per night for what was advertised as a double room which was the fair going rate, certainly not a discounted price. I tried to call agoda again but this time I was immediately put on hold for more than 20 mins. Having lost more than an hour already I gave up and checked into the smaller room, advising agoda that I will be requesting a chargeback if they do nor refund me. An hour later agoda replies saying that since the room is not available their supplier would refund me the difference, but this itself is a joke, because the difference they quoted was way less than the actual difference which they had offered to pay before. We should have realised that something was up with agoda. The previous property we stayed at was actually overbooked, but luckily the hotel eventually managed to make arrangements for us so we didn't have to sleep on the streets on our holiday.TLDR: if you want to make sure you get the hotel room you've paid for and not waste your life arguing to try to get it or to get a refund (not talking about any fair compensation for your holiday wasted), don't use agoda. Their customer service is spotty at best, and non-existent at worst.        	                2	1	Saturday	agoda	positive

362	            This company is sneaky.  I searched for a hotel close to the house of blues, and found one less than 2 miles away with free cancellation.

364	            I was charged for a hotel room booking with the twice more expensive price than it was shown in the hotel room description. In the cancel situation, the money was not refundable. Therefore, I ask Agoda team what can I do in this situation. I wondered can I somehow cancel with a refund because I've booked the hotel room by mistake. But Agoda team straightforward cancelled my booking without any discussion. I spent almost 400 dollars with this wrong booking and, moreover, because of Agoda team lost this booking. I was offered with the gift card with a refund in a form of Agoda Gift Card with the full booking value amounting of USD 398.11. Theoretically,  this solution would suit me. I would have the opportunity to make more than one bookings on Agoda for three months period.  Despite this fact, I have not received it. The amount of the gift cards in my Agoda account is still 0. Agoda closed my issue and do not respond to my messages.        	                1	1	Thursday	agoda	positive
365	            Booked a stay in South Africa at a safari lodge, so the initial outlay was quite large. On all correspondence it said the total cost would be xxxZAR at the exchange rate on the day of payment. The GBP&gt;ZAR exchange rate was around 16.5 during time of booking - 04/18The GBP&gt;ZAR exchange rate was 18.7 at the time of payment. Therefore the exchange rate was 11.3% in my favour, or so you would assume.Upon calling Agoda to change my card details, they advised that I would need to pay in full now - not a problem. Then I was told that I would need to pay £400 more than it should have been at today's exchange rate. When questioning this I was told it was due to Agoda's 'own exchange rate'. Working this out, it would be a GBR&gt;ZAR value of 15 (it hasn't been that low in 5 years).Upon complaining I was told that they would 'honor' the booking at the 'original' rate - as it was in April. Therefore costing me 11% which on a booking of this size was less than acceptable. On all correspondence it was quoted as xxxZAR, with no GBP prices.Beware that if the exchange rate goes in your favour, they will charge you more.        	                2	2	Thursday	agoda	positive

371	"            How I lost 31 thousand rublesI cannot say that the employees of this company (Agoda) are fraudsters. I am not a lawyer. But the booking technology in some cases, for example, booking for special offers is built so that pushes for an error.Gentlemen! Be wary of special offers from Agoda! The booking technology is such that at the last stage you will not see either the date or the amount you have to pay.As a result, do not pay for what you have planned.This situation is particularly piqued by the fact that, it turns out, you cannot cancel your reservation! Although on the previous pages it says ""free cancellation.""My story:I booked a room from January 8 to January 9, 2019! I entered these dates on the site!On the booking page were the dates January 8, January 9, 2019, which I entered.On the same page it says “free cancellation!”But in the final form when the payment was not specified dates. That is, I could not check the correctness of the reservation!I clicked on the “Book” button, and only after that there appeared an inscription that I had successfully booked a room for 7 days in December! And the amount of 31 thousand instead of 4400 rubles.I rushed to cancel the reservation. Canceled instantly, but did not return the money. It turns out this reservation is irrevocable! I wrote several letters to the addresses of this company. I didn’t receive any answers - the letters are obviously not received by people, there are automatic machines there. That is to clarify the misunderstanding is impossible! I wrote to the hotel. They replied that they did not know - the reservation went through Agoda. The hotel, of course, nothing to do with.""Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes""        "	                1	2	Wednesday	agoda	positive

374	            Terrible experience with Agoda. To cut a long story short (admitted) technical difficulties with their website resulted in me having reservations for the same hotel twice.What happened next was farcical. It was impossible to cancel the booking on the website without being charged for the night.I tried to call the call centre. It took a long time to speak to someone. They refused to refund me, saying they would have to get in touch with the hotel.I then received a call from Hong Kong, at 2355 (slightly unsociable, some might think). They claimed the hotel was refusing to refund me, but they would offer credit in the form of Agoda vouchers as a sight of 'goodwill'. The call operative spoke poor English, and failed to understand why the offer of vouchers (in circumstances where technical difficulties with their website had caused the problem in the first place) was unacceptable.In the end, I had to solve the problem with the hotel directly. The manager at the hotel was very pleasant. He said he was always happy to refund the money (which rather makes me think that Agoda was trying to capitalise on their error for financial gain). I won't be using Agoda again.        	                1	1	Tuesday	agoda	negative
375	            I booked through Agoda for a trip to Edinburgh.There was an error with the website, and the dates booked were not the ones I entered onto the website initially.I cancelled the booking within a few hours and made a fresh reservation for the correct dates, although my preferred hotel was not available at this time.I expect a refund would be processed, however no refund hit my account. A month later, I contacted the customer services and they said they were unable to honour a refund as the hotel had a no refund policy. Would recommend using any other alternative travel agent or website if possible.        	                2	1	Tuesday	agoda	neutral

377	"            I have tried to book a hotel on this site, and they applied lots of pressure that it was the ""last room"" available. I went through the process and filled out all of my details including my credit card, moved on to confirm. Yet was told the room had been booked by somebody else. Despite the room being no longer available, the website suggested I ""try to book another type of room"". I went back to the hotel page and the same room is still there at at a 20% higher price! And it's still the ""last room available""...So I assume their system has increased the prices during my check-out process. Really shady business model.

386	            I cancelled my booking for accommodation on 19/06/2018 as I was called for surgery to remove a large uterine tumour through the public hospital system which affected my ability to work as a wedding makeup artist so I needed to cancel my accommodation which was booked to tend to a long distance wedding client which I had paid for in advance using my credit card. I cancelled the booking on 19/06/2018 which is more than 31 days required notice from the booking date of the accommodation (which was for 28/07/2018) as specified by AGODA in their cancellation terms of service so I am entitled to a refund less the credit card fee they took. I received confirmation of cancellation via email on 19/06/2018 which states that I will pay nothing for this cancellation and that the amount will be refunded to my credit card (which it has not). The email states a waiting/processing period of 15-30 days or the next billing cycle which I waited out and never received the refund so I followed up again via email on 31/07/2018 which they replied apologising for delay and stated that the refund usually takes 7-10 business days to process and that my complaint was escalated to a higher support team. Still without refund, I contacted AGODA again on 23/08/2018 and received yet another written apology stating that they have escalated my concern to a higher department. I received an email on 24/08/2018 with a refund reference number and that I need to contact the bank to trace the refund. I did this and have checked allowing generous time frames for the refund to be processed but there is no refund from AGODA in my account. I emailed AGODA again and received a reply 31/08/2018 stating that I need to contact my bank as they can locate my refund. There has been no refund. This business is misleading and an absolute rip off. They have not fulfilled their refund terms which they promised. So misleading and dishonest!

387	            Super dishonest! Ive now had 3 issues with Agoda1) booked hotel in Mexico. Hotel falsely advertised on Agoda. Hotel gave back money for remaining nights and canceled booking to keep rating- no record.2) My father nearly died and family had to naturally tend to him and cancel a trip in Asia in advance. Despite regulations and refund policy, Agoda has never issued any refund. My poor mother is very old and customer service keeps changing ticket ID so have to keep starting over- keep passing buck from one team to another- using very dubious tactics to confuse and never pay up.3) I had technical issue with a booking and hotel. Agoda and hotel both agreed and I called 3 times tot confirm I wouldnt be charged. Low and behold I just received a notice that I will be charged for the stay.Conclusion: its like a gambling site. Looks good but the house always wins and you end up with nothing!        	                9	1	Sunday	agoda	positive

Even thought the host gave you a key to get in...Now technical difficulties are understandable... It could of been a mixup I get that.... however when they book you into another apartment, it should be the same size and rooms right? No. No that's not what you deserve..  you are gonna get one less bed and have your brother or friend sleep on the floor. Yep and wheres the compensation???? No where to be found. Trust me.

The company was probably busy taking people's money while waiting to contact the hotel. SCAMMERS! CAPITALISTS!        	                1	1	Monday	agoda	neutral

They falsely sold me breakfast as a service, they charged me for it and all I got was a poor response offering no compensation or anything.Do not trust this company!

441	            Worst service ever, truly the least trustworthy hotel booking site I have ever. Making a reservation for Furama Riverfront Hotel in Singapore, three months ahead, for my family of five, clearly stating ages of the kids etc, I ended up paying for a room said to have a capacity for 3 adults and 2 children. However, immediately after paying for the reservation, with non-refund policy, the hotel lets me know this room is most likely too small, it only has 2 beds (1 single, 1 double)  they are not able to provide any extra bedding (although 32 m2 is advertised as the size of the room)  Now, given the feedback from the hotel, this room is clearly not suited for 3+2 persons, making the information given by Agoda clearly misleading. However, Agoda still refer to the non-refunding policy and refuse to offer a payback, even though this request is made within 48 hrs of the booking, 3 months ahead of the booked dates. If Agoda is to make customers trust their service, they need to provide the opportunity to change or cancel, when conditions are not correctly described. Especially within reasonable time (in this case 48 hrs) from the time of the reservation. Never trust Agoda!        	                3	1	Saturday	agoda	positive

450	            Terrible Terrible service. All is fine through the booking process but if you need to contact them after then it is a nightmare. We were overcharged at one accommodation as the hotel refused to honour the Agoda price and charged us the booking.com price. Agoda are now refusing to repay the difference. Also we were charged for one nights accommodation at a hotel that was closed due to flooding and again they are not refunding us. I can’t get through on the customer service number as it is a past booking and it is just generic emails they reply with every time. We will never be using this company again and I would not recommend using them as if you have any problems after, then it is so much hassle.        	                2	1	Friday	agoda	negative

470	"            Really poor customer service! Will not use again! We've used a fair share of hotel booking websites and so far, Agoda has given us the worst experience ever. I made a booking through their cellphone app in early Sept, and for a first, we never got any email confirmations nor can we find the booking on the app. We then emailed the Agoda customer service but NEVER gotten responses whatsoever. We sent multiple emails to them but NO ONE EVER RESPONDS. We emailed the hotel directly to find out whether the booking exists or not, and it does exist, but we already have another booking secured right now, and the hotel was not able to process the refund and that we'd need to contact Agoda for the full refund. SO we emailed Agoda again, but no still response. So we called the toll free line, for some stupid stubborn reason, they will not let the line go through unless we have a booking ID, BUT THE THING IS, WE NEVER GOTTEN ANY BOOKING ID'S, HOW THE F CAN WE GIVE IT TO THEM. What's worst is that this isn't the first time they messed up, last time we got a confirmation, but the hotel did not receive our booking and we had no idea until we were about to check in. All they did to ""help"" was give us a 5% off voucher. Had such a hard time trying to contact them, poor reception at the hotel tried so many numbers. Not only they are IMPOSSIBLE to contact, but they also have a horrible attitude towards customers. We've given enough chances to them, will never use again. We are just going to stick with other reliable websites.        "	                1	1	Tuesday	agoda	negative
471	            this has been one of the worst experiences. They advertised a hotel on their website but hid the section relating to the fact that if you check in after 7PM you will be charged an additional fee of €30. This I could accept as I should have clicked all of the drop down links. However, I can't accept that they do not disclose that you cannot check in at all after a certain time (11PM). Now I am surely not going to be able to use the property at all and am trying to get through to their customer services which has taken 20 mins and counting so far.

When I had an extremely high amount come out of my account after messaging them for 3 hours and threatening legal action on them they stated they calculate the cost of the reservation and convert it to USD then reconvert it on the day using USD again on the day payment is due so instead of costing me $1500 that was expected it cost me $1950 AUD and they think that’s fair I will never use them again and strongly warn anyone else not to fall for their deceitful practice        	                1	1	Tuesday	agoda	neutral

516	            I booked hotel while traveling on a PC, they would not send confirmation booking till I uploaded photo ID and picture of credit card, of course I can't take pictures on PC. So they would not confirm booking but if you cancel its 280 dollars. Customer service dropped service after 30 minute wait! So no booking but can't cancel or they will charge credit card, nightmare BOOKING number 22897935        	                1	1	Thursday	agoda	negative
517	            Fine for booking but that is all. After that, if you want to contact Agoda there is absolutely no customer service and no one from Agoda wants to know. Despite several urgent emails on a worrying issue, no one bothered to reply or phone me. Trying to phone the customer service phone number on numerous occasions at different times and different days, no one picks up the phone. I will never ever use Agoda. I found the after sale service absolutely non existent and most frustrating.        	                2	1	Wednesday	agoda	negative

519	            SCAMMERSBooked a hotel with Agoda and when we arrived it was nothing like the photos. The room was disgusting, hairs everywhere, toilet seat completely broken, pungent smell in the room and dead insects.I informed Agoda of these appalling conditions and sent them photographic evidence. We requested a full refund and I was given the run around for days. They finally contacted me offering a voucher of $50 when I paid just over $60 which I refused as I didn't want to book anything else with them. I told them this to which they sent me a voucher for $40. I can see that neither logic nor customer care is among their top priorities. It appears that they have absolutely no shame.        	                11	1	Wednesday	agoda	negative
520	"            Disappointing experience. The price they give you per night is not the price you pay. Advertising low room rates per night attracts your attention only to find that local taxes and a ""service charge"" gets added in the payment process. Frankly, this brought the price up to whatever others were offering. Con. I hope they fail.        "	                1	1	Wednesday	agoda	negative

528	"            I have been a frequent user of Agoda for my travel bookings for about 2y, without any issues. However, recently I had a totally unacceptable episode and I will not be using nor recommend Agoda to anyone anymore.I made a booking for which I should have paid ~$690, but later I noticed on my credit card statement that I had actually been charged more than $800. When I flagged this, I was told that this was because I had been charged a ""destination fee"" of $115 - which was not mentioned anywhere in my booking. I kept complaining and finally Agoda checked with the hotel and agreed that such fee should not have been charged, and that they would refund it to me.I think the episode it's really unacceptable and it raises serious questions - why are they allowed to take more money from my card than they should have? I never allowed or agreed to be charged $805 - how does that work in terms of security? Moreover, given that I don't check my credit card statements so often, they might as well have done the same thing other times in the past without me noticing, and now I have to go through 2 years of statements to double-check of that.Finally, in dealing with this, I would have expected a big apology and an immediate refund. Instead, after 2 weeks I have not received anything and when I asked again (because you have to ask yourself and chase them regularly, otherwise they just sit and wait), I was told I need to provide a bank statement (they can't even check how much money they have taken themselves??). So I am now waiting for my end-of month statement, which I will get in 2 weeks, and then I hope I will finally get my money back.        "	                3	1	Tuesday	agoda	positive

We arrived in Rome for a 4 day break only to find that there was no room for available for us. The hotel contacted Agoda and was told they had cancelled our booking but we hadn’t been sent an email. Stranded in Rome. We, fortunately, managed to find another hotel close by. I received a call from Agoda Later that day who said they would refund the booking, would also pay 20% compensation in the form of Agoda vouchers. Told them I would never book with them again so wanted monetary compensation and they would also consider paying the additional €114 for the difference between my original booking price and the new hotel. I’ve been refunded the original amount but nothing else. I can’t ring them because the booking ref is closed and they aren’t responding to emails. Seriously, the distress this caused was horrific.

540	            While I could cancel my reservation easily online, changing the number of rooms for my booking was impossible, even after waiting for a long time holding to talk to a customer service representative.  I also waited over 36 hours and never heard a response to my inquiry via e-mail.  Expect to wait for at least 20 minutes if you want to talk to a customer service representative and even then they may not be able to make basic adjustments to your reservation.  After canceling 2 of my 3 rooms via a customer service representative and seeing that my reservation was changed, the price remained the same.

544	            Booked a hotel room through agoda in Edinburgh, The Northumberland Hotel, and when we arrived the room was disgusting. It was advertised as double room we could have extra large bed in but was cupboard size with regular bed, the shower linoleum was all ripped and there was mould on the walls. On further inspection of the room it was filthy with dust everywhere. We complained to the hotel manager,Mr Flotis, who came up to have a look and agreed it was unnaceptable and as they had no other rooms agreed to speak with owner about making an exception to the non refund policy on it. We left the hotel and phoned agoda who said they would follow it up and cancel our booking. Waited all weekend for response and when it came they stated owner had decided to refuse refund and as he was there client they had to stand by that. Took our money for no room...disgusting!!

Agoda advertised free parking, we all came to find that there is none, hotel also trying to contact them to ask they remove the misinformation and refund at least the parking to us.

561	            Absolutely shambolic.We booked the wrong dates (Yes it was a silly oversight) yet there is no cooling off period allowed with this company and you can be hundreds out of pocket as a consequence despite just wanting a date changed, it meant the whole cost was lost and there were extra charges to re book within hours of the original booking despite it not costing Agoda or the Hotel a penny with the booking 9 months in advance.In the payment area there is a line in light blue on a white background saying it isn't refundable, this  is at the end of the booking process which has a timer telling you to hurry to get the price.For the new dates Agoda wanted an extra £400 as well as the money they wouldn't refund however by making a new booking this was only £300. Sums them up.Try to get through to any form of customer services and forget it, it is an endless loop.One of the customer service line is pay per minute, it will inevitably send you back to the website despite charging you.Pay a few £ more and have the peace of mind by going elsewhere, never again.        	                25	1	Thursday	agoda	neutral

565	            The company advertised a good rate for the hotel but honestly, I should've done it with Expedia. The website gave me the option to choose 1 king bed or 2 singles, giving me the impression that the hotel offered that, little did I know this was a 'special request', when I arrived at the hotel they advised me I booked a double room and the option for 2 single beds was not something the offered and simply and 'extra request' (how on earth will the be able to ever do that if the hotel simply doesn't have the facilities for it?!) I then had to upgrade and pay extra to get accommodation with 2 separate beds. I then tried to call them, however, they make you input everything on the phone before you get to speak to a human, your booking number, your card number, etc... worst part when you get one of those numbers wrong they simply hang up on you!

570	            Booked a hotel through Agoda for a recent trip to NY. When booking we paid for £212 discounted room rate, which came to around £1400 with the hotel tax and additional hotel facilities fee brought it up to £1634. I got an email confirmation from Agoda on final total and believed it was all sorted. At the end of my stay at the hotel was told the facilities fee hadn't been paid by Agoda, and was charged again on my card. On speaking with Agoda on my return, they insisted the facilities fee was never included and that unless I had a screenshot of my order onscreen they would not refund. They were not able to confirm to me what room rate I was charged, and told me that different rates are offered to different users and there would not be one flat rate for the day booked. Find it hugely unacceptable they could not confirm with me or had no details of the itemised billing of my booking that appeared on screen when originally ordering.

584	            I have booked in a hotel using Agoda and upon arrival they couldn't find my booking. So I ended up having the pay the hotel directly. Turns out when I called Agoda they have booked using a third party. I had spent almost a month chasing for a refund of my money paid to Agoda since I made a direct payment at the hotel. Even after sending my UK bank statements and receipts which clearly showed the amount debited by the hotel, they flat out refuded to accept any of it concluded that the hotel DID NOT charge me and decided to close the case.It looks someone somewhere in management made a decision to somehow close the case and act as if nothing happened and take the money for themselves. Also note there is no way to directly contact through phone once the booking has ended. The only way you could even try to communicate is through email. I wish I had the read the reviews ealier. Under any circumstance it looks like Agoda will not REFUND your money once they have it. Also note this is a not a EU based company so they manage to escape all regulations that EU based customers are familiar with. So it seems they have been practising unethical practises to make money at the cost of anything to the customers.        	                2	1	Sunday	agoda	positive

592	            The worst booking site I’ve ever had dealings with. They sell rooms that aren’t available, they never answer calls, don’t reply to emails  and do nothing to rectify problems. I have had successful bookings through them but whenever there’s a problem, it’s tough s**t, you’re on your own because you will not get any help from them.        	                2	1	Friday	agoda	negative

595	            booked a room thru agoda (payment made), went to the hotel, waited for 1 hour and 30 minutes for the reception to receive the booking. while waiting i contacted agoda and they told my booking has been canceled because of the timings (last minute booking). WHAT THE EF? i end up on another hotel with the feeling of being scammed. their service was not like this on my recent trips. it happens several times already prior to this.

No refund offered other than a 10% gift card. So £19 off a future booking. Even when checking with hotel myself, Agoda still happy to sell rooms via their website at a higher price that are not available.

606	            I have used Agoda for the last years. I have never experienced problems before. I am actually very shocked at the service I am receiving recently. I made a cancellation to a booking. Not only was I charged 115% more than the original price I had paid. Now I am trying to fix an error on the booking. Tried calling their call centres since Mondays at various times in the day. No answer. Average waiting time seems like its more than an hour. Would also like to say, I have contacted the hotel directly, they are more than willing to assist but Agoda is to make the change. What will I do now? Go back in to the system that is built to make me pay again? Keep calling them? I have messaged this company more than 20 times. No response. I wish I could edit the stars to 0.        	                1	1	Wednesday	agoda	neutral

Whilst Agoda can't control the quality of the hotels - they CAN give you honest information, which they don't.  It's all about trapping you in to a purchase.Honest reviews aren't posted, only positive reviews with 'small critiques' appear on the website to fool you into thinking it's balanced. You're basically just reading advertisements.  Please use other sites with integrity to verify (trip advisor/Google reviews).        	                3	1	Wednesday	agoda	positive

The hotel actually agreed they would refund but said I needed to go through Agoda.

613	"            Traveler BEWARE. I booked a hotel through their site that boasted a 6.8 stars out of 10 for a week in Hawaii. The pictures made the hotel look clean and fresh, and while I realized it was not the best available, I booked it because of the price point. We stayed one night. It was horrible. There were roaches in the bathroom, the entire ""hotel"" was grimy and worse than some hostels I've stayed at. We attempted to get our refund for the remaining 7 day we refused to stay at the, clearly not vetted, hotel. Agoda had no easily accessible customer service line, and apparently, once your stay is over, you cannot call their help line to assist you. It took reporting them as fraudulent charges to my bank before they would contact and refund me. They even went as far as to ask the grimy hotel how much they wanted to charge me for the one night we stayed, because we couldn't find another hotel on such short notice. I ended up being charged MORE than the price I'd agreed to pay nightly and some bogus ""amenity fee"" the hotel threw in even though we couldn't have used any of their facilities even if we'd wanted to.

617	            Careful.... I booked a hotel with a double and a single bed for a family and when I arrived they said they had a room with two singles. They didn't even do rooms like that I booked.  I checked the booking meticulously before hand and once booked there were no details of the beds on the confirmation. I showed the hotel staff similar adverts and they simply blamed Agoda. Two other separate people complained about similar issues whist I was there. The in country phone numbers either don't work or agoda staff state they don't deal with hotels bookings. The hotel said I could cancel and they wouldn't charge but agoda pre charge your card and keep  the full amount regardless.        	                7	1	Tuesday	agoda	neutral

621	            I am writing this review to WARN other people from using AGODA'S services. I booked a hotel with them for TOMORROW HOTEL in Taiwan and was CHARGED TWICE for my booking. They did not inform me that they already charged my card for the pre-authorization charge and the pre-authorization charge is THE FULL AMOUNT. Since I have no knowledge of the charge they made, I agreed to pay the hotel when we checked in. EVEN THE HOTEL DID NOT RECORD THAT I HAVE ALREADY BEEN CHARGED AND ASKED ME TO PAY ANYWAY. Now, when I got my credit card billing statement, both charges are reflected! And because I disputed the amount they had to cancel my card and I still had to pay for the amount they charged otherwise I will be charged with a fee! SO INCONVENIENT. Their customer service is SO POOR, it takes them DAYS to respond and they don't offer any valuable resolution to the problem. NEVER AGAIN AGODA.        	                1	1	Monday	agoda	negative
622	            I am very disappointed with Agoda booking and its “Customer Service.” I booked a night at JJ Grand Hotel in Los Angeles, Sep 8th to Sep 9th, and, upon my arrival, I was informed it had been canceled even though my card was charged and I received an email confirmation along with a receipt a few minutes after I booked my room. I tried contacting the “24/7 Customer Service” but nobody responded. I ended up paying a higher price for my room. What kind of service is this? Is this how Agoda.com treats customers? I BELIEVE THIS IS A SCAM. At this point I am not satisfied at all with Agoda and I WILL NOT RECOMMEND Agoda.com to anybody for any future bookings. I am still hoping to receive an answer and a compensation from a representative as soon as possible. PLEASE, DO NOT BOOK USING AGODA.COM.        	                1	1	Monday	agoda	negative

The last time before that the villa advertised as 5 star was actually 3 star (looked like 2 star) . And last but not least they allowed booking into a villa that was under renovation arriving in bali with nowhere to stay. Not to mention they are impossible to contact cannot get past automated voice buy calling. Cannot get past automated email system.Cannot even leave feedback on the faulty survey form as it does not allow negative feedback. I will never use agoda again.

Trying to find a way to contact the customer service via email but it's so hard to find a way to contact them.I don't understand why they don't charge directly the amount in local currency. Oh, maybe I do. If they can overcharge a +5% for every transaction... that's a good business (for them, but not for me!)        	                12	1	Sunday	agoda	neutral

649	            website is easy to use, but information is not always correct. I booked a hotel from my family (4 people), taking an exec suite. During the booking process, I entered the number of people (4) and selected the option for breakfast to be included. The summary showed 4 people and breakfast included. I later found out that from the hotel directly that breakfast is only for 2 people! This is not made clear anywhere in the booking information or summary. I tried to get in touch with customer services, and after waiting 30 mins on the phone on two separate occasions, I gave up and tried to email. I got responses back several days later. The responses always said the same thing that yes there is an additional charge. When I asked about how do I get this issue escalated, because the information is misleading, that part of my question is ignored. I would have preferred to speak to someone, since the individuals responding on email are either BOTS or really do not understand English, and perhaps a conversation can help to elaborate what I am actually asking.

668	            i used agoda last year and had no problems, so decided to use them this year for 5 countries and some countries a few resort, so far few hotels booked. the odd 1 wasnt as good as expected others good.i have to say i arrived at mihilaka villa in sri lanka at 3am shattered and omg it was horrendous, i booked a 2 bed 2 bathroom villa , photos looked great, was advertised a with hot tub, washing machine which is why a booked being away a month, full kitchen , air conditioning, good wifi , lounge etc.it ended up 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom, no hot tub, no full kitchen, no washing machine, wifi poor, air con only in bedroom and hardly worked, the lounge was brick like a garage with deck chairs and a fridge. it was absolutely hideous with dead cockroaches, i asked why it didnt look as described and he admitted he had used some of his own house photos omg. we refused to stay the whole time, but had to stay 1 night due to it being 3 am and booked somewhere else with agoda so they could see we hadnt stayed there.i tried to ring from the villa first but got no reply. i emailed them a big complaint explaining all issues, put a negative and honest report on agoda site . the report 1 mth later has not been added, so ive put 1 on here for others to see. they asked me for photo evidence i had loads of photos and told them man admitted he used some of his house pics. they have not done anything about it. nor are they answering the phone or answering my questions via email as to why they havent added my honest review or why they havent altered the villa description and changed photos, which is falsely advertised in both description and photos i will never use them again, not sure if they can be reported anywhere for false advertising , be very careful anyone that uses this company as they ignore emails too        	                7	1	Sunday	agoda	negative

672	            Geboekt, betaald en geannuleerd door AGODA 4 uur voor ons aankomst in het hotel. Vervolgens bij later contact wordt er ook nog gezegd dat wij geannuleerd hebben terwijl dat zeker niet door ons was. hier onder is de gang van zaken te lezen. Echt zeer slecht. Timeline of events: 25 of july (6 days before our trip): we booked the hotel28 of july (3 days before the trip): I got an email that the hotel was not available, but an other was (coconut beach). We reacted in two to three hours that this was allright.29 of july: We asked by email if the booking was already changed to coconut beach, the return answer was we had to give agoda 24 hours time to arrange the new booking30 of july: no confirmation or other email from agoda, so after two extra emails I called. The coconut hotel was also not available and for some reason no one had told us that untill we called. I spoke to someone who would look for a new hotel. At the and of the evening I was called back that she fount us something else. Because of all the inconvenience caused, we would also get a 75 dollar gift card. 31 of july (day of our booking) at 5.30 am (my local time)!!!! I was called that this hotel was also not available, she looked for something else but could not find it and than agoda cancelled our booking entirely at the day of our trip. We had to find ourselfs a new accomodation 4 hours before we would arrive on our destination!!!        	                1	1	Saturday	agoda	negative

677	            Just visited yet another terrible hotel booked through Agoda. The type of hotel where you get 2 star services but advertises as 4 stars and costs 150 Euros per night while you barely can sleep and they feed you some scrambled eggs and brownish hot water as coffee.Funny when Agoda asked me to review this hotel, my review was not positive and so they didn't publish it.The hotel still has 9 stars + on Agoda, and makes other people miserable during their vacation, while making a lot of money from false advertisement.Agoda likes to keep properties like this looking good of course because how else would they make money?        	                10	1	Saturday	agoda	neutral

687	            Customer Be Aware! Agoda.com does have very competitive prices but be careful and don't fall for their ad that your credit card will not be charged. The hotels they support will absolutely charge your card and claim that your booking is non refundable, no matter what Agoda falsely advertise about free cancellations! It is an absolute scam1 Be sure you will use the hotel before booking!!        	                1	1	Wednesday	agoda	positive
688	            My advice.. Be careful with this company If You already have a reservation call the hotel your self and make sure it does exist with same specification I did my reservation through Agoda and paid extra for a garden view. Discovered on checking in that rooms booked were not standard and view we had was looking roof of w a business a building. Called them, they apologized for the mistake and promised for a refund which they denied later!! Unfortunately, searched lately and discovered that this is a common complaint        	                2	1	Wednesday	agoda	neutral

697	"            I have tried other booking websites and they haven't run as smoothly. I like that there is currency selection available, accumulated ""points"" (like getting money off my next place) and a pretty extensive range that all seem to be cheaper than other websites. Writing the review while I look up reviews on other websites and realised I should put positive reviews in too. I've found that hostelworld.com will be cheaper sometimes for dorms although I'm pretty sure both these sites will price match.        "	                1	5	Tuesday	agoda	positive

708	            Customer service is absolutely non-existent. I had a booking not processed properly by them and could not contact them via phone or email. My emails were eventually answered about 10 days after I was due to stay. They refused to refund me because it was in the past (because of their delay) and I kept getting emails saying my issue had been marked as resolved and could I fill out a survey to tell them how they did. I eventually got offered a gift card with the value instead of a refund to card and accepted it because I was so sick of constantly trying to get a response. Now I find it’s only valid for a month and, in the three cities I’ve checked so far, there is not a single property that accepts gift cards. I feel like they’ve stolen my money.        	                1	1	Sunday	agoda	positive

Nothing from Agoda, no message or explanation. I went onto  Agoda site to find my reservation had been cancelled. I rang them to find out why. Automated service, as soon as I put the reservation code in it just told me what I already knew it had been cancelled then cut me off. My gripe with the company is do not take money from accounts before confirmation of availability. The money takes time to go back into accounts limiting choice and availability. To not communicate and just cancel a booking is unproffessional and extremely rude. I will not be using this company again I like communication and certainty when my money is taken.        	                1	1	Sunday	agoda	neutral

720	"            TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE! THESE PEOPLE DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS AT ALL! I booked a room through their app and after Agoda confirmed the reservation the property manager emailed to tell me that he needed more info and that I needed to go back to Agoda to input this info into my profile.  I spoke with too many Agoda reps that said they don't take this info and that the property manager shouldn't be asking for it. The property manager said he would not confirm the booking without this info but would not take the info directly from me and that I had to go through Agoda.   Sound like the twilight zone??? Exactly! Bottom line the property manager was very rude and only cared about getting my money and the Agoda reps did not care about assisting me with anything either. The property manager did not confirm my booking however did take the money out of my account and because of the cancellation policy would not refund my money eventhough he knew that this was not my fault! Then for my ""troubles"" Agoda offered me an 8.71 gift card to redeem towards another room.  10% of the room rate that I lost to the crook of a property manager! I am pretty sure all of the good one line reviews on this site are from Agoda reps. This company is a scam!!        "	                1	1	Saturday	agoda	positive

723	            Worst experience with a third party vendor ever. Booked via Agoda website. When I chose my dates and paid for the room I received a confirmation with the incorrect dates. I went on the site to modify my booking and they mentioned I had no outstanding booking, yet I had my confirmation. I tried calling the number provided on the site and the number was not active. I really thought I've been had. Just lost $165. I called the hotel that I booked and they also mentioned to me that they have had issue's with this vendor in the past. The manager at the hotel said that she has a back door to reach the vendor and they will try to fix the issue. I received a call from Agoda about an hour later. The agent said he was sorry about the situation and that he will fix the dates for me. I did receive a confirmation email with the correct dates. When I arrive at the hotel the reservation was never changed and to make the matter worse, the hotel was fully booked. I was very upset and frustrated. One of the staff had just hung up the phone and told me that they just received a cancellation for tonight. They offered me the upgraded room at no extra cost. I travel a lot and I will never use Agoda again. Don't need all of these issue's.        	                1	1	Friday	agoda	negative

A bit unsure, they always seemed consistently cheaper than the other hotel booking websites, but I'd never heard of them before, and with the family in tow...But no need to worry! All bookings worked as expected, money taken out of the credit card on times, any cancellations all worked fine.

729	            The problem is Agoda are part of a much bigger collection of companies so one description is repeated across the whole network and you have no comeback when things go wrong.I recently rented a high market Villa in Madeira with swimming pool and air conditioning but the truth was this Villa has fixed Panoramic windows and not shutters but Security Blinds and without Air Conditioning in the heat of summer unbearable. The Agents knew this and still advertised on all the websites Air Conditioning as a premium feature. On other websites NO CHILDREN for obvious reasons a child could easily be severely injured or KILLED but all they care about is the money.        	                5	1	Friday	agoda	negative

734	            We booked a hotel in the USA some time ago through Agoda as part of a road trip and paid in advance.  When we arrived at the place the hotel had been sold, and was being refurbished by another group - we stayed in a nearby hotel.  I asked Agoda for a refund of my hotel fees, and maybe some compensation for the trouble cause.  After 2 months where they delayed and refused to apologise they said they would refund the hotel bill and offered a derisory $8 compensation - I am still waiting for the refund and the compensation - deal with this agency at your own peril.        	                17	1	Thursday	agoda	negative

The hotels you can book are limited to try and use the gift voucher was a nightmare. Finally booked thinking I had booked with breakfast up to value of voucher. No breakfast. Rang them to query (10mins this time to get through) and they said I had booked a superior room so the booking was correct, didn't get the fact I didn't care what room it was, I was booking to value of voucher and wanted breakfast. I give up I will never use them again and would not recommend.

755	            This site is a complete and total rip off. I booked a weekend room and paid for it a month in advance. When I arrived the Hilton hotel said the room wasn't paid for. They ran my card again just so I could check in. Months later Agoda still hasn't refunded my money and I have paid for the room twice. I travel a fair bit and have never had such an issue with a booking site. They have an excuse of being in different time zones, basically they steal your money because they are in a different country.  Don't waste your money and time!!!!!!        	                1	1	Tuesday	agoda	neutral

762	            I made a reservation for a hotel in Stirling Scotland some months ago through Agoda and just stayed at this hotel on 17th August.The rate quoted was £159 for dinner, bed and breakfast.  The hotel had received a different amount quoted from Agoda of £181.  Agoda put the cost through in Canadian funds which worked out to approximately £200.  I was very upset with this final amount I paid, but soon found out that Agoda doesn’t have an email address or phone number to complain.  I did contact the hotel before staying there and they stated that they just get the funds from Agoda and there was nothing they could do about it. Out of interest I went on to a travel site and other travel sites were quoting £99 per night and Agoda was still quoting £159..  I feel ripped off by Agoda.  I will never use them again.        	                1	1	Monday	agoda	neutral

They said Agoda never pays them so they will not release the address.  Agoda lied and said they took care of everything with the owner.  Called the owner and manager back and they both said they can't give me the room even though I paid Agoda.  This has been going on for days and agoda will not refund me even though I was forced to book a second hotel that night.  Went through about 18 back and forth emails with Agoda lying to me.  Every question gets assigned a different member of Agodas team so nobody ever knows what's fully going on because they would never read everything.        	                1	1	Thursday	agoda	negative

801	            I booked a hotel in London with two rooms in July for £302. This was at a similar price to other hotels in the area. 2 weeks before the trip I receive the following email from Agoda;Greetings from Agoda.com. With reference to your booking ID redacted as detailed below: Hotel: name withheld. Room Type: Standard Triple - Double and single Number of Rooms: 2 City/Country: London/United Kingdom Arrival: 8/5/2018 12:00:00 AM Departure: 8/8/2018 12:00:00 AM Due to an unforeseen technical issue, you were charged an incorrect price for this booking. Your booking was for 2 rooms at USD 402.90 per room, for a total booking price of USD 805.80. However, you were only charged / your card was authorized for the price of just one room, USD 402.90. Therefore, we would need to secure additional payment/authorization of the additional USD 402.90 in order to confirm the remaining room(s) in your booking. Please use the link below to complete the additional payment of USD 402.90 and secure the remaining rooms. You’ll be able to use your Visa, MasterCard, JCB, or AMEX cards. Link removed due to trust pilot rules. If you do not confirm the additional payment via the secure link above within 24 hours, your booking will be automatically cancelled, and you will be refunded the full amount of the payment already made.I called the hotel who stated the booking was confirmed with no issues and paid for.  I was suspicious of the email and ignored it. I tried calling Agoda, but could not get through to anyone. The following day my booking was cancelled automatically and refunded. I subsequently booked a cheaper room at a better location through a competitors site.Will never be using again.        	                3	1	Wednesday	agoda	neutral

818	            Almost rated it 1 star due to an issue with a non-refundable booking. I booked an hotel for 1 night with an incorrect date of check in/out. Though it was my mistake at first and I noticed it immediately but their site is tricky enough and can get you to use incorrect dates if you are not careful. After a lot of friction and calls to customer care, they cancelled the booking and refunded to a gift card. I assume since it was the third time I was calling and they already said nothing could be done, they didn't want it to escalate more. In the end they gained my trust by refunding me and I booked a different and more expensive hotel, so good for them. Bottom line, be careful with the dates of reservations.        	                1	3	Monday	agoda	positive

820	"            I see that Agoda has some ""good"" reviews but these seem to be in the far east countries where Agoda originates from.  I am based in the UK and have recently used this company. What an AWFUL experience. Why?  I made a booking with them a couple of months back. Fine no issues. It was when I came to try to amend the booking the nightmare began. First, I could never ever get through customer services on the telephone number advertised in the London office. I phoned several times and gave up after holding (every time) for a minimum of 20 minutes.  I tried email and got an immediate automatic acknowledgement and that's where it ended. I was very keen to sort out my issue very quickly and so took action via another method with a satisfactory outcome. I hasten to add that 2 weeks later (this weekend) I did receive a ""human"" email back from Agoda..... telling me that they could NOT assist with the query (which as I said I HAD resolved).  There is not even a live chat facility. So would say their customer services are very poor and practically unreachable. Will not be using again too much hassle and aggravation.

848	            Inquired via email about cancelling a non-refundable booking, Agoda replied that they would not be able to give a refund, blaming the hotel. And in the same reply informed me that my hotel was now CANCELLED and my refund was $0. To me this is highly fraudulent, I expect at least to be asked to confirm the cancellation.        	                1	1	Thursday	agoda	negative

852	"            Turned up at hotel, hotel never heard of us or Agoda, Ok, not too much of a problem, paid for second room and called Agoda on the day of our return!Now the above detail is a pain, and risky if hotel busy but what turns this into a 1 star (0) star review is agoda did little to nothing to help me on my return. Promised call backs never happened, cut and paste emails about their refund policy, told to deal with Hotel to get refund from them, etc, etc. Thank god for credit cards and above £100 charges. Mastercard charged the £126 back to me but Agoda are still sending emails about ""we can give you a 45 day credit"" ""we need to look into this"" etc, etc. Anyone can sell space in someone else's property, what distinguishes the good from the bad is what they do, or don't do when it goes wrong, I could be wrong but this doesn't feel like a world wide operation, They have little to no reputation in UK so carry no weight and unfortunately didn't care about my loss, more their own potential financial loss of commission clearly not earnt.Do what the hotel said ""booking.com""        "	                5	1	Wednesday	agoda	negative

911	            Hi Customer Services AGODA  is bad never trust with with your booking.I am back at my office today from my recent trip. I am a very unhappy customer with my booking at the EASY HOTEL ZAANDAM that was not paid by AGODA. I got confirmation that all was well until I arrived at the hotel. I was told AGODA never paid any money to the hotel and that I have no booking with them and they are fully booked for this time. I stayed I night in the Zaandam easy hotel and had to move some 20km away to the Hotel De WITTE Hoeck. It was also a long walk from the station to this hotel with my luggage. The hotel was also much more expensive than the easy hotel and very inconvenient to stay at. I request that your office compensates me for the difference I had to pay for this stay.One month later still no positive reply from AGODA bad terrible serviceFerrus        	                1	2	Thursday	agoda	negative

Meaning we paid twice for the same room, (280 EUR, 460 EUR in total). We have submitted receipts. We have since may trying to get a refund for the reservation but with no luck, only a repeating mail saying the same thing over and over again, so never again Agoda!        	                1	1	Tuesday	agoda	neutral

After fighting with the mangement for two days they ""upgraded"" me to a hotel next door which had half the room size and no view. Further complaints with Agoda resultet in an offer of a 100 USD voucher for ""participating hotels"" on their website. Voucher would have been valid for 3 months only. What a joke.

Today i check my email and received an email confirming a booking for one dodgy apartment. So i panicked and logged on to my agoda phone app, there really was a booking done! So when i click ""cancel booking"", a disclaimer pops out stating if i cancel the booking they will charge full price to my credit card. I tried calling agoda on their 24/7 customer service and been on hold for 1 hour! What a scam! Absolutely furious with Agoda!        "	                1	2	Saturday	agoda	negative

980	            Agoda messed my booking, giving me a tiny room for a family of four, with the final outcome of having the whole family(2 adults+2kids) sleeping in very poor conditions(1 double bed and not too much space on the floor) for 5 nights (420USD booking). The hotel charges HKD300 (38USD) per night for an extra bed (that won't fit in the room). What Agoda offered me as compensation was a 30USD voucher to be used on a booking...Just pathetic, I don't want it as will NEVER BOOK WITH AGODA again.        	                1	1	Monday	agoda	negative

994	            Charged double the price by a hotel as advertised on Agoda. It was late at night in an unfamiliar Mexican neighbourhood, so felt had no choice but to pay and open a case with Agoda. Twelve emails later which were responded to by twelve different Agoda staff, many of which kept duplicating requests and ignoring prior emails, the case remains unresolved and I am out of pocket. Customer service is zero and they appear to have hired all staff from the bottom of the unemployment barrel.        	                1	1	Thursday	agoda	negative

996	            Honestly worst customer service ever. I booked my birthday weekend in Mont-treblemant, booked a 3 bedroom suite with kitchen, the hotel confirms a hotel room with 2 double beds. Agoda apparently booekd the wrong room, leaving me to decide what to do with my guests as that room wont accommodate everyone, since by the time it came up  the hotel was out of suites big enough to manage my group. They apologized but did NOTHING To try and solve the problem, just advised that the rooms were sold out and sorry. Like??? I spent two days going back and forth trying to savage my birthday weekend as most of the hotels in the vicinity were booked or twice the price. The wait times everytime i called were easily 30 minutes or more and the help i got was almost existence.

1018	            I had such a negative experience with Agoda recently. Booked a hotel on their website and when I arrived, the hotel said they had never signed a contract with Agoda and my fully paid reservation was considered void!Called Agoda up and they promised a refund. That was on 20 June. Until today, no sign of the refund. Extremely disappointed with their service. You can be sure that my family and friends will not be using Agoda.        	                1	1	Tuesday	agoda	neutral
1019	            They are cheating - the price you are paying may not include the entire costs. Additional costs may apply. Like in our case we booked 2 adults and 2 children. When we arrived at the hotel we had to pay for our 2 children again, since the hotel only received payment for 2 adults.Agoda don’t want to give us the refund - only a stupid gift card after writing with their customer support 2-3 times. They won’t admit that they made a mistake.        	                2	1	Monday	agoda	neutral

Despite this and the fact that we were then standing outside the apartment with suitcases with accomodation to find - we were charged for our trouble.Still going through the claim process for which I don't hold out much hope.  Just thank goodness I used a credit card to book.I did also question how high the review ratings on this site were, however given the content of many reviews - I think the reason for the higher rating is obvious.        	                4	1	Wednesday	agoda	positive

1047	"            Whilst the booking experience was good, additional ""resort"" charges were only displayed after the booking was complete. This makes it difficult to compare agoda prices with other sites. Not including the ""resort fee"" charge makes it look like they are offering a good price whereas in actual fact the price is the same or higher than other sites.

1069	            We booked to stay in a 5* hotel in Las Vegas and paid in full 4 months ago. When we arrived last weekend we were told that there was no booking. We called Agoda and although the telephone calls were expensive (phoning on our mobile phones registered in the UK), the matter was resolved within 24 hours. I was credited with a 10% inconvenience fee - which will just about cover the phone calls..... Thanks Agoda for resolving the matter.        	                2	5	Saturday	agoda	positive
1070	            Ladies and Gentlemen, do yourself a favor and use a different website.  Even if this site is cheaper you will pay in another way.  I recently used the site to book a hotel in Okinawa for two nights.  The website itself was easy to use and I had no problem making my reservation.  Immediately my credit card was charged the entire amount.  Make no mistake, this company has that part down.  Included in the price for the room was 20 percent, which was listed as a service fee.  Prior to my stay there was a typhoon in Okinawa.  It brought high winds and a lot of rain.  The after effect was still ongoing on the day I was to check in.  Since it was a beach resort there was really nothing I could do there because of the weather.  But, I had already paid so I drove to the resort anyway.  Upon arrival I spoke with the Hotel Representative about my options.  I asked if I did cancel how much of a refund would I get, if any.  Now mind you I am American.  I do not speak Japanese so I talked to multiple people at the hotel before I spoke to someone who spoke enough english to work on my issue.  She told me that she couldn’t help me because I booked the hotel through Agoda.  She then provided the phone number to call them directly to ask them about the potential refund if I canceled the day of.  Agoda’s website states if you cancel 2 or 1 day prior you are charged 20 percent.  It also states that if you do not show up you do not rate a refund.  I understood that prior to going to the hotel.  I was going to stay at the resort if I wasn’t going to receive any refund amount because I already paid for it.  I was just asking so I could make a good decision for myself and my family.  I spoke to Agoda on the phone and after going back and forth I was told that I would receive 50 percent refund for canceling the day of my reservation.  Since my total charge was 553.06 US dollars, I agreed because half of that is a lot of money.  I told the hotel representatives thank you and I left.  While I was driving home I received three phone calls, which I didn’t answer because I was driving.  When I arrived home I had also received an email.  It was from Agoda stating that I would not be receiving any refund because I canceled my reservation.  And then it began.... I emailed Agoda multiple times telling them what had happened.  I gave them the number I called, the time I called, and the fact that I was In the hotel lobby when I called.  There was 7 different emails sent, which were all responded to by different representatives asking me the same questions.  It came down to them saying because I didn’t remember the name of the person I talked to on the phone I didn’t rate a refund.  Who remembers something like that?  If I knew then what I know now I would have recorded the entire conversation.  I would like to think that you don’t have to do that because the company that you are dealing with are professional.  That is not the case in this situation.  All the email responses stated that I canceled my reservation so I wasn’t going to get a refund.  I told them in every email, I canceled after I spoke to the Agoda representative who told me that I was going to get a 50 percent refund.  Finally after I disputed the charge on my credit card and sent them the last email in which I stated I hope Agoda goes out of business, they sent me a discount code for my next purchase which was worth 50 dollars which is 10 percent of my total.  Long story short I spent 553.06 dollars for nothing.  Now I canceled, nobody made me do that, for that I was prepared to give up half because the weather was going to ruin my trip.  The fact that I was mislead by Agoda who told me I was going to be refunded some of my money is wrong.  Then later they claimed they could not find my phone call in their records is shady.  They have scammed me out of 256.73 US dollars and then claimed that I didn’t even call their number in the first place.  I will never use any travel site again.  I will call the hotel directly so I do not need to worry about the middle man who charged me 20 percent in the first place.  Read other reviews about Agoda.  All the ones about their customer service are the same.  Their grade from the Better Business Bureau is a F.  There is a reason for that.  I am not alone in my view of this company.  Again, use a different site.  If you give Agoda an opportunity to scam you, they will.        	                1	1	Saturday	agoda	positive

1077	"            I do not trust Agoda at all. Their databases and their website are not up to date. My husband and I wanted to book a hotel for our family and we were excited to find just what we were looking for on the Agoda site ONLY TO LATER FIND OUT THE ROOM WAS UNAVAILABLE AND OUR FUNDS WERE BEING HELD BY OUR BANK IN LIMBO BECAUSE AGODA ""PROCESSES THE FUNDS"".  Do NOT trust what you see on this website. I am so displeased with them. I then called and spoke to a rep after being on hold for 16 minutes listening to elevator music and the only thing she said she could do for me was to dispute the bank claim, to which I replied--- Your job is to find us rooms and be honest on your website ----she had no reply!  They need to fix their website. Also, she didn't apologize until halfway through the call. 1 HOUR and 8 minutes later of talking with her and there was still no room and Agoda was holding my funds.  If the room says that it is available---DON'T TRUST IT! Their site is completely unreliable, they will also hold your funds and not tell you about it until it's too late.

1089	            Will try to keep it short as I never leave reviews but agoda has taken the cake this time and I wanted to share: Agoda customer service is pathetic/incompetent. They do not understand a basic question/issue at hand. I had booked a hotel through agoda, asked for a price match guarantee as Booking.com had the same thing for cheaper (only wanted to use a gift voucher hence booking on agoda else booking.com is a million times better!) Agoda responds saying 'we are delighted to price match and xx amount has been removed off your booking'. it is STILL not as cheap as booking.com and this is when the issues start. you have to hold for an average of 20-30 mins to get through to an agent/email responses take about 2-3 days and each time a new person responds so you have to repeat the issue again and again. After calling them 4 times and having a dozen email responses - issue still not solved. they don't understand basic concept of exchange rates or base rate. They book in USD, hotel charges in local currency and they are charging me in GBP because I am based in UK. So when I tell them 10 times base rate is the hotel currency because that is what it mentions on my booking and that needs to be matched to booking.com rate - they say okay and again give me a different rate (higher). Since it is a book now, pay later option it is provided on the day of payment. BUt that doesn't give me the solution that the BASE RATE needs to be the same if you are advertising as price match. Another smart alec yesterday tells me - okay we will price match (and I also had a gift voucher of about $25 USD but the price is same with or without the gift voucher - how that is possible only she will know! that makes my voucher worthless! according to her, price match is after the gift voucher was used. So I tell her if I didn't use the voucher what is the price - she said the same???? ready to tear my hair out because they are so so incompetent. it has been about 3 weeks since booking and still not sorted. will probvably cancel the booking.        	                1	1	Tuesday	agoda	positive

1105	            We took a south india trip and stayed in many hotels.  The booking through Agoda was the worst.  They charged me on a place few days ahead of my stay but due to some unforeseen I could not make it for that night check-in but I could next day.  Their customer service was awful with literally no consideration.  The same kind of booking rigidity was not there with booking.com.  Avoid agoda if you can.

1110	            Agoda just scammed me by charging my credit card without sending me a booking confirmation. According to Agoda the email address was wrong but the Agoda system does not record any undelivered emails as they do not track any undelivered email. A great way of either deliberately changing peoples emails or hoping people will make a mistake entering their email address so that that people can be scammed. Agoda provided the hotel with an incorrect email address.        	                1	1	Thursday	agoda	positive

1141	            We booked a hotel via agoda that turned out to be not as advertised and unfit for human habitation. We immediately checked out and provided evidence to agoda of the misleading information provided on THEIR website and asked that agoda refund us the money for our stay. Agoda has refused to provide a refund despite the fact that it is potentially complicit in breach of Vietnamese advertising law. I have asked repeatedly for a copy of the evidence provided by the hotel, a detailed explanation of agodas positing and for the matter to be dealt with by management. Despite this I keep getting the same repeated response from a different member of the customer service team each time which fails to even acknowledge my requests. This is absolutely disgusting behaviour, agoda clearly do not care about their customers and are only interested in taking people's money even if it involves misleading adverts and unfit accommodation. I would strongly advise everyone against using agoda. I certainly won't be using them ever again.        	                2	1	Thursday	agoda	negative

1162	            I just had a awful experience with Agoda today (JUNE 18).  I booked Humble House Taipei 2 rooms for 1 night (ie. June 21 check in June 22 check out)  via Agoda.com last week.  They were selling rooms with pretty good price while the hotel website already sold out.  I thought I was lucky to secure two rooms with them with a clause that if any cancellation, have to do it by June 16.  After I made the bookings, I further reconfirmed with Agoda by logging into their system. Since I am travelling with my parents who are in 70's, I wanted to make sure the bookings are secured.  Therefore, I made a phone call to hotel directly and tried to confirm booking today.  Guess What?  They could not find my bookings.  Hotel's front desk was kind enough to call Agoda to follow up my bookings and nothing was found.  This happened around 1pm today.  Meanwhile I called Agoda and spoke to customer service who once again confirmed my bookings were ok despite what I told her the information I obtained from hotel.  I therefore called the Hotel that my bookings were confirmed.  Agoda's lies finally burst.  They called me up at 6pm and informed me that hotel called them up and there will not be rooms for me on June 21 and so need to cancel the bookings.  What a joke!!  I told them I am the one who made effort to verify the booking.  If i have not done that, I would not find out I have NO ROOMS until I arrive hotel.  They did not even apologize as they did not think is their responsibility AND SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE SO USED TO THIS COMPLAINS.   ANYWAY, I WILL NEVER BOOK WITH THEM!!  SO UNRELIABLE!!        	                2	1	Monday	agoda	positive
1163	            Thieves?100% sure I cancelled a booking. Yet, I didn't not receive a cancellation receipt and was charged a no-show penalty. One might think I simply forgot, but I didn't. And they didn't send a reminder for the booking the day before, as other companies do.I came across many who encountered the same issue, which indicates a pattern. Would highly recommend full vigilance when dealing with this website.        	                1	1	Monday	agoda	neutral
1164	            I followed their links on Google Maps below some hotels. Five different hotels were visited, each one showing a rate that was a fair bit less than other sites, all saying that the dates and rooms I wanted were available.Click to book, enter details and CARD DETAILS including CCV number and every time, five different hotels and a few rooms in each, it tells me the rooms have gone even though it was less that a minute between clicking and entering all my details. I have no issue with directing me to a higher priced room, that's the scam, but getting me to put all my card details in, then NOT booking the room is just plain wrong. I have informed my bank as that shouldn't be allowed.        	                2	1	Monday	agoda	negative

1167	            It has been a long time since I used Agoda. It was already very helpful then, but now it is even better, because it provides access to guesthouse for inquiries which helps to make better choices. And it also partners with various airlines, so every time we book a room, we can accumulate the milage. Last but not least, the website is easy to use.        	                1	5	Monday	agoda	positive

1177	            Horrible customer service!!! Spent $190 on a one night hotel stay for a “guaranteed” room with 2 queeen beds. Get to hotel they give us a room with 1 double bed! After we complain to front desk they give us a room with a king, which did NOT suit our travel needs!!! The hotel shower didn’t drain so there was about 5 inches of water in tub during a shower. We call agoda for a refund.... after being on hold for at least 30 minutes each time we called they said we will call you back.... never did, so we had to call back another 2 times and they offer us $40 back and a $20 credit next time we us them. NO DEAL!  The room said guaranteed for 2 queens on our reservation, you didn’t deliver on your promise! Your credit is no good to us, we will NEVER book with you again!! You can’t even call someone back when you say you will, we spent over 2 hours on this nonsense and $190 on a “guaranteed” room that ended up being worth maybe $50! Spend your time and money elsewhere, you all are a joke!        	                1	1	Friday	agoda	neutral

But we did not modify or cancel it. Called customer service 24/7, no one picked up. Called in the morning 13 min waiting, then reply and putting on hold for 20 min, then they turned off the call.

Show my reservation number she said they didnt even have any rooms available when i booked. I then find that agoda had cancelled my reservation and refunded. An email after said that it was high risk to accept my booking even though I paid upfront? Not impressed as they hadn't a room so had to pay extra £180 for another hotel with a lot of stress and headache. They did not phone to tell me! Just an email about midnight!!!

1238	            After paying for my reservation and receiving my confirmation email, I got another email asking for scanned images of my credit card and photo ID. The email was black and white, didn’t contain company logos, and had a foreign phone number. Everything about it looked suspicious. I searched the website for any indication that this was required information, and found nothing. After waiting on hold for almost twenty minutes, I gave up and sent an email to customer service asking if they did in fact need that information or if it was a scam. The next day, I got an email notifying me that my reservation had been canceled. I called customer service again, and finally spoke with a woman with a very strong accent who told me that I hadn’t sent all the necessary information. They actually wanted me to email them copies of my credit card and driver’s license. My reservation was canceled 48 hours before I’m supposed to be arriving at the hotel for my daughter’s college orientation and there’s very limited space left available in all the hotels around the university. I am absolutely livid. While waiting for my payment to Agoda to be refunded, I had to pay another for another reservation through another booking company. I’ve spent almost $800 for a two night stay in Knoxville, TN. Hopefully I’ll get some of that back. I should’ve paid the extra $30 and booked through Priceline to begin with.        	                1	1	Sunday	agoda	neutral
1239	            I have booked 2 rooms via agoda for hotel hakone terrace. First room with up to 2 adults occupancy &amp; second room with up to 3 adults occupancy which I have paid more cost. Through Agoda's description the more expensive room can occupy up to 3 adults and I have paid the one room price online. However, by the hotel's in charge person and also by agoda's advice via telecon on the spot, I had no choice but was forced to pay extra almost rm500 for 2 nights just to add an additional futon for the third adult in the room! Even though I had wasted more than 30 minutes at the check in counter trying my best to explain it should not be that way, it did not work out. Me and my family were extremely disappointed with agoda. For my lifetime supporting agoda, never had I got into this kind of issue. And What I received from the Agoda staff via telecon was ‘sorry maybe Japan's rule is different.' how on earth should we know when I should personally inform that I have additional adult when your description in agoda written up to 3 adults per room??? Furthermore I have paid extra for the room via online already! Was extremely  angry . please next time mention in your description CLEARLY for additional fee for third person and need to inform you in advance. Feel like being cheated. Please look into it seriously. And also please reply to me an appropriate response. Really would like a refund as well. Thanks.        	                1	1	Sunday	agoda	positive

1274	            I booked a villa with a private pool through agoda.  It seemed too good to be true, I kept going back and checking the listing but there was no doubt that the 'Deluxe Villa' I had booked was the height of luxury with a private infinity pool - confirmed in both the photographs and the amenities list.  I called Agoda to query my booking and they confirmed that the content was wrong.  They said that they would get back to me in a couple of days and allow me to have the correct villa at the reduced price.  And then I never heard anything further!  No replies to emails, on hold for so long I couldn't be bothered waiting any more.  I have cancelled my booking and gone with another provider instead.   Having just checked the Agoda listing again - THEY ARE STILL ADVERTISING THIS VILLA FALSELY.  There are other booking sites out there, don't waste your time with this one.        	                1	1	Saturday	agoda	negative

1278	            Helpful service with some persistence.  We booked 2 rooms in Copenhagen for a 1 night stay at the start of our trip at the Adina through Agoda. We had to cancel one room as my dad was hospitalized prior to departure. Initially they told my husband it was non-refundable, but when we reached the hotel, the agent there told us it was a refundable booking that we made (which is what we thought). She helped us with our connection with Agoda's customer service, and assured them that she showed refundable on the booking, and they agreed and followed through with the refund of my parents' room.

1280	            I booked a night at a 'deluxe apartment' in Manchester through Agoda a few weeks ago for my partner's birthday, at The Works Aparthotel. Apparently this room was supposed to be £500 but according to Agoda we were getting it for the bargain price of £120. Upon arrival we were told by the man behind reception he had been awake for 3 days without a break. The room we were initially showed to was absolutely filthy and stunk, I had to ask the man behind reception to help us work the heating controls as the dial had snapped off, he told us to put a key inside it to twist it (health and safety would have a field day at this place). He then asked us if we wanted to move rooms due to the smell and advised he wouldn't stay there. The room we were then put into was even worse, the fire alarm had been pulled off, the window was smashed, exposed wires hanging from the ceiling and numerous other things. The bedroom had a balcony door which was stuck slightly open, when we tried to sleep all we could hear was blaring taxi horns until 4am, which meant we had to sleep on the sofa in the other room. I have sent all my concerns to Agoda and the hotel, Agoda were unable to get the hotel to reply to them which I find very concerning. They offered me a £20 voucher which I declined as the room cost me 6 times this, I asked the complaint to be looked into by a manager, a few days later another advisor offered me a $30 voucher, this equates to £22.50 at time of writing. They still haven't been able to contact the hotel, I have forwarded all my information and pictures taken to Manchester City Council health and safety and hope they shut down the shambles of a hotel.        	                1	1	Friday	agoda	neutral
1281	            I always check Agoda first when booking hotels, most of the time I will go ahead and book through them. Its always been great value and the hotels have always lived up to expectation. I recently took a chance on one of their one day deals to Villa Tasos in Corfu at £14 a night! It was fine for the money as it was a last minute budget trip this time. (I have also booked expensive trips too) I will definately keep using them .        	                5	5	Friday	agoda	positive

1285	"            I booked a room with Agoda for the first time yesterday. I will NEVER use them again nor would I ever recommend them just based off of my first experience.  I booked the room online and received a message stating that within 10 minutes, I would receive an email with my room details and an email with my login/member information. I waited and waited and never received a thing from them. Finally, after about 45 minutes, I called the number listed on their website for those in the US only to be connected with someone in Bangkok that I could barely understand. Apparently, that is where this company is located and everyone calls the same number for customer service. I told the girl who took my call that I had booked a room over 45 minutes ago and paid with my credit card and still had not received anything from them...no room details...no member or login credentials....nothing.  She told me that the room I booked was no longer available. I asked her why they would charge my credit card for a room that was no longer available and not even have the decency to send me an email or call me to let let me know that. She said, ""the hotel did not get back with us so that means your room is no longer available"".  I was livid because I had wasted over an hour and a half searching for the right hotel in the right area on their website and waited over 45 minutes for a confirmation for my 2 day stay only to find out the room was no longer available!  I told her that they better make darn sure that they do not charge my credit card.  She assured me that they hadn't charged anything on my card. I  then decided to call this particular hotel directly to see if they had received a reservation from Agoda for me. I told the lady that Agoda told me that they did'nt hear back from them so they told me the room was no longer available. The lady at the hotel said, ""We never get back with Agoda. They fax us the reservation and that is that.  We don't call them to confirm. That isn't the way it works"". She told me not to go through Agoda. She said she would book the room for me at the same rate. I finally got an email from Agoda about a half hour later that says (and this is verbatim).  ""Thank you for contacting Agoda Customer Support to cancel your booking. We have confirmed the cancellation of your booking at ___________.  You will pay nothing for this cancellation. Your credit card will not be charged. Thanks for booking with Agoda"". BULL CORN! I called my credit card company right away and told them what happened and they told me that Agoda DID in fact bill my credit card! I was livid and still am because I had to spend another 25 minutes on the phone with my credit card company filing a dispute for the fraudulent charge.  They are in the process of investigating it but I just wanted to share my first and last experience with Agoda. I would not trust these people with my credit card and I hope this is resolved quickly but since they are in Thailand, I am not holding my breath for a quick resolution. I submitted feedback on a survey they sent me right after I got off of the phone with them and have yet to hear back from anyone about this issue. Never again will I use this service and would caution anyone reading this to use another, well established site.        "	                1	1	Thursday	agoda	positive

1303	"            STOP.  Don't get swayed by other reviews of praise. AGODA IS NOT a reliable and trustworthy company. They totally screwed my hotel reservations 3 TIMES !  I had an uncomfortable feeling about my reservation and called the San Franscisco airport hotel myself to confirm my reservation number Agoda gave me. Hotel had NO record of me or an Agoda reservation. This went on 2 more times - even after I received a call back from Jackson at Agoda reassuring me ""all now is fine"".... it wasn't.  Flying back from Maui I was in no mood for any delay getting to my room for sleep. Hotel still could not find my reservation. Only by the desk clerk trying variations of my first middle and last name did he finally find my reservation/rate from Agoda. Even he ""rolled his eyes"" when I told him it was made through Agoda.

1314	            DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY IF YOU EVER NEED A CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON URGENTLY!  I made a reservation for my husband and I did not put my husbands name on the reservation...then I ended up not being able to go....but he did. Well...the hotel would not let him check in because his name was not on the reservation... I tried to contact Agoda over and over and over in everyway possible and could never reach a human.... tried to change the reservation with the confirmation number and the last 4 of the credit card I used, which is also noted on our booking receipt, and the automated service said it was not valid... Could never reach a human... and the automated just hangs up on you if you don't enter the correct information, which I did.... The reservation was never associated to my account either so I could not manage it when signing in!  So, guess what... just lost $356.00 and my husband sitting in a lobby with no room. So now forced to purchase the room again on his own.  I will NEVER use this company again!        	                1	1	Saturday	agoda	negative

1337	            I booked a hotel for a night in Rome through Priceline which funnels you to Agoda.  A couple of months later the price had dropped by 40% and I tried six times to get them to honor a price match, to no avail. Then the morning we  arrived in Rome, the hotel informed us that Agoda never paid them and there was no room available for us.  We had reserved to rooms, and Agoda had charge my credit card three months prior!   Will never use them again.        	                2	1	Wednesday	agoda	neutral

1343	            Awful awful customer service, do not use!After being charged twice for an 8 day stay in hotel we were only in for 2 nights, Agoda did nothing to help except explain to me that I had to prove I had been charged twice because the hotel only had one record of payment - probably because Agoda had the other one.Took three months of ongoing emails back and forth as they 'couldn't get hold of me' while calling me in England at obscure times from Hong Kong.Eventually they told me we can't get hold of you so we're closing the complaint! Despite more emails I was ignored with no refund.Luckily the payments were taken from a credit card so I was able to dispute the charge and the bank took the complaint over and refunded me. Otherwise I would've been charged over £1000 for two nights in a very mediocre hotel in Thailand.        	                2	1	Tuesday	agoda	negative
1344	            Agoda is the worst online agency, I have ever dealt with. We had seen bad reviews, but the price they were quoting of our hotel, was too good to pass up. so we booked in January, given the negative reviews of Agoda, we checked the reservation with the hotel. So we were confident that we would not experience the same thing. We put the credit card dow, they charged a small amount to see it was valid, and then 3 days before we were due to fly out they cancelled. The same day they were supposed to charge us, for no reason. The hotel, then had no rooms available, and we ended up having find a different one. We were careful, and it still happened to us, so I recommend you book it with someone else.        	                2	1	Tuesday	agoda	neutral

1365	            Booking through Agoda for one of the Shanghai Hotel, when I arrived hotel in midnight 2am, the receptionist told me that Agoda did not send my booking information to them, they check this case by using 1 and half hour, up to 3plus am in the midnight. End up, Agoda is asking me to pay directly to the hotel with a higher rate and they will refund the previous payment and the different rate. Alright, I agreed with it. After I came back from Shanghai, almost after 1 month, Agoda still requests me to submit the relevant documents for 3rd times but yet to refund to me. Customer Service efficiency is extremely poor, few different customer service representatives are giving different pieces of information, this show Agoda management is not up to international level. Lastly, until today I DID NOT receive any refund update from AGODA. Agoda doesn't willing to help you, they did not offer a good solution, they did not care of their customer. To be honest, I'm Agoda loyal customer, have been using them so many year, nowadays I found they service getting worst and price keep hiking without offering a better service. I've make up my mind to banned Agoda.        	                1	1	Thursday	agoda	negative

Yesterday when I sent inquiry to solve my problem to Agoda customer care due to the wrong hotel i selected, within 1 hour,  1 agent contacted me and he explained that he already resolved my issue. What the great customer care!! he came back not to discuss with me, but he just updated me that he already followed up with the hotel and my problem already resolved before I talked to him!!

1370	            I Booked a hotel reservation well in advance with booking id 267796149 and booking reference 508024754 for Delhi Hotel The Royal Plaza for 5th and 6th May after making advance payment in Indian Rupees 12142.51( INR Twelve Thousand One Hundred and Forty Two and Paise 51) on 21st April 2018 using my credit card. Got confirmation Receipt also from Agoda. When I reached the hotel with this booking Id print out the hotel reservation desk refused to give me room telling that they have no communication from Agoda regarding this booking and also they told that Agoda is not an approved agent for them. I have to do a fresh booking at a higher rate after paying seperately. I contacted the customer care of Agoda and explained all this but there was no use, I have asked for round of my money for that no reply  from them also.This was a strange and shocking experience.My earnest request is to be very careful with this agent.I have requested for refund of my payment but so far no result.        	                1	1	Wednesday	agoda	negative

The only thing I miss is that you could search for single/private room only in your search. Love that you can choose on some properties to book without a credit card BUT many times the price will go up quite a bit compared to booking with a card, which is annoyinng but understandable as they loose a reservation if u dont show up        	                1	5	Monday	agoda	neutral

1389	            I just booked a room with this website. So unacceptable. They “claimed” that I paid my motel stay was paid in full before I got to the motel. The motel on the other hand said they only got a hold on the room, not payment. I have spend the last 24 hours trying to get a refund. It has put a damper on my vacation and I wish no one to ever use this website. It’s a complete scam. I’m hoping to get my money back but I’m doubting. Use a reputable website like trip advisor or Expedia. I have never had issues with them. Customer service is a joke and I spent over an hour waiting to get a hold of someone. Then they give you the run around like it’s all the motels fault for slowing things down.Plus, they charged me more for the room than the actual motel did. They charged me 97.00 and when I got to the motel it was only 89$. What a rip off. I think I need to call my credit card company and report this fraudulent company. I didn’t authorize them to charge my credit card and then not follow through with the payment to the actual motel.... to be honest I feel like they stole my money.... actually that’s exactly what they did.

1405	            Appalling service . I was on their webpage viewing properties and decided on one and next thing it had taken not one but too bookings before I had clicked book ! And for the wrong hotel !! I immediately rang them to no answer , sent e mails and heard nothing . Now ten days later they are saying the hotel are refusing to cancel the booking ! I’ve rung the hotel and they are not saying that at all !! Agoda replies take days to come and are in pigeon English and can’t seem to see that they have the responsibility to cancel the two bookings that I didn’t evdn make !!        	                1	1	Wednesday	agoda	negative
1406	"            So, is Agoda a total scam or totally wonderful? From the reviews here, it's hard to say. If it helps, we booked a room through Agoda and something went terribly wrong. What happened: the owner of the room we booked failed to pick us up, as agreed, at a very remote airport, and we took the only transport available, which was another hotel's shuttle bus. We booked into that hotel. The no-show hotel was very decent about it and offered an apology and a full refund. Agoda, after first offering a ""gift card"" (no thanks), gave us the refund in a couple of days. So, that was a positive experience with their service desk.

1428	            While researching different businesses to conduct business with in efforts to book my honeymoon trip, I stumbled across agoda.com. I must admit that this has been the worst experience ever as the customer service is horrible. The wait time on the phone can be hours at a time with somebody eventually picking up the phone and hanging up on you. One incident in general as I was calling to make the final payment for my room and while on hold for over an hour I received an e-mail saying that they cancelled my reservation(I have all sorts of proof from phone records, e-mails, etc  to confirm this). In the email it stated that they asked me to update my card, but no prior email or correspondence was provided to me. I immediately called the bank to confirm my funds and nothing from agoda had tried to be processed. Word to the wise, keep everything that you get from these bunch of liars.        	                1	1	Sunday	agoda	negative

1446	            Used Agoda to book two rooms in Pensacola Florida. They sent me confirmations for both rooms. One room for me/husband and one room for my mother.Arrived in Pensacola on scheduled day. While checking into the hotel, they showed me having the two rooms reserved but didn't show any payment. Desk clerk requested payment. After a couple of days, I noticed my credit card bill higher than it should be.Agoda charged me for the two rooms and the hotel clerk charged me for the two rooms. According to the hotel manager, Agoda claims they didn't receive any payment. Filed a dispute against Agoda with my bank who is investigating Agoda. Filed a complaint with my local Better Business Bureau. Filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission against Agoda.I have made MANY calls to their customer service number only to be placed on hold for 30+ minutes. I don't continue to wait and hang up. I've emailed their customer service department over 500 times only to receive three email responses. Once response claims that we cancelled the rooms and are responsible for payment, which is a lie. No one cancelled the rooms that I booked. The second email requested copies of all receipts showing that I paid for each room twice. I've responded with copies of all receipts showing payment to Agoda and showing payment to the hotel. Third response was a survey email claiming that my claim was resolved and asking for my opinion on their customer service. As of today 4/25/2018 I've heard nothing else from Agoda. I'll continue to send email after email after email and continue filing complaint after complaint after complaint until they refund my money.        	                1	1	Wednesday	agoda	negative

1488	            I recently booked a hotel with Agoda on the internet.  I received my hotel voucher and my credit card was debited of the funds.I turned up at the hotel in London and they were fully booked - the hotel tried to book me into a room in a sister hotel but the receptionist said I must look at the room first before they would book me in - having paid £135 for the night on a room only basis I was not prepared to sleep in a room the equivalent size of a broom cupboard !So I went back to the original hotel and asked for a refund - which they could not give me.  I ended up booking a different room myself and chasing a refund from Agoda which i'm still chasing having spent 37 minutes on hold on the phone and having received no response from their customer service team by email.DO NOT USE AGODA - WHEN THINGS GO WRONG THEIR SERVICE IS APPAULING !        	                4	1	Thursday	agoda	negative

1514	            I've used Agoda for quite a while, and it's been fine.  That is, until I ran into a problem and had to contact support.  I went to the contact us page, and it forced me through a bunch of menu's suggesting various areas of the FAQ.  When I finally manage to find the buttons to get past that and call I had to give a booking number, if I didn't have one the call could not proceed.  I was calling about a future booking, I wanted to find out if I could book multiple different room types individually.  I ended up using a booking number I had, and then you get another message that seemed to last forever, suggesting I go look in the FAQ.  I did end up speaking to someone, but I felt the process was unacceptable.  No one who puts the slightest value on my time would make me jump through that many hoops to speak to a human. I then ran into a problem with the booking I eventually made, and it's been 28 hours since I've emailed and I haven't received a response.  Their whole contact experience is unacceptable in my view, and it will be playing a factor on what platform I book my next trip.        	                4	2	Friday	agoda	negative

1519	            I was charged through my debit account twice the amount of the booking.. I am a working mom with a very busy schedule. this was very inconvenient for me. A piece of advice...

1521	"            Bait and switch: I booked a room in London for Agoda's special price of $107 a night. My confirmation for the hotel contained the wrong date. So I called the Agoda's London number and talked to Chris. He said that there was not refund, but I would receive a gift certificate. So I immediately tried to re-book. Within 10 minutes the price for the same hotel went to $470 a night and a ""free cancellation"" statement. Then Chris called from a Hong Kong number to tell me that I would be receiving a full refund instead of a gift card. Good luck with Agoda!!!!!!! You have been warned.

1522	            Beware Agoda!!!!!  misleading, fraudulent and seems to be a scam at the end. I have booked the room via agoda and agoda passed the booking under booking.com that was not stated during the booking process. I found out after I got the confirmation voucher from them. I haven’t got the room I originally booked but I got the room that price matched on booking.com that is completely wrong. Their 24/7 customer service is a joke. Email is absolutely useless... no reply at all. Facebook page hides all the negative comments. Agoda then asked me to pay the additional charge of almost $800 at the hotel when arrival to get the room I originally booked and I provide them the receipt of the payment I pay and they will refund back after 10 days. I feel this hard to believe as their customer service and email is not accessible and unreliable. This is not my fault at all. I don’t want to get any high risks with this scam back company anymore and at the same time I HATE the hotel I booked too. As a 5 star hotel they claimed they are, I found out their customer service is worst than some non star backpackers. I felt negative with the hotel after several emails and calls so I decide to cancel the booking. I rang agoda again and asked the rep to cancel the booking and give me full refund. The rep asked me to send the bank statement to process the refund and I did straight away after spoke to her on phone. Now they sent me they haven’t got my bank statement nor email. This is a big lie. I got the automatic email after I sent the email out. I resent another 3 times with no reply from them but I got the automatic emails instead. Today, when I got home, I called their CSR again but I had left on hold for many times of attempts over 2 hours. No more patience for me anymore, I spoke to my bank and show her the full evidences I got, the bank asked me to fill form and lodge disputed of the transaction. THIS IS A REAL PAINFUL AND NIGHTMARE FROM USING AGODA.Luckily, I knew this issues 3 months in advance before going holiday in mid July. At least I can take a further action against this shady company.        	                1	1	Thursday	agoda	negative

1558	            Stay away from this company at all costs, there are far better booking companies out there.  My experience using their online search and booking system has been a nightmare.  Agoda incorrectly recorded my email address so booking information was sent to a different email address than mine.  Agoda denies this but the email address they recorded on my profile is very similar to mine, but wrong just the same.  After making one successful reservations at an OK hotel, two booking were created without my knowledge and I only discovered them when the charges hit my credit card. Since all emails were being delivered to someone else, I did not know I had a problem with Agoda until the charges hit my credit card.Agoda did not admit their error.  Agoda did not return my calls even after a specific promise to do so.  Agoda did not answer their customer support line promptly; I had to wait over an hour 4 different times to reach a human.  Agoda was not able to locate the email error promptly.  Agoda did not assist me in communicating with the hotels.  I never once was able to reach the same person twice so I spent my time explaining the same problem over and over again on each call.  Agoda’s response was always the same, that I must have made an error and booked the two different hotels in Berlin for the same days andas the reservations were pre-paid and there was nothing they could/would do to assist me.  I reached out to booking.com and they found the problem in under 15 minutes, but referred me  to back to Agoda to resolve it.  Agoda has been giving me the same run around for nearly three weeks.  I’m out nearly 500 euro thanks to Agoda.  Agoda emailed me tonight and assured me that they were very sorry that I failed to cancel my reservation on time(the one I didn’t know I had), but that there was nothing they could do to alter their cancellation policy.I’m through with them.

Basically they are thieves that advertise the incorrect rooms in “error” but then either try and extort extra money out of you (in our case $880 US) or they use the cancellation policy threat! Either way they win and one has to wonder how many times they sell these “incorrectly listed rooms” and keep the cancellation fees! SEEMS LIKE A SCAM TO ME!!

1631	            I used Agoda.com to book a hotel in Dubai as it was the lowest price on the internet but I was unable to go because the flight got cancelled due to bad weather. I told cutomer service rep Lisa at Agoda.com Lisa was very helpful and considerate, and although the reservation was no cancellation and no amendment Agoda.com bent over back wards to help me and finally got the hotel to move the dates a couple of months with no charges. If their were 6 stars I would give agoda.com 6 stars. I would recommend Agoda.com to my friends and family and to any one reading this review.

1641	"            I booked a hotel stay with Agoda yesterday. Today I get an email telling me that the booking was not completed due to a ""system error"". You do not give a proper explanation for why the booking is cancelled, and  you make no effort whatsoever to put a very negative ""customer  experience"" right. You even suggest booking another property but cannot be bothered to explain why. I tried phoning and got fed up after the first 30 minutes on hold. that is after your system hung up on me four times in trying get through. You really really don't want to talk to the people who pay your salary do you. If you are looking for awful customer service and like to be treated with contempt, carry on and book with Agoda.  You won't do it again !        "	                9	1	Friday	agoda	negative

1643	            I made a booking for my daughter via Agoda Website for a hotel in Kuta. It was her first overseas holiday and she asked me to do this for her as I am very experienced at booking/researching holiday accommodation. When making the booking there were lots of deals for Bali Accommodation on various sites including Wotif, Booking.com etc they were all offering the same room with breakfast included. I ended up choosing Agoda as the promotion we booked said that it included transfers and I couldn't work out if the other sites would also include this. A Few days prior to check in I contacted Grand Barong to make sure they would be at the airport for my daughters arrival. They then advised me that transfers were not included and nor was the daily buffet breakfast. I was obviously extremely angry at this as I had spent so long researching which company to book through. I tried to contact Agoda several times and they could not even have the decency to respond or call me book. The hotel sent me a copy of the booking confirmation which says Breakfast is not included. So basically Agoda completely ripped me off. I would never have booked with them if this was not included. I wonder how many more people they do this too??? I will never book with them again and strongly advise no-one else too either. Regards Marcia Florence (Booking ID 247633049).        	                3	1	Friday	agoda	positive

1667	            I found this hotel near the seminar venue through Trivago site partnering with Agoda and ReddDoorz. I booked for 3 nights through Agoda, confirmed and paid it. Agoda even sent me the confirmation letter and receipt on my email. When I arrived at the Hotel, that's when I learned about the overbooking problem, thus I was not accommodated in the hotel I booked. I was never informed beforehand through email, call or text about the problem. I didn't cancel my booking because I know that Agoda will charge me for that. Nrcause I was so tired from a long trip and it was late, I accepted to be transferred to another hotel even though it was very far from the seminar venue. It was so stressful. Agoda promised to refund my travel expenses from the first hotel to the second hotel. But then they did it through gift card only and not by cash!!! So do not book your hotels through Trivago and their partners Agoda and RedDoorz. They are very inefficient in monitoring bookings. They would give you false promises.

1690	            Been using Agoda for at least 7 years been a loyal customer with high numbers of bookings each of my trips, the last  my monthly booking was over 12 bookings.  2 of these booking was messed up due to there gift card system which I manage to select for 3 bookings, turned up at the hotel which they didn't have any details of my booking searched on my app shows PROCESSING!! Luckily they had spare rooms however the other booking they did not so had to locate a last minute accommodations.  This is only part of the issue, the call center takes extremely long for someone to pick the phone and when someone does pick up your speaking to a robot. Why you Ask?? I requested the bookings to be cancelled as it's Agoda error 1 was cancelled the other wasn't.In a nutshell the company has grown so big they just don't care less whether to have your custom or not, end of!!        	                2	1	Thursday	agoda	neutral

1698	            Agoda changes fares with the book now, pay later option.  Excuse is currency exchange rate changed, but there is no way to confirm this, since they use their own internal exchange rates. My bookings increased by 10% in two weeks.   Furthermore, Agoda's policy is that an owner of a hotel can cancel a customer's booking at the last minute and find an alternate venue.  I booked at Star Guesthouse in Phuket, and the owner admitted in double booking the room because he didn't want to pay the expensive 30% fee to Agoda.  My room was cancelled at check in with no refund...instead i was pushed across the street to a one star dump.  I called Agoda immediately,  and they said that their policy permits the owner to do that.   CRAZY!  Will never use Agoda Again!        	                2	1	Wednesday	agoda	negative

1716	            I have been a satisfied client for 4 years but no longer. Recently the site has declined. They now show fake prices when you search, once you go to the register a service charge and a tax is slapped on the price, as if any of these were optional.The final straw that moves me to booking.com was the other day when i booked a room and had to cancel it because my trip was postponed, i got the refund but a couple of hours later the money was re-charged to my card, contacting customer service resulted in canned replies that clearly showed that no one had even read my mail, when i finally asked for a real reply i was told the proof of evidence was on me, i had to dig out documents, statements, proof etc. As if they can't see whether they double charged my account without it.I finally told them what they could do with my 30 dollars, it's not worth my time to recover the stolen funds, i will just vote with my money and never ever book with these scammers again.        	                16	1	Sunday	agoda	negative

1729	            First they send and email confirming that the reservation was done and payment is confirmed, 5 hs later they send me an email demanding a passport copy or they will cancel the reservation in 12 hs. Because all this happened while I was flying there was no way to know that they would cancel the booking and now I find myself at the airport with a canceled reservation.What is more I called their customer service (WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN) and they told me that 5 pm until the next day 9 am is time enough to send the required information. How could I know they needed more information if they already CONFIRMED EVERYTHING. MY ADVICE, STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!        	                1	1	Friday	agoda	negative

1732	            Booked and paid for a suite at the hotel, arrived and did not get the suite due to what I’d paid on Agoda, the hotel (Hallgarth Manor) soley blamed agoda for this, if the price looks too good to be true “it is!”I wouldn’t of booked or stayed in a standard double room at this establishment as there poor. This is were it gets worse.... Rang agoda from hotel and told them the situation, nothing they could do liasing with the hotel as only one suite in hotel and it was now occupied, so they said they refund me $40. This was on 4/3/2018, yesterday I called them as nothing in my account and it’s now the principal of the matter.I was informed that $40 “gift card” was available for me to spend on agoda! Not what I agreed too or was told on the 4th during are telephone call. I asked to speak to manager and got told no, I persisted and was told he’s on a phone call and telling me the same outcome! Agoda try and sell you anything, not give you what you’ve paid for and say anything to get you off the phone!! Terrible, steer clearStill no response from Agoda 4 days after saying a manager would call me, my booking reference is 209941527  I’ve been fobbed off, ripped off and ignored!        	                4	1	Friday	agoda	negative

1738	            Absolutely disgusting. I was informed I had 3 months to redeem a voucher, which I did. I then received 2 more vouchers. However, the vouchers expired much earlier than 3 months, despite what I was told by a call operator (i.e. 3 month expiration). The 1st voucher expired before I even knew about it. I called the customer care, which was everything but of assistance. I tried to book a room using my last voucher on the last day and discovered it expired before 24h00. Not happy!

1763	            To put how angry I am into perspective, I have never written a bad review for any company, in saying that: agonda customer service has been absolutely absurd. 2 out of my 3 bookings I made for my honeymoon were incorrectly quoted. I had a confirmation of price in AUD with both bookings and when I got to the hotel they tried to charge me in US, which ended up being over $200 more expensive for each booking. After multiple emails and an hour on hold they amended one of the bookings. The other they refused and said I had to pay the US amount and they would refund me the money back. Weeks later and 25 back and forth emails and they have still not paid my money back. To make it worse, they made up an email with my name to book through their sister company booking.com and used the confirmation price from the made up email against me. The person on the phone was also rude and when I asked to speak to the manager she lay out refused. Still no resolution. Futures users be warned.        	                1	1	Saturday	agoda	negative

1802	            I have made a booking with Agoda for the Meeru in the Maldives with free cancellation till the 30th July. Booked and confirmed on the 24th February. On the 25th February I received and email from Agoda threatening to cancel my booking if I didn't send them photos of my credit card and passport within 5 hours or they would cancel the booking. 5 hours later of trying to get to customer service (practically inexistent) my booking was cancelled without my permission. Their reasoning was to prevent frode...However, my other booking to the Cocoon resort, which is MORE EXPENSIVE is still there.        	                3	1	Sunday	agoda	neutral
1803	            I’ve been traveling in SE Asia for six months now and I’ve booked every single hotel with Agoda.  Their prices are okay but my big issue with them is with the reviews.  I always leave a review because I know my experience may determine whether or not a guest stays at the hotel in question or not. Agoda always publish my positive reviews, there’s never a problem there, they go on the website immediately. Out of the numerous hotels I’ve booked I’ve only had a couple of really bad ones.  I’ve left a negative review on each occasion, but Agoda refused to publish them. Agoda are biased towards good reviews, if you leave a detailed review with negative overtones they don’t publish the review.  They’ll publish a one word or one sentence negative review but rarely ones of any length.  So herein the issue lies; how can customers establish a balanced opinion of a hotel if Agoda decide to omit negative reviews?The answer is you can’t.  By omitting constructive, negative reviews Agoda are creating a distorted picture.  Their selective publication of reviews create an imbalance on median opinion, which suggests their objective is to sell rooms, by concealing negative aspects. I’ll use booking sitcom in future.        	                7	1	Sunday	agoda	negative

1806	            I've used agoda 3 times and 2 of the experiences were bad.  I won't use them again.  They booked me into a hotel and the power went out in the room when I put the plastic key in.  It took the hotel all day to fix it.  Then after dinner the power sparked and flamed and went out again.  Neither the hotel nor Agoda would help me.  Terrible customer service.

1809	            As a hosteller, I think that this site is lacking in quite a few functions and features. I think that they cater to the guests way too much while leaving the hosts in the dark. For example, on the site, you cannot know your guest's phone # prior to when they check in! This is the most frustrating thing about Agoda. How can I get in touch with my guest beforehand??? Furthermore, you cannot review your guests at all. Without this feature, there is an unfair shift in power between host and guest. The guests are allowed to leave a horrible review if they wish with no consequences whatever. Who in their right mind would allow this kind of system? The main plus with Agoda is good exposure on their site and other sites. They have really effective advertising. I'll give them that. And their customer service used to be pretty good. Now I believe it is automated in Asia. So that is over and done with.        	                8	2	Saturday	agoda	positive

They told me they informed Agoda.com since they don't get the booking details. So agoda.com could have contacted me, but they didn't. I had to find an alternative hotel myself, without any support of Agoda. They told me I could get a voucher of them instead of my money back... Since the hotel suggested themself to cancel the booking, I should get a full refund. Finally they send me this: You must first agree that you will not do and will not say anything bad about our Company. (B) Do you agree to this?Seriously? I highly recommend using other OTA's like hotels.com or tripadvisor, since they would have contacted me before arrival and finding an alternative location!So be aware of Agoda.com!        	                1	1	Tuesday	agoda	positive

I went to my online Agoda portal and our trip showed up canceled. I called Customer service and after a 1hr hold I spoke with a women could not explain to me why my trip was canceled asked to speak with a supervisor she put me on hold for another 20 min then said I could not speak with supervisor and that she could not do anything to fix the mistake Agoda did by canceling trip. Asked for the agents name and would only give me her first name. This company is shady and I would never recommend even to my worst enemy.        	                1	1	Saturday	agoda	negative

1859	            Thought I’d review Agoda to help others after seeing a few negative reviews before booking. I had used Agoda approx 8 years ago without problem and wondered if standards dropped. I am usually cautious but booked anyway as the price was great for a London hotel. Delighted to say all went to plan. I called up to check on the day of my booking and hotel had the reservation. On arrival all was fine also. So I would have no reservation in recommending Agoda for a hotel booking in the UK at least.

Things I paid 5 DAYS in advanced at 1,000 bht a night - the manager has refused to give me a refund or offer any compromise.

1868	            Hotel in Dubai booked 8 weeks ago and cancelled 1.5 days before I fly out. I was initially told that he hotel was closed down and then later that the hotel was fully booked. Really?!! The alternatives they proposed were not available. Nightmare to get hold of the right people to change the booking to another hotel, have spent hours on the phone.  They eventually came good, booked me into a better hotel and did not charge me any upgrade free.  Breakfast was not included in the new booking. Agoda agreed that I could claim this back from them direct, after the stay,  as long as I provide the receipt from the hotel.        	                2	4	Friday	agoda	positive

1870	            Be careful when booking with Agoda. In my experience, Agoda uses a very rigid rules of 12-day limit for the cancellation. It charges heartlessly although the cancellation is based on health problems. In my case, I booked the Prince Palace Hotel in Bangkok for my relative. Then I canceled it 4 days before the check-in date because my relative had a serous health problem and had to be hospitalized in a hospital in Bangkok. I had made numerous follow ups through the App and also in person at the Hotel Front Desk. But st the end, they totally ignore any reason of my request and deny the refund. In addition, I also doubt about the quality of Agoda system and its staff. When I submit the dispute of the charges, staff claim that didn’t receive my request for cancellation unless I contact them by phone or email. In fact, this statement does not exist in the Agoda cancellation policy. When I complained that ‘what’s wrong as I requested through the oficial Agoda App. Staff responded that ‘You may cancel through the Agoda App, but it does not mean that you will get the refund.’ This is a harsh response to grab the money based solely the ground that  the cancellation was less than 12 days. I understand the rules, but the humanitarian grounds should be also considered on case by case basis. Please think twice when you prepare to deal with Agoda.        	                1	1	Friday	agoda	negative

1872	            I would give this a 0 if I could. I don’t normally write feedback like this but I have to personally take time to write this long comment to warn everyone about their company and please please please stay away from them because you will lose your money. My husband and I used their service to book our hotel in February and received a confirmation letter for March? We called them immediately to sort out the error and after waiting in line for them to call the hotel what so ever, they could not come up with a solution to solve the problem beside not giving us a refund as we won’t be able to use the room. We were sure to carefully check the dates before booking and they try to blame it on us. They try to take your money and technically saying you are stupid therefore you lose your money but YOU ARE NOT! When you pay lots of money for a nice hotel you wanted and enjoy your vacation you would not want to make mistake with your booking (especially when you are overseas). They are a scam company so don’t trust their service. Staff won’t help you anyway because they are very unprofessional and just frustrate you even more trying to talk to them.        	                1	1	Thursday	agoda	negative

1875	            I find agoda is okay. I booked hotels with them, quite a few in one go, for different dates. However, when I go to my bookings with them in their app, I noticed that all my bookings are all over the place! It isn't in any date order, and I had to unravel what and which dates my hotels are! For eg hotels booked for:  Mar 14th - 18th, Feb 6th- 9th, Mar 4th - 8th, Mar 2nd - 3rd. Other rival booking sites put them all in date order, so it's easier to manage.

1882	            If I could give a 0 star I would.  This company is not for its customers  at all even if it is their screw up.  I booked a hotel in DC for April well so I thought was April when the receipt came in the mail it said for February  19th this date was never even looked at so not sure where it came from.  I called them as soon as I noticed maybe 20 min.  After and they said theyvwould try and reach out to have the issues fixed.  Well 4 calls later and several emails saying they attempted to contact the hotel to change the days and still no answer a week later I called again and was told that they could change it but instead of the $130 a night it will be $230  night. Oh and if I choose to cancel my card would be charged anyway.  Well I have news for you guys charge my card HA.  I called my bank today and candles that darn card so good freaking luck with that.  Never use this company to book just save your time and energy  and use Hilton or some other chain!        	                1	1	Wednesday	agoda	positive

1885	            Daylight robbery DON NOT USE! Agoda is a company that put their customers second best. I had a dispute with my bank because I did not recognise the payment, this was shortly cancelled and I informed Agoda that there might be a dispute but for them to ignore and consult me ASAP. I specifically made this clear to several customer service advisors. A week after my booking, AGODA cancelled the booking where the cancelled dispute was but also for all my other bookings made with them over 2 week period. It’s not been 3 weeks since they cancelled my bookings and even though they have sent me confirmation of the refund they have not refunded any money back to my account or my bank. When I took this up with their various teams, no one could answer where my money has gone to. Each time I speak to a different advisor they blame someone else in the process ie my bank, their bank, the system, the finance team...I am having to go to their trading standards equivalent - CSS, who are currently dealing with my request but this can take some time. Pay extra with a more reputable booking company because it’s not worth the risk of losing your money and hotel bookings.        	                1	1	Tuesday	agoda	negative

1891	"            The frontend of this system is absolutely horrible. We booked a room using a button that said ""Pay Now"". Payment options included (EN VERBATIM) ""Using credit card or other methods"" Nowhere was there anything outlining 'credit card only'. We provided our debit card, expected the funds to be pulled ASAP due to selecting the 'Pay now' option.1. Never received confirmation email with booking info.2. Turns out Agoda is advertising this room as 'Pay Now', when it isn't.When we called Radisson, the hotel we booked, they said the reason the payment did not process is because they only take credit cards. Agoda's website/system on our end however, AND their customer service reps, are insisting that we wait until we arrive at the hotel and the hotel will take our payment. This was a LIE, plain and simple. But because the booking is non-refundable, that means the hotel needs PRE-PAYMENT. Both the hotel and Booking.com refuted this fact, that I need to provide pre-payment or the hotel will cancel the booking. But evidently the hotel is not communicating this well enough to Agoda so they can change their booking system, or Agoda is not listening and being willfully ignorant so they have not tailored their system and their notices to inform every potential customer that pre-payment AND a credit card is required by the hotel. So if either A. I had never called the hotel and confirmed payment had not been received, or B. Called Agoda after waiting 24 hours for them to fulfill my request to be emailed our booking confirmation - OUR BOOKING WOULD HAVE BEEN CANCELLED, and we would have shown up to the hotel next week WITH NO RESERVATION whatsoever, and no correspondence with us about this matter whatsoever. The Agoda rep was rude and also forcefully insisted I had selected the 'Pay Later' option at checkout when I absolutely was given, and selected a 'Pay Now' option. When I told off the rep for trying to tell me what I selected, I asked to speak to their duty manager. He obliged and said they'd call me back. It's been 12 hours and I've not had one call in response.Abysmal, horrifying, pathetic service and experience and we've not even left on our trip yet. As a consequence, we have kicked Agoda AND Radisson Blu Berlin to the curb and have rebooked with another hotel through Booking.com like we should have in the first place. AVOID AGODA AT ALL COSTS. THEY WILL SCREW UP YOUR TRAVEL PLANS.        "	                4	1	Monday	agoda	negative

1896	"            On 19th Jan 2018, I was travelling to Hong Kong with my parent for 2 nights. As I knew the room in Hong Kong is small so I booked 2 family rooms for 3 adults. When I checked in, the receptionist kept repeating ""family room"" with their own language (maybe Hindi) which I do not understand. After a few minutes, the guy who standing besides the receptionist asked me how many people is with me, I answered there are 3 of us. After 10 minutes, they passed me 2 keys tab and told me the rooms are located at 6th floor (the reception at 16th). At that time, I felt very strange on their behaviours because I saw people who checked in before me were lead by their staffs but I was not. However, since this is not my first time to live here (yes, this was my second time lived in Chung King Mansion) so I was able to find my way to go down. When I opened the door, this is double room not family room. And, I went to check another room, it also is a double room. So I was given 2 double rooms instead of family rooms without any informing!!So, I went back to the reception (I climbed 10 floor of staircase as the lift is not stopping every level) and argued. The guy was approaching and asking:""there are 3 of you right"" ""yes"" "" then the double rooms are correct"" ""but I paid for family rooms not double rooms"" Then, the guy went back to counter and talked with another women in their own language. After a while, the guy came back and said that was their mistake as they only reserved 1 family and 1 double room (they totally did not mention it when I checked it) he asked 3 of us to squeeze into 1 family and he will refund half of price. He showed me that Agoda will give them HKD1960 from my booking, so that he can refund me HKD 980 (but I paid Agoda S$390.25 with the exchange rate that I got from money changer is 5.8, so I should get HKD1132 from them). He also showed me how ""big"" of family room, it's just 2 king size single beds!! I said this is impossible to us to stay, so I want at least 1 family room and 1 double room and the hotel should refund half of the price to me. He said not possible because Agoda is holding their money for one month so they cannot refund (he changed his mind after talked with the women (not receptionist), maybe that women is main person in-charge but English not good) and he asked me cancel this booking and went to find another hotel as the hotel was fully booked and he really cannot give me two family rooms. He said their hotel rules are not refundable but he will tell Agoda to refund me (I'm pretty sure that he will tell Agoda I did not show up because there was no evidence to show Agoda I was there if I really walked away that time). I rejected his suggestion as I suffered an exchange loss even I got refund. So I asked he could give me 1 family and 1 double for first night. He promised he will give me another 1 family room on my second day.So, I went back to reception to checked out the double room to get their promised family room. I was in reception at around 9am and the guy talked with me was not there, only the women and another guy. I said I want to check out the double room and get the family room, the women asked me sit down and wait a while. After 10 minutes (there is no other customer at reception and they were sitting there doing nothing), I was a bit angry so I went to the counter, they asked me to wait for the guy as he is the one who deal with me. After I asked how long I have to wait, they said he will come at 10am (yes, they was expecting me sitting at their reception for 1 hour and do nothing). I was so angry and told them why I have to keep waiting? Why their mistake becomes my problem? They just kept saying ask me to wait for the guy, he will come at 1030am (yes, they changed the timing again). So I asked:"" what time the guy will come? Just now you said 10am now you said 1030am, what's the real timing"" ""it's around 1030am"" answered by another guy who were sitting with the women. ""So its confirmed 1030am"" ""yes"" ""ok, then I will come at 1030"" so, the women was sitting there without saying anything but showed me her black face.So, I went back to reception at 11am (just in case the guy still not showing up at 1030am) and I gave the guy the key for double room. Within 5 minutes, he gave me another key and told me it's located at 6th floor and nothing more. Then, I went and checked it's another double room! I really fed up to climb another 10 floor and argue, and I believed they will tell me same story as Agoda is holding their money so that they cannot do anything. Also, I already wasted my whole morning for nothing, it's really no point for me going back to see their black faces with no respond! They absolutely no intension to give me another family room since I tried on my first day.So, I decided to make a complaint to Agoda and asked for a refund since hotel claimed Agoda is holding their money. I emailed my situation in details to Agoda, they replied that they will investigate my case and give me an update. So after few days, they said they checked with hotel and there was nothing wrong from hotel side as the price of double room is higher than family room. Out of goodwill, Agoda willing to give me U$35 gift card to me. I very disappointed and replied that the gift card is useless to me as I have no travel plan for future. Then, I received an email from Agoda asked me to fill in satisfactory form. Then I just noticed that my case was closed by Agoda without any efforts from them!!So, I called to customer center and told them  I'm not satisfy with their answer, I asked them to investigate again. Then I just realised that Agoda misunderstood that the hotel gave me 1 family and 2 double rooms in one night, so they felt like hotel gave enough compensation to me! From the statement, I knew that hotel gave wrong information and Agoda just blindly follow! After Agoda confirmed that the hotel only provided 1 family and 1 double room, they said they can give S$89.20 in cash. I paid nearly S$400 but they not even to compensate 1/4 of the full amount. Thus, I very angry and asked them to give me proof of posting, and they yet to give me but replied that customer satisfaction will reply me shortly! I think they will close my case AGAIN! Since Agoda so irresponsible, I will advise all Travellers not to book any hotel from them anymore because they will just satisfy hotel side not customer!

1905	            Agoda destroyed my holiday. Their T&amp;C's state that if you do not show up at the hotel, they will charge you for the first night's stay. This is highly misleading - 4 days before our arrival, they tried to charge my card (which had been replaced a week earlier due to damage) for the entire stay with no notice, and cancelled the hotel when the payment failed, stranding myself and my pregnant girlfriend in Tokyo with nowhere to stay.I ended up having to take the best of a bad batch of available rooms from a business hotel via Booking.com and take twin beds. Very romantic, thanks Agoda.Agoda's site has no way to change card details once a booking has been made, you have to call them at international rates to make any amendments - any other site I have used for bookings offer these amendments as standard online. Archaic is not the word.Their customer support could not have been ruder or more obtuse. They refused to answer basic questions and instead posted irrelevant clips of their T&amp;C's which had no relation to what I was actually asking. At one point they refused to reply to me despite the fact I had REPLIED to their email, stating I had failed to use the proper channels.Frankly, this company is dangerous and shouldn't be allowed to operate. I will never, ever use them again and have banned the use of this site by anyone at the companies I am involved with. Don't risk your holiday with this company - I have learned a very hard lesson about quality of service over cost.        	                2	1	Friday	agoda	negative

Also we had a terrific experience with the customer service. We had accidentally booked a hotel for the wrong dates, which meant we had booked a hotel for the current night. The current time of day was 21:30 so it was late and we were tired. But we called customer service and a very professional, competent and well articulate employee answered the phone. She helped us locate the booking and called the hotel to change the dates, while we were on hold. After 3minutes of waiting she got us back on the line and said everything was arranged and that there was no problem.Hands down the best customer service we have ever experienced.

1914	            They allowed anyone to post a listing of hotels, and rooms without a cross check to see if the hotel is legit. I booked a room In Paris, and the guy uses the address of the Accor hotel near Eiffel towel with modern pictures of the room, the name is Aparthotel Adagio Paris, located at 14 Rue du Théâtre Paris France 75015. He wants to approve first, then wants WhatsApp chat, then 500 euro deposit. When I called Agoda's customer service, they let me wait on the phone 13 minutes, didn't pick up, then on the chat they said they cannot do anything, so don't make booking here, when you have to get approval, because this scammer wants your credit card, and they don't actually own the hotel you want to book. The set up of this hotel website is super easy for scammers to post a listing, and you have to fill your credit card number, and all details including the bank that issue it. Their staff is very unprofessional and they made me wait for 35 minutes on the chat, before they say they cannot do anything.        	                1	1	Wednesday	agoda	positive

However, it appears that they add on taxes afterwards (very deceptive when comparing prices) and do not show room options, such that you will be getting a lower quality room, and paying more than you bargained for when the taxes are subsequently added!        	                2	1	Sunday	agoda	neutral

I will never believe people have nothing else to do than after booking find review sites in order to give them 5 star reviews???!! lol.  They make the reviews themselves in order to bring their low rating up.  Agoda are DISHONEST SCAM company that does NOT make it right to its LOYAL clients.

1957	"            They are dishonest, their review system is fake!! They pick and chose which reviews they publish based on how much commission they receive. I asked them about this, they said they screen reviews only to make sure they are suitable. However, I went back to them and said to my review (aside from being negative) was polite.. and even if it wasn't suitable why no notification saying it wasn't like every other website does? Agoda decided they don't want to answer me now, it's been 2 months with constant chasing. So this pretty much proves they manipulate their review system to suit themselves. I'm sure if you left a negative review on a 2* it would be posted - they don't care. But try doing that for a 5* hotel and you'll see for yourselfSo if you continue to use Agoda, enjoy the 5* hotel you stay in which is supposed to be amazing, but wasn't..  all thanks to Agoda for manipulating their reviews making sure you hit the ""book"" button        "	                1	1	Wednesday	agoda	positive

1987	"            The hotel we stayed at was horrendous, totally incorrect listing and we left after 1 night. When i spoke to Agoda they originally seemed concerned and offered me a $50 gift card to apologise for my experience, but things got way worse. The hotel would not offer me a refund as they stated I stayed all the booked nights, I evidenced to Agoda that this was not the case and they tried to pursue a refund. They couldn't seemingly get hold of the hotel but continued to stay loyal to them. Eventually they offered to front the refund for the nights we didn't stay. in a flurry of confusion also offered another $50 giftcard. this was then retracted within the next email as ""please disregard the giftcard"". really ??. by the end of our dialogues they seemed to have little caress for the state of the hotel and obviously were going to do nothing about it despite its absolute state. They don't care about their customers and really dont know how to support them, TOTAL JOKE.        "	                1	1	Friday	agoda	neutral

However, was informed a week before the reservation sate by email that the credit card had expired and was only given 24 hours to respond. We were already travelling through Europe by then and only had the opportunity to check our emails every 2-3days. This caused us having to rebook our hotel at a more expensive price with little options on hotels. Poor service considering they only provided 24 hours when we booked and given them 10 months notice in advance.

I received an email 2 days before my stay saying I cancelled my reservation.  When I called they said it was cancelled due to their fraud procedure.  When I called and talked to them they said there was nothing they could do to reinstate my reservation.  They stated I had to go back on their website and rebook the exact room class and that if there was a price difference then they could adjust it to the price of my original reservation.  Well, that room class was now not available and again they said there was nothing they could do.  I tried to talk to a manager but they refused.

2031	            The website kept changing my selections and when I booked a $61 hotel the  email confirmation said $98. There was no easy way to remedy the problem online and their phone number sticks you in a loop. Stay away from this business.

2035	            I am only giving a one star rating because there isn't a NO STAR rating available.Agoda is a bunch of crooks. We operate accommodation establishments in South Africa and although guests that book through Agoda have stayed in our establishments and enjoyed their stay, we do not receive payment and have no direct communication with Agoda. Emails requesting payment are ignored and phone calls go straight to mail box. When I contacted a guest recently, he told me he had received an email from Agoda saying that his account with had been settled. Not true!!!!        	                1	1	Thursday	agoda	positive

2041	            I used twice this last week to book a hotel. The first time I got a fraud protection email asking me to scan and email the front and back of my DL and CC. I didn’t comply for obvious reasons. I got a phone call from Agoda later and told them I’m not sending and answered a couple questions. Room was then booked. A week later I booked the same hotel with the same CC. Same email again from Agoda. I got no call. I called Agoda which is a foreign call if you are in US and held for 5 min before I hung up. I arrived at hotel and Agoda cancelled my reservation. I was able to book a room directly w hotel using the same CC no prob. Hated the whole experience.  Not worth the intense haslte and time while traveling.        	                1	2	Wednesday	agoda	negative

I was offered alternative accommodation in another building which was old, substandard, small and dark which I refused.

I could not get Agoda to refund my money even though they had not provided the accommodation as advertised on their website.

2053	            This is just to warn others. I've been using booking.com for awhile now and had not encountered any issues like this.  When I was cancelling a booking on agoda app, it had mentioned that it was free but after cancelling, I got charged based on the hotel's cancellation policy. Because it was for 5 nights I lost a fair bit of money. Some may say that I was careless or had not checked properly but I'm sure that Agoda had mentioned that there was no cancellation cost, otherwise I wouldn't have cancelled at all.

2072	"            Normally I do not share my personal frustrations, but I must share my recent experience with AGODA in order to enlighten and warn others.My booking (ID 231583649) was confirmed in early October 2017 for stay commencing 31 December 2017, under the ""pay later"" option.  In late December 2017, before the cut-off date when I would be charged for the booking, I requested in writing - and received back in writing - a delay by one day so my stay would commence on 1 January.  I received an email confirmation from AGODA with a revised hotel voucher.On 1 January I was running late so at 5pm I called the hotel to tell them to hold my room as I would probably arrive about 9pm and didn't want them to assume I was a no-show.  The hotel informed me that I had been expected the previous night, I was already marked as a no-show since 31 December, and there was no room available anymore.I immediately called AGODA customer service and was assured that there must be some mistake and they would call me back.  About 1 hour later I received email confrimation that all was in order and to please proceed to the hotel.  For some reason I didn't have a good feeling, so I immediately called the hotel to confirm that I now had a room.  The hotel said no, we already told AGODA we have no rooms.Back to AGODA call center again, and got pushed up the ladder and after re-explaining my predicament and being put on hold multiple times I was told that I would be moved to a different hotel of equivalent or greater quality.  I agreed.   The AGODA mobile app was updated to show the new address, but I did not yet receive an email with the new voucher.  About 9pm I arrived at the new hotel and was informed they had no booking for me.  I showed them the data in the app, but they were unable to accept that and required a voucher.Back to AGODA call center again, who assured the email voucher had been sent.  At 11pm I received the email voucher and was allowed to checkin.  The hotel then asked me to sign accepting additional internet &amp; parking charges not covered by AGODA, as this was a ""resort property.""  Back to AGODA call center again, who told me that I was responsible for extra charges.  I explained that I did not request a resort property, the original hotel had free internet &amp; parking: I had been offered the new hotel at no additional cost to me, and I had been moved because of AGODA's mistake.  I refused to pay.About 1am on 2 January I received a phone call from AGODA to assure me that all had been taken care of, and that an email and fax had been sent to the hotel explaining that AGODA will assume the extra charges.  On checkout the next evening I was informed that no correspondence had been received from AGODA, and that I was responsible to pay resort fees!Back to AGODA call center again, who assured that everything had already been taken care of.  Not.  Finally, AGODA did contact the hotel and did assume all extra charges.My advice to people planning to use AGODA: you should not automatically trust AGODA.  The data on the mobile app does not reflect reality.  And normally, a signed document issued by a global company should be considered trustworthy, but you cannot trust an AGODA hotel voucher.  And you cannot trust an AGODA customer service agent, they will say what you want to hear, and move on to the next customer.  Whatever AGODA writes or says you should verify with the hotel yourself.Use AGODA.com at your own peril.        "	                1	2	Saturday	agoda	neutral

2080	            We decided to spend Christmas and New Year  Eve festive season in Manila from 24th Dec 2017 to 1st Jan 2018 and we used Agoda.com to book our accommodation with Touristation @ Crowne Bay Tower Apartments.     Our flight ETA 9.30 pm into Ninoy Aquino Internationa Airport in Manila was delayed by 4 hrs. due to the typhoon they had in the Philippines !     By the time we got into apartment reception office, it was about 2.00 am and staff allocated us a 1 Bedroom Deluxe Apartment on the 6th Floor.         The apartment itself was nice but we did not sleep well, as the traffic noise from the main Roxas Blvd. was too noisy !     The following morning, we seek the help of the reception staff to request for a change of apartment to quieter apartment.  The staff were all very helpful and understanding, and they straight away arrange with the owners of the apartments, and they changed our 6th floor apartment to another apartment on the 8th floor and this time it is located in the opposite quieter side facing the airport !     Although the apartment is of different layout but we were most grateful for the quiet bedroom now and we enjoyed the lovely air condition and a quiet sleeping place now !     After a couple of days stay, the staff informed us that they will reimburse us the price difference and they also came to change their previous bedroom curtains to a nicer design curtains with black out material and it absolutely made so much difference in enhancing the look of the bedroom and we could hardly hear any disturbing noise now !     The staff also present us with a gift fruits basket, as a token of their apology for our patience and goodwill with them !  The staff explained that the fruit basket was from the owner of that apartment on the quieter 8th floor !     If I may be allowed to mention those great staff of Touristation @ Crowne Bay Tower Apartment, it would done with gratuity and appreciation for all their fabulous help and warmth to make our stay in their apartment a most rewarding experience !       Here are the following names of the staff who served us beyond their call of duty :1)  MJ ( Mary Jane )2)  Jho3)  Tim4)  Pam5)  Sydney      Hope Agoda.com can send our words of appreciation and gratitude to the owner of our apartment No. 810 that we stayed in !   And many thanks to Agoda.com for your competitive pricing for all the accommodations !      Thank you for letting us have this opportunity to give credit to those wonderful staff at Touristation @ Crowne Bay Tower Apartment !     Keep up the good work !

2086	"            Get confirmation from the hotel of reservations you make through Agoda even when they have taken your money. On 10th April 2017 I booked 10 nights in hotel on south coast of Sri Lanka through Agoda to arrive on 20th November 2017. On 16th November I phoned Agoda who confirmed hotel booking and confirmed balance had been taken from my bank account.The hotel had no knowledge of my reservation when I arrived on 20th November (three hour drive from airport through Colombo, arriving 8pm in pouring rain)Hotel manager stated the next morning they had CEASED TRADING with Agodo  'about a year ago' - certainly before 12th April when I made booking - because Agoda ""MADE RESERVATIONS FOR GUESTS BUT DID NOT PAY HOTEL""I found another hotel during my stay in Sri Lanka with exactly the same story: They had been unable to get money from Agoda for guests that had paid for reservations so ceased trading with them.AGODA ARE STILL ADVERTISING THE HOTEL THAT CEASED DEALING WITH THEM 'ABOUT A YEAR AGO'  On 21st November I started contacting Agoda, eventually getting a refund.  They wished to award me a £27 voucher as compensation.  This was of no use to me as I will never deal with Agoda again. Yesterday the £27 was accredited to my bank account after numerous phone calls.        "	                5	1	Wednesday	agoda	positive

2096	            We booked a holiday home for a family of two adults and one child early (almost four months before our trip) because we knew that the destination was going to be packed for the new year 2018. Agoda cancelled our booking on the date of our arrival via email. We had been travelling four hours from south of Goa to get to our new destination only to notice that there was no room for us. After calling to London customer service and refusing to let this go, they agreed to arranged us a hotel nearby. We settled that we are going to go and wait at the hotel so they can make their arrangements, we waited almost two hours and left to find a place for the night. Later that night we got an email that verified the booking they made to the hotel but by this time we were elsewhere, upset and tired (especially our son), it was too late. After calling several times to London they agreed to give us all our money back, thanks to the customer service man who was very understanding at this point. I don´t recommend Agoda to anybody, I usually contact the hotels directly and nothing like this has never happened before.        	                1	1	Tuesday	agoda	neutral
2097	            They failed to book my hotel after display a successful screen. Call them so many times, they offered another hotel which is not available at their price specified. Then they refuse to follow up again, not even calling me after I called them over 10 times seeking for further instruction how to proceed my booking. At the end, I got no room on arrival and need local police help for booking another hotel.        	                1	1	Tuesday	agoda	neutral
2098	"            FALSE ADVERTISING!!!  We would never have known, except we booked a second stay at the same hotel on Agoda.  We booked the first stay and paid EXTRA for breakfast.  The second stay we did not need breakfast (going to brunch that morning).  When we got to the hotel, they said that all rooms got continental breakfast.  I showed them the Agoda booking receipts and one showed breakfast and one did not.  They said we just got the free continental breakfast.  That was it.  We could pay the hotel more for an American hot breakfast.  I contacted Agoda after our vacation and they refunded half the difference after I made quite a fuss.  I think Agoda should change the language regarding this hotel to explain that there is no need to pay extra for the free breakfast rather than offering a pricer breakfast option.  Also, if there is a difference between what you get when you book from Agoda v. what you get when you book from the hotel, there should be a warning notice on the Agoda website (e.g. ""if you book from Agoda, you will get LESS than what you get if you book directly from the hotel."").

2124	"            Hi everyone,Please be careful with AGODA! They will lead you until the payment making you thinking that you are booking one thing but at the end you are booking less than what they promised!Today I have make one reservation with a ""BREAKFAST INCLUDED"" filter active, I have selected the first option that appeared below that filter and at the end I DON'T have breakfast on my reservation! AGODA pathetic answer was ""The part where you see 'Breakfast included' is just a filter that shows rooms that could have the breakfast included on it.""""filter is a higher-order function that processes a data structure (usually a list) in some order to produce a new data structure containing EXACTLY those elements of the original data structure for which a given predicate returns the boolean value true."" (filter definition on wikipedia)I will repeat the key word, EXACTLY.If a ""BREAKFAST INCLUDED"" filter is set it should retrieve EXACTLY all options which have...yes, you know it...it should retrieve EXACTLY all options which have ""BREAKFAST INCLUDED""! But not on AGODA!This clearly shows the posture and the way AGODA conducts their business: bad faith. Run away from AGODA!Best regards!        "	                1	1	Thursday	agoda	neutral
